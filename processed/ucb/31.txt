Colleges and universities receiving federal funding are required to make certain certifications. The applicant for federal funding must certify, among other things, that neither it nor its principals have been debarred or suspended from participating in any federal program, and that they have not been convicted of or had civil judgments entered against them for fraud or certain other offenses.

COBRA (COBRA, Health Care Continuation Coverage Requirements)
This law requires covered employers (20 or more employees) offering group health plans to provide employees and certain family members the opportunity to continue health coverage under the group health plan in a number of instances when coverage would otherwise have lapsed.
