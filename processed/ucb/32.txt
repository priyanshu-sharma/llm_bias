Senate Faculty Ombudspersons (OMB)(link is external)
The Senate Faculty Ombudspersons (OMB) are faculty who function as an “organizational ombuds,” providing peer advice on conflicts and disputes in a private and informal manner. OMB subscribes to a code of conduct ensuring impartiality and confidentiality, but is not a Confidential Resource in the sense of the UC Policy on SVSH. In this way OMB differs from Student and Staff Ombuds. Rather than being trained professional ombudspersons, OMB are Senate faculty members; as such, they are Responsible Employees (see section 7.3.1) who must notify OPHD if they learn about violations of the UC Policy on SVSH.

50 Years of Title IX: A Landmark Civil Rights Law in Education
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
Signed on June 23, 1972, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal funding. The majority of primary, secondary and higher education institutions in the United States receive federal financial assistance.
Since 1972, Title IX has become an important civil rights law. One lasting impact of Title IX is that the law afforded women access to the same athletic opportunities as men in educational settings. Title IX greatly expanded women’s participation in sports.
In 1977, Catherine MacKinnon created a framework defining sexual harassment as a form of discrimination based on sex. Soon after, MacKinnon’s framework was used in Alexander v. Yale, putting forth the legal argument that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination prohibited under Title IX. While the case was dismissed, it resulted in educational institutions establishing grievance procedures for sexual harassment. Generations of student activists have subsequently advocated for programs to prevent and address sexual violence and harassment in educational institutions across the U.S.
In 2015, Gavin Grimm, a transgender student, sued his school board, alleging its policy of prohibiting him from using the boys' bathroom violated Title IX and the equal protection clause of the Constitution. A federal judge in Virginia ruled in his favor in 2018. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the ruling in his favor in August 2020.
In addition to sexual harassment, the scope of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX includes discrimination based on:
gender identity (including the protection of transgender and non-binary people from discrimination)
Title IX regulations were most recently amended in 2020, under the previous administration. UC opposed many of the regulations issued at that time.
In 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14021 – Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free From Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity, prompting a comprehensive review of the 2020 amendments.
On June 23, 2022, the federal Department of Education (DOE) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Title IX. DOE released proposed changes to the regulations for public comment. As the UC Office of the President said in a statement, “the proposed rules represent a great improvement over the regulations issued by the previous administration in 2020.”
Until the Title IX regulations are amended, the 2020 regulations are still in place. Please refer to the updated Title IX Q&A document for more information

"Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome." (Marin Health & Human Services)
Due to societal inequalities and other factors, different individuals need different resources or opportunities to be able to access educational programs.
"The concept of intersectionality, coined by Professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, describes the ways in which systems of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, class and other forms of discrimination 'intersect' to create unique dynamics and effects." (Center for Intersectional Justice)
Each person holds multiple identities at the same time, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, class, language, and culture.
Inequalities are all interconnected. An individual can also experience multiple forms of discrimination or harassment at the same time.

President Joe Biden said that signing legislation into law on Thursday establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States – will go down as “one of the greatest honors” of his presidency.
“I have to say to you, I’ve only been president for several months, but I think this will go down, for me, as one of the greatest honors I will have as president,” Biden said at the White House during a signing ceremony.
“I regret that my grandchildren aren’t here, because this is a really, really, really important moment in our history. By making Juneteenth a federal holiday, all Americans can feel the power of this day and learn from our history – and celebrate progress and grapple with the distance we’ve come (and) the distance we have to travel,” Biden said.
The ceremony, which took place in the East Room, included some 80 members of Congress – including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, local elected officials, community leaders and activists. The President specifically noted that Opal Lee, the activist who campaigned to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday, was in attendance.
Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Only a handful of states currently observe Juneteenth as a paid holiday.
Biden, speaking at the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, repeated the sentiments he relayed when he commemorated the Tulsa race massacre earlier this year, that “great nations don’t ignore their most painful moments.”

“They embrace them. Great nations don’t walk away. We’ve come to terms with the mistakes we made and in remembering those moments, we begin to heal and grow stronger,” the President said.
During the ceremony, the President said it was not enough to commemorate the holiday, but to use it as a day of reflection and action.
“We can’t rest until the promise of equality if fulfilled for every one of us in every corner of this nation. That to me is the meaning of Juneteenth,” Biden said.
Biden also underscored how his White House agenda is working to deliver equality and emphasized that the promise of equality is not going to fulfilled “so long as the sacred right to vote remains under attack.” The President specifically pointed to restrictive voter laws in some states, calling them “an assault that offends our very democracy.”
The holiday is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the eleventh federal holiday recognized by the US federal government. The US Office of Personnel Management announced Thursday that most federal employees will observe the holiday on Friday since Juneteenth falls on a Saturday this year.
The legislation, which was passed by Congress on Wednesday, gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd last year. It was also spurred after Democrats won the White House and control of the House of Representatives and the US Senate.
The bill passed the House on Wednesday with a 415-14 vote after the Senate unanimously passed the legislation the day before.
The bill had bipartisan sponsors that included Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts.

'Eyes on the prize': Two activists set aside personal threats to fight new voting restrictions
At the White House on Thursday, Biden lauded members of Congress for the bipartisan effort, saying, “I hope this is the beginning of a change in the way we deal with one another.”
Lee told reporters ahead of the final passage of the bill, “what I see here today is racial divide crumbling, being crushed this day under a momentous vote that brings together people who understand the value of freedom.”
The 14 Republicans who voted against the bill were Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin, Doug LaMalfa of California, Tom McClintock of California, Mike Rogers of Alabama, Matt Rosendale of Montana, Ronny Jackson of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Chip Roy of Texas and Paul Gosar of Arizona.
Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson had previously blocked the bill in 2020, saying that the day off for federal employees would cost US taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. But Johnson dropped his objection this week despite his concerns, which paved the way for the bill’s passage in the Senate.
