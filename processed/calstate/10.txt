Title IX Laws:Discrimination and Harassment - Know Your Rights
Title IX is a federal law that was passed in 1972 to ensure that male and female students and employees in educational settings are treated equally and fairly. It protects against discrimination based on sex (including sexual harassment). In addition, Title IX protects transgender students and students who do not conform to gender stereotypes. State law also prohibits discrimination based on gender (sex), gender expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
Our County Office of Education and the Title IX Coordinator are aware of and acknowledge the new Title IX regulations released on May 6, 2020 and effective as of August 14, 2020.  Our Title IX team will be receiving training on these new regulations in the near future, and will make our training materials available online for review.  We are in the process of reviewing and revising our Title IX policy and practices, which involves hearing from our stake-holders in order to implement a fair, thorough, and impartial Title IX complaint process and COE response.
Federal Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), implemented at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31, subd. (a), provides that no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a recipient which receives federal financial assistance. Title IX requires school districts to take immediate and appropriate action to investigate when it knows or reasonably should know of a possible Title IX violation.
