Confidential Advocacy and Support
UT Austin provides two private support programs for students who have been impacted by interpersonal violence that are not mandated to make a report to the university: Confidential Advocates and the Interpersonal Violence Peer Support Program.
We empower students by providing information, tools, and resources and by allowing students to determine the course of action that best fits their needs. Students may share as much or as little as they feel comfortable. Services include, but are not limited to:
Offering a safer setting for emotional support and to discuss questions, concerns, and experiences regarding an incident of interpersonal violence
Providing information about students' rights regarding the Title IX reporting and investigation process
Exploring academic, housing, medical, and or/financial accommodations and remedies
Referrals for on- and off-campus resources
