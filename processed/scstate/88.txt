(B) The terms of the members are for four years and until their successors are appointed and qualify, except of those first appointed. When making the initial appointments, the Superintendent of Education shall designate half of his appointments to serve two-year terms only.
(C) Vacancies for any reason must be filled in the manner of the original appointment for the unexpired term. No member shall serve more than two terms or eight years, whichever is longer. Members who miss more than three consecutive meetings without excuse or members who resign must be replaced in the same manner as their predecessor. Members may be paid per diem, mileage, and subsistence as established by the board not to exceed standards provided by law for boards, committees, and commissions. A complete report of the activities of the Financial Literacy Board of Trustees must be made annually to the General Assembly and the State Auditor.
(1) develop a comprehensive long-range initiative for improving the financial literacy of students in kindergarten through twelfth grade;
(2) promulgate regulations, establish guidelines, policies, and procedures for implementation of the South Carolina Financial Literacy Initiative;
(3) provide oversight on the implementation of the South Carolina Financial Literacy Initiative at the state and school district levels;
(6) assess and develop recommendations for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of financial literacy programs and funding and other programs and funding sources, as allowable, as necessary to carry out the Financial Literacy Initiative, including additional fiscal strategies, redeployment of state resources, and development of new programs;
(7) establish results-oriented measures and objectives and assess whether services provided are meeting the goals and achieving the results established for the Financial Literacy Initiative;
(9) report annually to the General Assembly by January first on activities and progress to include recommendations for changes and legislative initiatives and results of program evaluations.
The South Carolina Financial Literacy Board of Trustees may employ, by a majority vote, a Director of the Financial Literacy Office and other staff as necessary to carry out the South Carolina Financial Literacy Initiative and other duties and responsibilities as assigned by the board. The director, with the approval of the board, may hire staff necessary to carry out the provisions of the initiative.
(A) No state funds may be used to support or operate the Financial Literacy Initiative. This prohibition does not prevent the Department of Education from housing the offices of the Financial Literacy Initiative. A separate fund must be established to accept nongovernmental grants, gifts, and donations from a public or private source for the South Carolina Financial Literacy Trust. All funds may be carried forward from fiscal year to fiscal year. The State Treasurer shall invest the monies in the Financial Literacy Trust in the same manner as other funds under his control are invested and all interest derived from the investment of these funds shall remain in the trust. The South Carolina Financial Literacy Board of Trustees shall administer and authorize any disbursements from the trust. Private individuals and groups shall be encouraged to contribute to this endeavor.
(4) submit an annual report to the board by December first, which includes, but is not limited to, the statewide needs and resources available to meet the goals and purposes of the Financial Literacy Initiative, the ongoing progress and results of the Financial Literacy Initiative, fiscal information on the expenditure of funds, and recommendations and legislative proposals to further implement the South Carolina Financial Literacy Initiative;
(5) provide for on-going data collection and contract for an in-depth performance audit due January 1, 2010, and every three years thereafter, to ensure that statewide goals and requirements of the Financial Literacy Initiative are being met; and
(6) coordinate the Financial Literacy Initiative with all other state, federal, and local public and private efforts to promote and improve financial literacy.
(A) To obtain a grant, a school district shall submit an application to the Financial Literacy Office in a format specified by the Financial Literacy Board of Trustees. The application shall include, as appropriate to the level of grant applied for, the level of funding requested, a description of needs of the school, assets and resources available, and the proposed strategies to address needs as they relate to the goals of the Financial Literacy Initiative.
(B) The allocations for the grants must take into consideration the quality of the grant proposal; the percentage of students who are eligible for the free and reduced price lunch program; and average per capita income. The criteria also must take into account the standing of the geographical area in relation to the statewide Kids Count indicators.
Grants provided to school districts must be used to address the financial literacy needs of students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. Grant funds may not supplant current expenditures by counties or state agencies for financial literacy, and may not be used where other state or federal funding sources are available or could be made available. In awarding grants, every effort must be made to ensure that all geographic areas of the State are represented.
To ensure effective use of funds and with the approval of the Financial Literacy Office, awards may be carried forward and used in the following fiscal year. Funds appropriated to the Financial Literacy Trust also may be carried forward into subsequent years.
(B) Disbursements may be made only on the written authorization of the individual designated by the school district and only for the purposes specified. A person violating this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined five thousand dollars or imprisoned for six months, or both.
(A) The Financial Literacy Board of Trustees shall establish internal evaluation policies and procedures for an annual review of the implementation of strategies and progress toward the interim goals and benchmarks. In instances where no progress has been made, the Financial Literacy Board shall provide targeted assistance or the board may terminate the grant. In addition, a program evaluation of the Financial Literacy Initiatives at the state and local levels must be conducted every three years by an independent, external evaluator under contract with the Financial Literacy Board of Trustees. However, the selected evaluator must be approved, and the evaluation overseen, by a committee consisting of three members, one appointed by the Financial Literacy Board, one appointed by the Chairman of the Senate Education Committee, and one appointed by the Chairman of the House Education and Public Works Committee. These committee members must be professionally recognized as proficient in accounting, finance, banking, tax, insurance, or a closely related field. The first report must be provided no later than January 1, 2010.
(B) Grantees shall agree to participate in an evaluation in order to receive a Financial Literacy grant. Subsequent grant approval and grant allocations must be dependent, in part, on the results of the evaluations. If an evaluation finds no progress has been made in meeting goals or implementing strategies as agreed to in the grant, the grant must be terminated.
(C) The purpose of the evaluation is to assess progress toward achieving the Financial Literacy goals and to determine the impact of the initiative on students at the state and local levels. The impact assessment shall include, but is not limited to, end-of-course evaluations and projects. During the course of the evaluation, if an evaluator determines that a state agency has failed to comply with the coordination and collaboration provisions as required in this chapter, the final report must reflect that information. Program evaluation reports must be reported to the General Assembly no later than three months after conclusion of the evaluation.
