Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title IX, Part A McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act
Title IX, Part A McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney-Vento) is authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. McKinney-Vento ensures that students who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence due to loss of housing due to economic hardship or a similar reason are provided a free, public education. McKinney-Vento Act ensures the educational rights and protection for children and youth experiencing homelessness and includes:
The right to immediate enrollment in school even without giving a permanent address
The right to attend school and fully participate in school activities in the school of origin, or in the school in the attendance area where the family or youth is currently residing
The right to receive transportation to and from the school of origin
The right to services comparable to those received by housed schoolmates
The right to attend school along with children not experiencing homelessness
The SCDE program office provides training, technical assistance, and monitoring, as well as federal funding through a competitive grant process to support school district McKinney-Vento programs. South Carolina school districts identified 11,906 McKinney-Vento students during the 2020�21 academic year. Every school district is required to have a McKinney-Vento liaison to identify and assist students and their families with enrollment.

There are many common questions about children and youth who are experiencing homelessness. We have complied relevant documents that have answered some of the questions we hear the most.
The following documents will provide information and resources to improve identification and assist schools with identifying children and youth experiencing homelessness.
School professionals can acquire specific knowledge regarding serving McKinney-Vento students, as well as, build coalitions to help strengthen resiliency in this population of youth.
The purpose of the Enrollment Survey (ES) is to consolidate identification tools for the three federal programs housed within the Diversity, Inclusion, and Access (DIA) team including the McKinney-Vento Education of Homeless Children and Youth, Title I, Part C Migrant Education, and Title III, Part A Multilingual Learners and Immigrant Children and Youth. Identification of our diverse student subgroups is an imperative first step to increasing access to educational opportunities and providing appropriate services and wrap-around supports. In addition, consolidation of identification tools will streamline identification processes and data entry for DIA federal programs.
Parents and Caregivers can acquire specific knowledge regarding McKinney-Vento rights and programs available to them as they navigate how to receive services. A multi-tiered approach is the best way to minimize the impact from this transitional period.
The McKinney-Vento Act guarantees educational rights and support for students experiencing homelessness, this includes specific support for unaccompanied youth.
McKinney-Vento students should be afforded the right to pursue graduation and post-secondary options. �Due to the nature of their situation, students can qualify for services and resources to assist with this transition.
SC Report Card Data: The Report Card website provides information on South Carolina's school districts, including school ratings and other useful information such as school safety, classroom environment, graduation rate, student academic progress, and college and career readiness and additional academic information. Chronic Absenteeism can be found in the School Climate section.
Community resources and connections are important for vulnerable students and their families. South Carolina has multiple organizations that seek to assist families as they navigate school and life through this time of transition.
South Carolina Food Access Map: South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) and Clemson University created a statewide food access map with over 850 food pantries and other food resources. The map also includes contact information for Department of Social Services, SCDHEC Offices, and United Way locations for all 46 counties.

ED Data Express provides public access to the funding, participation, and performance data from school years starting from 2010-2011 onward on formula grant programs administered in the�Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. Most of the data are collected by school year and updated annually as the data become available.
The Educators dashboard is created by using teacher data from three Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) programs:
Title I, Part A provides financial assistance to local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families;
Title II provides grants to State educational agencies and subgrants to LEAs to increase the number of and improve the quality and effectiveness of teachers, principals, and other school leaders;
Title III provides grants to SEAs to ensure that English learners achieve at high levels in academic subjects and assists teachers, principals, and other school leaders to establish and implement effective language instruction educational programs.
The McKinney-Vento program is designed to address the problems that homeless children and youth have faced in enrolling, attending, and succeeding in school. Under this program, State educational agencies (SEAs) must ensure that each homeless child and youth has equal access to the same free, appropriate public education, including a public preschool education, as other children and youth. Homeless children and youth should have access to the educational and other services that they need to enable them to meet the same challenging State student academic achievement standards to which all students are held. In addition, homeless students may not be separated from the mainstream school environment. States and districts are required to review and undertake steps to revise laws, regulations, practices, or policies that may act as a barrier to the enrollment, attendance, or success in school of homeless children and youth.
Part B of Title V of the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) contains Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) initiatives that are designed to help rural districts that may lack the personnel and resources to compete effectively for Federal competitive grants and that often receive grant allocations in amounts that are too small to be effective in meeting their intended purposes. The two initiatives within the Rural Education Achievement Program are (1) the Small, Rural School Achievement program (SRSA) and (2) the Rural and Low-Income School Program (RLIS).
Title I, Part A provides financial assistance to local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards. Federal funds are currently allocated through four statutory formulas that are based primarily on census poverty estimates and the cost of education in each state.
Title I, Part C Funds support high quality education programs for migratory children and help ensure that migratory children who move among the states are not penalized in any manner by disparities among states in curriculum, graduation requirements, or state academic content and student academic achievement standards. Funds also ensure that migratory children not only are provided with appropriate education services (including supportive services) that address their special needs but also that such children receive full and appropriate opportunities to meet the same challenging state academic content and student academic achievement standards that all children are expected to meet. Federal funds are allocated by formula to SEAs, based on each state's per pupil expenditure for education and counts of eligible migratory children, age 3 through 21, residing within the state.
The Part D, Subpart 1, State Agency Neglected and Delinquent (N and D) program provides formula grants to SEAs for supplementary education services to help provide education continuity for children and youths in state-run institutions for juveniles and in adult correctional institutions so that these youths can make successful transitions to school or employment once they are released. Funds are allocated by formula to SEAs, which make subgrants to the state agencies responsible for educating neglected or delinquent children and youths. To be eligible for state N and D funds, juvenile institutions must provide 20 hours a week of instruction from nonfederal funds; adult correctional institutions must provide 15 hours. The Subpart 2 Local Education Agency Program requires each SEA to reserve from its Title I, Part A, allocation, funds generated by the number of children in locally operated institutions for delinquent youths. Funds are awarded to LEAs with high proportions of youths in local correctional facilities to support dropout prevention programs for at-risk youths.

Funds are awarded to LEAs with high proportions of youths in local correctional facilities to support dropout prevention programs for at-risk youths.
Title II, Part A (Title II-A) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) is the key statute through which the federal government provides funds to states and districts to improve the quality and effectiveness of their teachers, principals, and other school leaders.
This program is designed to improve the education of limited English proficient (LEP) children and youths by helping them learn English and meet challenging state academic content and student academic achievement standards. The program provides enhanced instructional opportunities for immigrant children and youths. Funds are distributed to states based on a formula that takes into account the number of immigrant and LEP students in each state.
Our mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.
