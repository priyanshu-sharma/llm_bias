Welcome to the South Carolina Sex Offender Registry!  South Carolina has moved to a new sex offender management application called SORT.  SORT is provided at no charge by the U.S. Department of Justice to the State of South Carolina.  SORT is designed to make the sex offender registry process as efficient and effective as possible.  This streamlined process also provides improved information sharing across all jurisdictions.  SORT provides community notifications and automatic updates to the National Sex Offender Public Web Site.  Other features include multiple photographs of the offender over time, a visual map of where the offender lives, a list of aliases the offender has used in the past, and a list of all of the sexually related offenses that an offender has been convicted of committing.
Signing up for SORT Notifications!  Citizens who were signed up on the previous system must register anew with SORT.  This registration process is simple and can be done by agreeing to the “Conditions of Use” at the bottom of this page. On the next page, enter the code that appears on the page and click on “Continue”. On the next page, click on the “Community Notifications” link. Enter all of the information under the “Register for Community Notifications” section " and agree to the “Agreement Terms”
