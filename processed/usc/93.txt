The Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive
Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Action item No. 3, from the president’s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the president’s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,
policies, training, communications, historic activity, capacity and effectiveness.

Investigator, Decision Maker, and Appeals Officer Training Introduction
The Title IX Task Force was charged by former President Caslen to critically evaluate
the institution’s effectiveness in addressing sexual harassment and violence (SHV)
and to offer recommendations to enhance the institution’s effectiveness in addressing
Guided by principles of respect, accountability, and empowerment, the Task Force believes
that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve processes to support the needs of
both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings point to several
such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the
diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community safe each day.
The annual rate of reported cases of SHV was fairly stable, relative to the growth
in the institution’s size. The rates are lower than estimated national rates of SHV.
Most complaints concerned students against other students. Incidents involving faculty
respondents and student complaints were relatively rare.
Training for stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, managers) and for implementers
(staff providing SHV services) are all lacking in frequency and customized content.
Of note is the need for specialized training for professionals directly involved in
addressing SHV and managers of employees involved in cases of SHV.
The current reporting system is difficult to navigate, and the process of reporting
is an adverse and potentially re-traumatizing experience, creating significant barriers
Few reported cases are formally investigated, with a large proportion of complainants
opting out. Further, cases against faculty are less likely to result in a reasonable
cause finding than those against student and staff.
There is no faculty-governed process for disciplinary action short of termination
for faculty. Further, there is inconsistency in documentation and execution of discipline
for faculty and staff. There is a lack of guidelines regarding handling conduct that
falls short of policy violation but is nonetheless inappropriate.
There is a lack of continual review of risk to the complainant, which may undermine
measures to protect against further harassment and retaliation. While support is offered
to student respondents through the Respondent Resource Committee, in practice, few
student respondents utilize these services.
Staffing, job scope, reporting structures, and coordinating mechanisms require attention.
There is a lack of centralized information management and public reporting. The culture
of the institution and students does not reflect a shared commitment to addressing
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
effectively to SHV. Specifically we recommend:
Increase the frequency and tracking of training and education activities and expand
Improve both complainant and respondent experiences through the reporting and investigating
process by reviewing all websites, forms and communications to be more user-friendly,
interpersonally sensitive and non-threatening to both complainant and respondent.
Develop and maintain investigative protocols and rubrics for evaluations of cases.
Document cases in a manner that is consistent with protocols and rubrics. Review cases
to assure adherence to policy, protocols and rubrics.
Create a system to assure that the disciplinary actions are consistently delivered.
Create guidelines for corrective action and monitoring of inappropriate behavior that
falls short of policy violation. Develop procedures for consistent, thorough and centralized
record keeping of disciplinary and corrective action. Revise the Faculty Manual and/or
policy to address faculty misconduct and discipline.
Develop trauma-informed first responder protocols to ensure that no matter which reporting
office receives the report, the complainant receives consistent information about
support services and reporting options. Continually assess ongoing risk to complainants
and revise supportive measures accordingly.
Evaluate the organization structure to maximize effectiveness with particular attention
to deputy Title IX coordinator role, the coordination between academic units and the
SHV offices, and the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) line of reporting.
Consolidate information management and annual reporting. Work toward a culture of
The work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university community’s
response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide further clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report

Initially announced on March 15, 2021 and then formally launched on March 26, the
Title IX Task Force is an interdisciplinary team of students, faculty and staff formed
to undertake a comprehensive review of processes, policies, communications, training
and historic activity, and determine institutional capacity and effectiveness to support
the safety of the community and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment or
In the two months that followed, the 15 Task Force members – under the leadership of Dr. Kirsten Kennedy, associate vice president for Housing
and Sustainability and Dr. Audrey Korsgaard, chair-elect of the Faculty Senate and
professor of Management and director of the Riegel and Emory Human Resources Center
at the Darla Moore School of Business – reviewed policies, studied procedures, tracked
training, studied existing education and programs, interviewed subject matter experts,
and considered resourcing levels currently in use across the university. With support
from the nationally recognized team from Cozen O’Connor’s Institutional Response Group,
the final report of the Task Force identifies areas for further review and offers
insight into ways the university can improve the campus safety environment and create
an ecosystem of care for those impacted by interpersonal violence.
Simultaneous to the Task Force process, the Board of Trustees tasked Audit and Advisory
Services with the responsibility to review select historic cases and determine compliance
with applicable policies, regulations and laws in place to govern Title IX activity.
The report, titled "Title IX Process Review for Select Cases," was issued to the Board
View the Audit and Advisory Services Report »
While the work of the Audit and Advisory Services team found university policies and
procedures met the appropriate national standards and requirements that govern the
university’s work in this area, the Task Force recognizes those standards create a
threshold of compliance, and believes that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve
upon processes for continuous review and strengthening of systems that balance and
support the needs of both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings
point to several such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution
has made and the diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
Finally, the work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university
community’s response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report
serves to guide the work of the Implementation Group and Cozen O’Connor who will continue
to work with members of the Task Force and key university leaders to further develop
Both the Task Force Report and the Audit and Advisory Services Report were released
in a letter from Interim President Harris Pastides to all students, faculty and staff on July 1, 2021.
With the findings of both the Audit and Advisory Services case review and the Task
Force report serving as the foundation for understanding, the university has assembled
an implementation group charged by Interim President Harris Pastides with the responsibility to quickly develop
and implement the actions necessary to improve the university’s response to issues
related to Title IX and interpersonal violence. The group is co-led by Dr. Stacy Fritz

The Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive
Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Action item No. 3, from the president’s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the president’s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,
policies, training, communications, historic activity, capacity and effectiveness.

to sexual misconduct. The review will include but not be limited to recommendations

The Title IX Task Force was charged by former President Caslen to critically evaluate
the institution’s effectiveness in addressing sexual harassment and violence (SHV)
and to offer recommendations to enhance the institution’s effectiveness in addressing
Guided by principles of respect, accountability, and empowerment, the Task Force believes
that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve processes to support the needs of
both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings point to several
such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the
diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community safe each day.
The annual rate of reported cases of SHV was fairly stable, relative to the growth
in the institution’s size. The rates are lower than estimated national rates of SHV.
Most complaints concerned students against other students. Incidents involving faculty
respondents and student complaints were relatively rare.
Training for stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, managers) and for implementers
(staff providing SHV services) are all lacking in frequency and customized content.
Of note is the need for specialized training for professionals directly involved in
addressing SHV and managers of employees involved in cases of SHV.
The current reporting system is difficult to navigate, and the process of reporting
is an adverse and potentially re-traumatizing experience, creating significant barriers
Few reported cases are formally investigated, with a large proportion of complainants
opting out. Further, cases against faculty are less likely to result in a reasonable
cause finding than those against student and staff.
There is no faculty-governed process for disciplinary action short of termination
for faculty. Further, there is inconsistency in documentation and execution of discipline
for faculty and staff. There is a lack of guidelines regarding handling conduct that
falls short of policy violation but is nonetheless inappropriate.
There is a lack of continual review of risk to the complainant, which may undermine
measures to protect against further harassment and retaliation. While support is offered
to student respondents through the Respondent Resource Committee, in practice, few
student respondents utilize these services.
Staffing, job scope, reporting structures, and coordinating mechanisms require attention.
There is a lack of centralized information management and public reporting. The culture
of the institution and students does not reflect a shared commitment to addressing
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants

all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
effectively to SHV. Specifically we recommend:
Increase the frequency and tracking of training and education activities and expand
Improve both complainant and respondent experiences through the reporting and investigating
process by reviewing all websites, forms and communications to be more user-friendly,
interpersonally sensitive and non-threatening to both complainant and respondent.
Develop and maintain investigative protocols and rubrics for evaluations of cases.
Document cases in a manner that is consistent with protocols and rubrics. Review cases
to assure adherence to policy, protocols and rubrics.
Create a system to assure that the disciplinary actions are consistently delivered.
Create guidelines for corrective action and monitoring of inappropriate behavior that
falls short of policy violation. Develop procedures for consistent, thorough and centralized
record keeping of disciplinary and corrective action. Revise the Faculty Manual and/or
policy to address faculty misconduct and discipline.
Develop trauma-informed first responder protocols to ensure that no matter which reporting
office receives the report, the complainant receives consistent information about
support services and reporting options. Continually assess ongoing risk to complainants
and revise supportive measures accordingly.
Evaluate the organization structure to maximize effectiveness with particular attention
to deputy Title IX coordinator role, the coordination between academic units and the
SHV offices, and the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) line of reporting.
Consolidate information management and annual reporting. Work toward a culture of
