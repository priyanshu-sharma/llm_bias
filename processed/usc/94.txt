The University of South Carolina recognizes that a welcoming, supportive environment

Expand all1. Federal law prohibits sex discrimination (which includes discrimination based on
pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions).
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits sex discrimination
in any educational program or activity that receives federal funds. This includes
the University of South Carolina. Title IX is found in the United States Code at Title
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...
Title IX also prohibits discrimination against pregnant or parenting students participating
in such programs or activities. Specifically, Part 106.40 of Title 34 of the Code
A recipient [of federal funds, such as the University of South Carolina] shall not
apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital
status which treats students differently on the basis of sex.
The regulations make clear that there are certain actions colleges and universities
receiving federal funds cannot take, and that there are certain actions that colleges
The University of South Carolina cannot discriminate against any student because of
the student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or
The University of South Carolina cannot exclude any student from its education programs
or activities because of the student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination
of pregnancy or recovery from any of these conditions, unless the student requests
voluntarily to participate in a separate or special portion of any program or activity.
The University of South Carolina cannot require a doctor to certify a pregnant student
is physically and emotionally able to continue participation in a program or activity,
unless such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional
conditions requiring the attention of a doctor. This means the university cannot treat
pregnant students differently from other students being treated by doctors, even when
pregnant students are in the later stages of pregnancy.
Even though colleges and universities should not presume pregnant students are unable
to attend school or participate in school activities, this does not mean that a college
or university that receives federal funds may not be required to provide accommodations
for pregnant students to allow them to attend school.
To ensure a pregnant student’s access to its educational programs or activities, when
necessary, a school must make adjustments to its regular programs that are reasonable
and responsive to the student’s temporary pregnancy status. For example, a school
may be required to provide a larger desk, allow frequent or longer bathroom breaks,
or make other reasonable accommodations.
A college or university that receives federal funds must treat pregnancy, childbirth,
false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from any of these conditions
the same as it treats any other temporary disability regarding any medical or hospital
benefit, service, plan or policy which the college or university offers or operates
for students admitted to its educational program or activity.
The University of South Carolina must treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy,
termination of pregnancy and recovery from any of these conditions as an excused absence
for the period of time deemed medically necessary by the student's physician. At the
conclusion of that period of absence, the university must reinstate the student to
the status which she held when the leave began.
This “reinstatement” should include giving the student the opportunity to make up
any work that was missed. The university may offer the student alternatives to making
up missed work. This may involve allowing the student to repeat or retake a course
or allowing the student additional time in a program to continue at the same pace
and finish at a later date, especially after longer periods of leave. This should
involve an interactive process between the student and the instructor.
However, in considering requests for accommodations, the university is not required
to grant an accommodation that would fundamentally alter any university program or
activity, or that would constitute an undue financial or administrative burden on
In addition to the above requirements of Title IX, harassing a student because of
pregnancy may violate Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination. Harassing
conduct can take many forms, including verbal (oral) as well as graphic and physical

2. University policy prohibits sex discrimination (which includes discrimination based
on pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions).
Discrimination or harassment based on age, ancestry, citizenship status, color, disability,
ethnicity, familial status, gender (including transgender), gender identity or expression,
genetic information, HIV/AIDs status, military status, national origin, pregnancy
(false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, childbirth, recovery therefrom or related
medical conditions, breastfeeding), race, religion (including religious dress and
grooming practices), sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other bases under
federal, state, local law, or regulations is prohibited.
