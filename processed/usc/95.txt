with applicable policies, regulations and laws in place to govern Title IX activity.
The report, titled "Title IX Process Review for Select Cases," was issued to the Board
While the work of the Audit and Advisory Services team found university policies and
procedures met the appropriate national standards and requirements that govern the
university�s work in this area, the Task Force recognizes those standards create a
threshold of compliance, and believes that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve

support the needs of both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force�s findings
point to several such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution
has made and the diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force�s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force�s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
Finally, the work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university
community�s response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report
serves to guide the work of the Implementation Group and Cozen O�Connor who will continue

Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Action item No. 3, from the president�s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the president�s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,
policies, training, communications, historic activity, capacity and effectiveness.
At the conclusion of the review period, the team will recommend to the president and
the cabinet sustainable long-term approaches, action steps, structure and funding
requirements intended to improve the institution�s ability to prevent and respond
to sexual misconduct. The review will include but not be limited to recommendations

such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the
