May 13, 2020 - A letter from Dr. Susan Buskirk, the University's Chief Accountability Officer concerning the updates to Title IX regulations going into effect on August 14, 2020.
The University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) has partnered with Student Success to provide the “Not Anymore” Primary Prevention Program. "Not Anymore" is an interactive online program designed to educate about the prevention of sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, and stalking.
UMB equal access training is required for all UMB employees, students, and affiliates! Access the appropriate link at www.umaryland.edu/titleix/training.
Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.

Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.

Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.

Recovering from a sexual assault or abuse is a process, and that process looks different for everyone. It may take weeks, months, or years—there’s no timetable for healing. Below you’ll find some resources to help you navigate the process.
For SurvivorsHow Can Therapy Help? - If you decide to seek support from a therapist after sexual assault or abuse, you may have some questions. That’s perfectly normal. Working with a therapist can help you deal with some of the challenges you may be facing.
Telling Loved Ones About Sexual Assault - It can be hard to talk about an experience with sexual violence, and sometimes it may feel most daunting to bring it up with people you are closest to. Here are a few questions you may want to ask yourself before telling someone, tips to help prepare for the conversation, and ways to cope with unhelpful reactions if they occur.
Self-Care After Trauma - Whether it happened recently or years ago, self care can help you cope with the short- and long-term effects of a trauma like sexual assault.
Tips for Survivors on Consuming Media - Movies and TV shows that show sexual assault, incest, and child sexual abuse can be very difficult for survivors to watch.
Airport Security for Survivors - Airport security can be stressful for any traveler, but for some survivors of sexual assault the security screening process is a little more sensitive.
For Loved OnesTips for Talking with Survivors of Sexual Assault - It’s not always easy to know what to say when someone tells you they’ve been sexually assaulted, especially if they are a friend or family member.

Self-Care for Friends and Family - There is no normal or "right" way to react when you find out that someone you care about has survived an act of sexual violence. Regardless of what you’re feeling, these emotions can be intense and difficult to deal with.
Help for Parents of Children Who Have Been Sexually Abused by Family Members - It’s important to find a way to manage your feelings, so you can focus on creating a safe environment for your child that is free from harm, judgment, and blame.
