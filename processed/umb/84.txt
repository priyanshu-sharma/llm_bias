Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the�University�s non-discrimination policies,�and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.� Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about�University policies �regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University�s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
