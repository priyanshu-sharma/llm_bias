A message from Dr. Roger J. Ward, the University's Chief Accountability Officer
Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
Thank you for helping to make our campus a harassment-free environment.

Report Other Forms of Discrimination/Harassment
UMB does not tolerate discrimination in any form. All discrimination should be reported promptly. Use the Hotline Form to report any discrimination/harassment involving employees, faculty, staff, students, applicants, and third parties. Reports will be forwarded to the appropriate UMB staff member(s) in accordance with UMB's Nondiscrimination Policies:
Information will be kept as private to the fullest extent possible and will be disclosed only to those individuals who need to know in order to investigate and resolve the complaint, and/or as required by law.
For Sexual Misconduct/Prohibited Sex Discrimination: Responsible employees should complete the Hotline Form in full. The target of the alleged incident may request partial or complete confidentiality below. A request for confidentiality may limit the University’s ability to respond to the complaint. The University will take reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with that request, as long as doing so does not prevent the University from responding effectively to and preventing prohibited sex discrimination that may be directed toward others.
When reporting sexual misconduct or harassment, choose the Bias & Discrimination category on the Hotline Reporting Page.
