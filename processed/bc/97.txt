Benedict College also prohibits retaliation against any person opposing discrimination or participating in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the College.  Sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking are forms of sex discrimination, which are prohibited under Title IX and by Benedict College policy.
Any member of the campus community, guest, or visitor who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational, employment, residential, or social access, opportunities and/or benefits of any member of the Benedict College community on the basis of sex is in violation of the Policy and Procedures on Sexual Discrimination and Misconduct.

About the President Strategic Plan Benedict College Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP)
Students receiving federal Title IV financial aid, who do not pass any courses and who do not officially withdraw from the College are considered “unofficially withdrawn.” The following procedures are used to determine if students never attend class and/or withdraw unofficially, and to determine repayments due back to aid programs.At the end of each semester, a report is generated of all students who have Title IV federal aid and who have a semester GPA of 0.00. Those students who have all “F‘s” are assumed to be ‘unofficially withdrawn’.The last date of attendance as reported by any of the instructors is determined and used in the Return of Title IV Funds calculation.If a last day of attendance cannot otherwise be determined, the student is assumed to have attended 50% of the enrollment period and the formula is calculated based on that length of attendance.

This Web page describes the practices of Benedict College with respect to the collection of user information from this website and the use and disclosure of such information.This document only applies to this website and does not address the information we obtain from places other than our website. In addition, other Benedict College and/or other sites on the Web (including those we link to) have their own practices; in all cases we encourage you to ask questions and to provide data only to sites whose practices you understand and trust.
If you browse this website, you may generally do so anonymously without providing any personal information. However, there are cases in which we may ask you for personal data. We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address or most-recently visited URL. However, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, such as by filling out a form or survey, entering a contest or sweepstakes, registering your email address with us or emailing us.We do not wish to obtain personally identifiable information from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personally identifiable information.Benedict College reserves the right to use information collected within our website for our business purposes. If you provide us with information such as telephone number, mailing address, or email address, we may contact you via the provided medium.We do not make available any information that we collect from you to any organizations or companies other than our affiliates.
Personal information provided to us may be used for marketing and promotional purposes only by Benedict College. Except as described in this policy, Benedict College does not rent, sell or otherwise distribute to third parties, your personal information entered on this site without your consent, unless required by law or as disclosed to you when the information is collected. If you do provide us with consent to share your information with other third party companies, we may share your information with third party companies who offer products and services that may be of interest to you. These companies may then contact you directly with product or sample offers, personalized offers and information, or to ask for your feedback on products and programs that they think may be of interest to you.We may share your personal information with our third party service providers on a need-to-know basis. We engage third party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf. In order to perform those services, the service providers may need to know your personal information. We require that they protect this information and only use it to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may use outside shipping companies, credit card processing companies, resellers, distributors and content providers.
We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our “firewall” in a secure location, and we often restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data. Of course, there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet. Further, please note that a third-party Web host, whose actions we do not control, operates our servers.Amendments to this policy will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted.
On some of the pages on its website, Benedict College may use cookies to help provide you with a better, faster, and more personalized experience. A cookie is a small text file that a website that you view can place on your computer or other device. Through them and other similar technologies, information can be collected and stored about your online activities. They can, for example, store and manage user preferences, deliver targeted advertising, enable your access to certain content, and gather analytic and usage data to help us refine and improve our understanding of your interests and your experience on, and resulting from your visits to, our website. Cookies may be “session” cookies that last for the duration of your Internet browsing session; or they may be “persistent” cookies that remain on your computer and are active whenever you begin a new browsing session, until you delete them.You can manage website cookies in your browser settings, and you always have the choice to change these settings by accepting, rejecting, or deleting cookies. If you choose to change your settings, you may find that certain functions and features will not work as intended on the Services. All browser settings are slightly different, so to manage cookies, you should refer to the relevant settings within your browser. Please click below for detailed information on how to disable and delete cookies in some commonly used browsers:Mozilla Firefox®Microsoft® Internet ExplorerGoogle Chrome™Safari®Cookies may be one of four types. One type is “essential.” These are necessary for you to navigate around a website and to use its features, for example adding items to an online shopping cart. A second type is “performance.” These collect information about how you use the website. Information collected includes, for example, the Internet browsers and operating systems used, the domain name of the website previously visited, the number of visits, average duration of visit, and pages viewed. The information they collect does not identify you personally; it remains aggregated and anonymous. Performance cookies help us to improve our website’s user-friendliness and to enhance your experience. A third type is “functional.” Functional cookies remember choices you have made related to our website (such as your username, your language, your region, and your preferences as to user-customizable aspects of a web page’s appearance, such as text size and fonts) in order to provide enhanced, more personal features. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized, and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. The fourth type is “targeted advertising.” These cookies track your browsing activities and enable advertisers to send to you (that is, to pop-up on your screen) advertising related to things in which your browsing history indicates that you likely have an interest. They can also track and control the number of times you see an ad and so can measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with advertisers. As an example, if you visit a page on our website related to one of our products, you may begin to see pop-up notices related to that or other products in your future Internet browsing. For more information about such interest-based advertising, visit the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s website.If you opt out of interest-based advertising, you may still receive advertising when you visit our website or advertising about our products when you are on other websites, but we will not be using information collected about you so that the advertising that you do see will not be customized to your interests. You can exercise your online advertising choices at http://optout.aboutads.info or by clicking the AdChoices icon in an ad and following the instructions. You may also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) Opt Out Tool and in the EU at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/. Another tool you can use to control advertising on your mobile device is the AppChoices App.Remember, if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again.
We may use 3rd party vendor remarketing tracking cookies, such as Google Ads and Facebook tracking cookies. This means we may continue to show ads to you across the internet. We use remarketing services to advertise on third party websites, including Google Ads and Facebook and Instagram, to previous visitors to our site.

About the President Strategic Plan Benedict College Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP)
Benedict College adheres to all federal, state, and local civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education.  Benedict College does not discriminate in its admissions practices, in its employment practices, or in its educational programs or activities on the basis of age, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, creed, religion, disability, genetic information, national origin, military or veteran status and forbids retaliation against anyone for engaging in protected activity.
This policy extends to all students, employees and applicants for admission and/or employment.  Further, it extends to all programs and activities supported by the College; including but not limited to the College of Extended Learning Services and College sponsored internships.
As a recipient of federal financial assistance for education activities, Benedict College is required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to ensure that all of its education programs and activities do not discriminate on the basis of sex/gender.  Sex includes sex, sex stereotypes, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation and pregnancy or parenting status.
Benedict College also prohibits retaliation against any person opposing discrimination or participating in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the College.  Sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking are forms of sex discrimination, which are prohibited under Title IX and by Benedict College policy.
Any member of the campus community, guest, or visitor who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational, employment, residential, or social access, opportunities and/or benefits of any member of the Benedict College community on the basis of sex is in violation of the Policy and Procedures on Sexual Discrimination and Misconduct.
Any person may report sex discrimination (whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to have experienced the conduct), in person, by mail, by telephone, or by email, using the contact information listed below for the Title IX Coordinator.  A report may be made at any time (including during non-business hours) by contacting Campus Police at 803-253-5400.
Questions regarding Title IX, and/or concerns about noncompliance, should be directed to the Title IX Coordinator.  To view a complete copy of the Title IX Policy contact the Title IX Coordinator.

About the President Strategic Plan Benedict College Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP)
Students receiving federal Title IV financial aid, who do not pass any courses and who do not officially withdraw from the College are considered “unofficially withdrawn.” The following procedures are used to determine if students never attend class and/or withdraw unofficially, and to determine repayments due back to aid programs.At the end of each semester, a report is generated of all students who have Title IV federal aid and who have a semester GPA of 0.00. Those students who have all “F‘s” are assumed to be ‘unofficially withdrawn’.The last date of attendance as reported by any of the instructors is determined and used in the Return of Title IV Funds calculation.If a last day of attendance cannot otherwise be determined, the student is assumed to have attended 50% of the enrollment period and the formula is calculated based on that length of attendance.
