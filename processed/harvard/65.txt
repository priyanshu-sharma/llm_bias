Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972.
This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.
Title IX regulations guide how colleges and universities, including Harvard, must respond to sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct through appropriate grievance procedures, supportive measures, and related policies. At Harvard, our policies and procedures not only follow the requirements of Title IX regulations, but expand beyond them to also address behaviors that we deem inappropriate for members of the Harvard community.

Harvard community members have a right to seek information and support through confidential resources at the University. As you consider the resources available to you, you may have questions about confidentiality. This page explains how resources at Harvard handle your information. We also encourage you to ask about confidentiality and privilege at the start of your conversation with any of Harvard’s resources.
Conversations with these resources are privileged and, absent special circumstances, may not be disclosed without your consent even in a criminal or other external proceeding. Examples include:
These resources are designated by Harvard as confidential and do not need to notify a Title IX Resource Coordinator when they learn about potential incidents of sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct. However, they may be required to reveal information that was shared with them in a criminal or other external proceeding. Examples include:
These resources are employees who protect privacy but must share information with a Title IX Resource Coordinator or the Office for Gender Equity, and otherwise only on a need-to-know basis. Examples include:
Paid Student Employees (when acting as employees of the University)
* Staff with specialized training and expertise in addressing issues of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct, who are positioned to help students, faculty, staff and third parties and who protect privacy and share information only on a need-to-know basis.**This is not an exhaustive list of Responsible Employees. If you have questions, reach out to your local Title IX Resource Coordinator.
