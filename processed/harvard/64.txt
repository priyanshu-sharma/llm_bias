This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
�No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.�
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner.�Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.
Title IX regulations guide how colleges and universities, including Harvard, must respond�to sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct through appropriate grievance procedures, supportive measures, and related policies. At Harvard, our policies and procedures not only follow the requirements of�Title IX regulations, but expand beyond them to also address behaviors that we deem inappropriate for members of the Harvard community.
