Harvard College's Title IX Resource Coordinators work with undergraduate students impacted in any way by sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct – including sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking – to navigate resources, learn about options, and access supportive measures
College Title IX aims to promote a Harvard College free of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct, to educate our community about policy and Title IX compliance, and help impacted students make the most informed decisions possible about their safety and well-being.
Title IX Resource Coordinators partner with students to help you:
College Title IX can be a starting point for College students who have been impacted in any way by sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, or gender-based harassment.
Title IX Resource Coordinators treat information shared with them with the utmost privacy.
Title IX Resource Coordinators share information only a need-to-know basis.
Speaking with a Title IX Resource Coordinator does not automatically trigger an investigation or formal complaint.
Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
Have a question or need to talk to a Title IX Resource Coordinator?
Confidential resources, such as SHARE Counselors, are also always available to provide support and help you decide which options are right for you.

“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.
Title IX regulations guide how colleges and universities, including Harvard, must respond to sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct through appropriate grievance procedures, supportive measures, and related policies. At Harvard, our policies and procedures not only follow the requirements of Title IX regulations, but expand beyond them to also address behaviors that we deem inappropriate for members of the Harvard community.
