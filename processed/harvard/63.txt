The Department�s Title IX Liaison was created to help students, staff, faculty, and all in our community deal with any issues concerning sexual and gender-based discrimination, including sexual violence.� The current Title IX Liaisons are� Professors Yuhua Wang and Mashail Malik.
Anyone in the Department can reach out to one of the Liaisons to report misconduct and seek help. The Liaison serves as a neutral point of contact supporting individuals in response to concerns regarding sexual and gender harassment.� Here, we are committed to creating an environment of psychological safety, so that people who have experienced or know of instances of sexual harassment are comfortable reporting it.
It�s important to know that the Liaison is not the sole point of contact for dealing with Title IX issues; it is just one of many options Harvard provides for dealing with these issues. People should feel free to approach anyone inside or outside the Department with whom they feel comfortable sharing their concerns about discrimination, health, and work issues.� They do not have to go through the Department of Government Liaison.
Feel free to contact Liaison Prof. Yuhua Wang yuhuawang@fas.harvard.edu or visit his office at CGIS Knafel Bldg., K 214. Or Liaison Prof. Mashail Malik by mashailmalik@fas.harvard.edu or visit her office at CGIS Knafel Bldg., K208.
Liaisons must disclose all known details about potential incidents of harassment.
Under Harvard�s Title IX, all faculty, staff, and grad students are Responsible Employees while employed by Harvard. As a Responsible Employee, the Liaison then must share with a Title IX Coordinator all known details (�a disclosure�) about potential incidents of sexual or gender-based harassment. However, before revealing details to the Liaison, an individual has the option of working with others,�on and/or off campus, who can provide varying degrees of confidentiality (e.g. lawyers, doctors, mental health clinicians, clergy, ombuds). The individual can decide whether or not to disclose a potential incident to the Liaison.
Please note that sharing a concern with a Title IX Liaison is not the same as filing a formal complaint; filing a formal complaint is a separate process handled by the Office for Dispute Resolution.� Rather, the Liaison is resource to help you make an informed decision about which pathways are right for you. The Title IX Liaison can also arrange�interim�measures (supports that help members of the Harvard community continue with their studies and work and to participate in campus life) and may facilitate�informal�resolutions, as appropriate, between the involved parties, with a goal of memorializing a mutually acceptable resolution in writing.

Law and Justice. Learning how to create a more equitable society.
Overview: The curricular program in Law and Justice allows Government students to look at the intersection of law and politics and learn how political and legal institutions can interact to promote or impede the creation of a just society. It is particularly well-suited for students who plan to go to law school and would like to use their time at Harvard College to complement their future study of legal doctrine with normative and empirical investigations of the social institution of law. Coursework in the program spans all four subfields of political science (political theory, American politics, comparative politics, and international relations), and students are encouraged to pursue their own research on an empirical or normative topic related to law and justice through the Government Department�s senior thesis program.
Requirements: Four courses out of the ten courses required for the concentration, chosen from the list below. �No more than one of the courses can be taken at the Harvard Kennedy School. All four courses for the program must be taken for a letter grade.

Nafees graduated magna cum laude in Government in 2010. She attended Yale Law School, where she was Co-Chair of the Moot Court Board, student government representative,�Yale Law and Policy Review�Notes�Editor, and teaching fellow for four Yale College courses. She is currently an Associate at Boies, Schiller, & Flexner in New York City and a Visiting Fellow at Yale Law School�s Information Society Project. Her research interests include information privacy and civil liberties.
At Harvard, Nafees wrote for�The Harvard�Crimson�and interned both for the British Parliament and the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Immediately after her graduation, she served as a congressional staffer for the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee under Chairman John Conyers. There, she worked on BP oil spill legal issues and constitutional matters with the FBI. On behalf of the committee, she helped to successfully impeach Judge Thomas Porteous, Jr. at trial. Nafees also advised Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson on foreign policy, veterans� affairs, and women�s issues.
As a writer, Nafees has reached millions of readers and spoken to several media outlets on legal issues and current events (CNN, Foreign Policy, The International Journal of the History of Sport, and�The Huffington Post.) Click�here�to�read her June 2018 op-ed in the�New York Times.�More recently, she has spoken at Columbia Law School on a panel on Faith and the Law and at Princeton University on Literary Arts.
Hannah Mullen is a student at Harvard Law School, where she is an editor of the�Harvard Law Review.� She has worked as a summer intern at the Department of Justice and as a summer associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson.� She is especially interested in appellate and constitutional law.� After graduating from law school, Hannah will clerk for Chief Judge Merrick Garland on the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit.� She graduated from Harvard College in 2015 with a Degree in Government.
One of the things that I appreciated the most about the Government Department at Harvard and my degree in general was the amazing staff that were so supportive of my interests that intersected with my focus on International Relations. Whether it was letting me count my Anthropology of Violence and Conflict class towards my degree requirements, helping me figure which classes to take my junior fall to prepare for my study abroad tutorials at Oxford University, or creating more small group section times in the early morning or evening to accommodate my rugby training schedule, the people in the Government Department truly made me feel valued and heard, despite how large our degree class was. As a first-generation college student, being supported by the teaching fellows, the professors and the staff of the Government Department was critical to my undergraduate success. After graduating in 2013, I moved from Cambridge, MA to New York City. This was a pretty big shift for me, as I was the first person in my family to live outside of Massachusetts. I became a trial preparation assistant and then was promoted to investigative analyst in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau in the New York County District Attorney�s Office. Though my main focus as an undergraduate was international conflict, the skills I learned from my Government classes played a large role in my job. The careful analysis of numerical data, being able to take a complex narrative and translate it into something accessible, and being highly organized helped me to excel in my role at the District Attorney�s Office. More importantly, the small group sophomore tutorial laid the groundwork for the interpersonal skills necessary to work as part of a prosecution team. I worked in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau for three years before applying to law school. I am currently a rising 2L at Boston University School of Law. This past summer I was a federal judicial intern in the Honorable Judge Ann Donnelly in the Eastern District of New York, as well as a part time research assistant for Professor Rossman and Clinical Professor Mann. My two research projects were on the history of misdemeanor courts in early America and the intersection of procedural due process and Title XI. Now that the compulsory first year curriculum has passed I am getting back into my academic passion of international relations, as well as writing an international-based �note� as a 2L editor for the Public Interest Law Journal. (I guess I had to write a �thesis� at some point!) My tentative topic is a comparative note on domestic violence jurisprudence in the US and the UK. I would encourage all Harvard undergraduates to take at least one Government class. Regardless of the subfield, a class in Government will teach you to develop a critical eye for history and politics, and enable you to participate in the great debates that capture our collective attention. We all need more informed citizens in this world and there�s no better place to start than here.

You do not need to have any prior yoga experience to join. If you have any questions or concerns about this, we are happy to talk through them with you. These classes will be open to individuals who have experienced power-based interpersonal violence, and we ask that you register in advance.

Title IX Resource Coordinators have specialized experience in responding to disclosures of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. They serve in a neutral role, support all members of the Harvard community, and are expert resources around the University�s policies, procedures, and resources in the realm of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. Resource Coordinators serve as the primary point of contact for individuals seeking supportive measures, individualized supports that enable Harvard community members impacted by sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct to access their work or studies.
Contacting your local Title IX Resource Coordinator is not the same as filing a formal complaint with the University Title IX Coordinator. Rather, the Resource Coordinators are a resource to help you make an informed decision about which pathways are right for you.

The Center for WorkLife Law is an advocacy and research organization at UC Law SF that seeks to advance racial, gender, and class equity. At WorkLife Law, we address inequality at a structural level by developing and implementing concrete, evidence-based interventions in schools and workplaces and changing public policy at the state and national levels. We are extremely strategic in how we approach each structural intervention, forging partnerships with grassroots groups and field experts to identify the best change levers to tackle the problem at hand. With our interventions, we aim to produce dramatic changes within a two to five year timeframe. Our main areas of impact are economic security, maternal & child health, education equity, and racial and gender justice in the workplace. Throughout the pandemic, our team has also mobilized a COVID-19 emergency response, applying our legal expertise to help protect workers� rights during the crisis.
These are just some of the problems that U.S. workers currently face. At the Center for WorkLife Law, we intervene on these problems through both systems-level change and individual interventions.
The Center for WorkLife Law is celebrating the appointment of Sequoia Ayala as a Reproductive Justice Legal Fellow. Sequoia will work to assist birthing persons facing discrimination in the workplace, as well as conduct research on employment discrimination based on pregnancy, lactation, childbirth, and parenthood nationwide for the Center.
Advocating for Strong Implementation to Protect Pregnant Workers
Today the Center for WorkLife Law filed comments with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) offering feedback on its proposed regulations implementing the Pregnant Worker Fairness Act. While the law is already robust, our priority is advocating for the strongest interpretation of the law to protect workers, but especially historically excluded communities, who need accommodations to stay healthy during pregnancy, childbirth, or if they have related medical conditions.
Exciting Advancement of CA Legislation Banning Family Caregiver Discrimination
California�s legislature this week passed important legislation prohibiting discrimination against family caregivers at work! The Family Caregiver Anti-Discrimination Act (AB 524, Wicks) was approved by the California Senate and Assembly and is now headed to the Governor�s desk.� WorkLife Law is proud of the central role its advocacy and research have played in bringing California workers so close to winning this critical workplace protection.

The Department�s Title IX Liaison was created to help students, staff, faculty, and all in our community deal with any issues concerning sexual and gender-based discrimination, including sexual violence.� The current Title IX Liaisons are� Professors Yuhua Wang and Mashail Malik.
Anyone in the Department can reach out to one of the Liaisons to report misconduct and seek help. The Liaison serves as a neutral point of contact supporting individuals in response to concerns regarding sexual and gender harassment.� Here, we are committed to creating an environment of psychological safety, so that people who have experienced or know of instances of sexual harassment are comfortable reporting it.
It�s important to know that the Liaison is not the sole point of contact for dealing with Title IX issues; it is just one of many options Harvard provides for dealing with these issues. People should feel free to approach anyone inside or outside the Department with whom they feel comfortable sharing their concerns about discrimination, health, and work issues.� They do not have to go through the Department of Government Liaison.
Feel free to contact Liaison Prof. Yuhua Wang yuhuawang@fas.harvard.edu or visit his office at CGIS Knafel Bldg., K 214. Or Liaison Prof. Mashail Malik by mashailmalik@fas.harvard.edu or visit her office at CGIS Knafel Bldg., K208.
Liaisons must disclose all known details about potential incidents of harassment.
Under Harvard�s Title IX, all faculty, staff, and grad students are Responsible Employees while employed by Harvard. As a Responsible Employee, the Liaison then must share with a Title IX Coordinator all known details (�a disclosure�) about potential incidents of sexual or gender-based harassment. However, before revealing details to the Liaison, an individual has the option of working with others,�on and/or off campus, who can provide varying degrees of confidentiality (e.g. lawyers, doctors, mental health clinicians, clergy, ombuds). The individual can decide whether or not to disclose a potential incident to the Liaison.
Please note that sharing a concern with a Title IX Liaison is not the same as filing a formal complaint; filing a formal complaint is a separate process handled by the Office for Dispute Resolution.� Rather, the Liaison is resource to help you make an informed decision about which pathways are right for you. The Title IX Liaison can also arrange�interim�measures (supports that help members of the Harvard community continue with their studies and work and to participate in campus life) and may facilitate�informal�resolutions, as appropriate, between the involved parties, with a goal of memorializing a mutually acceptable resolution in writing.
