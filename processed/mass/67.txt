In a rape case where�lack of consent due to intoxication�is an issue, the prosecution must prove not only intoxication, but 1) that the intoxication rendered the complainant incapable of consent and 2) that the defendant knew or should have known that the condition rendered the complainant incapable of consenting.
Comm. v. Gonzalez Santos, 100 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2021)Victim's testimony, standing alone, is evidence. "[T]wo bedrock principles of our law are that alleged�victims of sex crimes are to be treated equally with other alleged victims of crime with respect to credibility, and that those against whom such crimes may or have been perpetrated are fully worthy of legal protection.�As would be true were this any other type of criminal case, therefore, the victim's testimony alone, believed as it was by the jury, suffices to support the defendant's convictions."
Under the Blanche test, above, where there is evidence of the defendant's mental impairment, "not only must the Commonwealth prove that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the complainant's incapacitated state, but the defendant also is entitled to have the jury instructed that they�may consider credible evidence of his mental incapacity, by intoxication or otherwise."
Comm. v. Pena, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 655 (2019)Skin-to-skin contact is not required to prove penetration in rape by unnatural sexual intercourse.
"The defendant's act, while brandishing a gun during an armed robbery, of forcing the victim, against her will, to penetrate her vagina with her fingers, fell within the scope of 'unnatural sexual intercourse' under G. L. c. 265, � 22 (a), and was sufficient to convict the defendant of aggravated rape."
Comm. v. Sherman, 481 Mass. 464 (2019)Withdrawal of consent. "Where the initial penetration was consensual, the fairest and clearest way to draw the line separating consensual sexual intercourse from postpenetration rape is to require, as an element of the offense, that the victim reasonably communicate to the defendant his or her withdrawal of consent."
Court held that "intercourse where consent is achieved by fraud does not constitute rape." The Commonwealth had alleged that the woman believed she was having sex with her boyfriend, when in fact it was her boyfriend's brother. The court called on the Legislature to amend the rape statute, G. L. c. 265, � 22, if they felt that sex through fraud should be categorized as rape.
Statutory rape charges against a juvenile were dismissed, where there "was egregious prosecutorial misconduct in repeatedly and wilfully failing to comply with the discovery order. There was also prejudice to the juvenile's right to a fair trial in that the juvenile was denied the opportunity to develop a factual basis in support of his claim that he was a victim of selective prosecution because the sexual conduct was homosexual rather than heterosexual."
Defendant, who was also under 16, was charged with rape by force, and jury found him guilty of lesser-included statutory rape. Discusses prosecution for statutory rape where both the victim and defendant are under 16.

It is not against the law for a married person to have sex with someone other than their spouse. However, adultery can still play a role in divorce proceedings.
A juvenile cannot be indicted as a youthful offender based on charges of cruelty to animals and bestiality, "given that the language in G. L. c. 199, � 54, the youthful offender statute, allowing a juvenile to be tried as a youthful offender for an offense involving the infliction of "serious bodily harm," does not apply to animal as well as human victims."

Where a boy under 16 was charged for statutory rape for sexual activity with girls under 16, and only the boy was charged, the boy was entitled to discovery of statistical information relevant to his claim of selective prosecution.
The offense of statutory rape, G. L. c. 265, � 23, may be committed with or without any knowledge on the defendant's part of the age of the victim.
"The only elements the Commonwealth must prove are (1) sexual or unnatural sexual intercourse with (2) a child under sixteen years of age".
"A person sixteen years of age or older is legally capable of 'consenting' to sexual intercourse. See G.L. c. 265, � 23; G.L. c. 277, � 39."
"We conclude that 'consanguinity' is a necessary element of the crime of incest, and that the incest statute�makes criminal only relationships between persons related by blood or adoption, not other relationships prohibited by the marriage statute, G.L. c. 207, �� 1 and 2."
Just like in sports, injuries may occur during consensual sex, but you can sue a partner if they engage in wanton or reckless conduct.
Private, consensual sadomasochistic behavior is not a defense to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.�The state has a right to protect its citizens against physical harm.
Consent is not a defense to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, even if it happens during consensual sexual activity. The defense had argued that the SJC case of�Commonwealth v. Appleby, 380 Mass. 296 (1980), which held that consent was not a defense to assault and battery in a sadomasochistic encounter, was no longer valid in light of the Supreme Court case�Lawrence v. Texas,�539 US 558 (2003), which held that��liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.�
The court disagreed, quoting�Appleby: �The fact that violence may be related to sexual activity (or may even be sexual activity to the person inflicting pain on another �) does not prevent the State from protecting its citizens against physical harm.�
Mincer, Elizabeth Fifty shades and fifty states: Is BDSM a fundamental right? A test for sexual privacy, 26 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts. J. 865 (2018).
The Appeals Court defines�the standard of care required in sexual encounters. In this case, one party was injured during consensual sexual intercourse, and sued the other. The court ruled, �While it is inappropriate and unworkable to hold consenting adults to a standard of reasonable care in the conduct of private consensual sexual behavior, we conclude that it is appropriate that they be held to a standard that requires them not to engage in wanton or reckless conduct toward each other during such consensual sexual conduct.�
Neither Massachusetts nor federal law explicitly says you can't have sex with a dead body, but Massachusetts courts have ruled regarding rape charges in connection with sex with a dead body.
Comm vs. Waters, 420 Mass. 276 (1995)An individual was convicted of aggravated rape after having sex with a deceased individual. The court stated that "The evidence certainly warranted a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had had sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent� In the circumstances of one continuous event, it does not matter whether the victim's death preceded or followed the sexual attack."

"G. L. c. 272, � 7, is constitutional, as we construe it to target those who, with the intent to profit from prostitution, live or derive support or maintenance from, or share in the earnings or proceeds of, the known prostitution of others....In short, pimping -- which we define as knowingly and intentionally profiting from the prostitution of another -- is what the Legislature proscribed when enacting the statute that is now G.

The EEOC invites the public to comment on its proposed �Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace�� through https://www.regulations.gov/document/EEOC-2023-0005-0001 until November 1.�
It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person's sex. Harassment can include "sexual harassment" or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.
Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person's sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.
Although the law doesn't prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.
Both federal and state fair housing laws protect people with physical and mental disabilities and provide rights to help them rent apartments and maintain their tenancies. If you feel that you have been discriminated against by a real estate agent, landlord, or housing manager it is important to do something about it.
Refusing to rent to you. For example, landlords or housing managers cannot refuse to rent to a person with a disability because their income is too low if they accept non-disabled applicants with the same income.
Offering you different terms and conditions for your lease. For example, landlords or housing managers cannot require that you, and not other tenants, pay an extra security deposit.
Refusing to reasonably accommodate the needs of a person with disability in order to allow that person to occupy and fully enjoy the unit. For example, a landlord cannot evict a person who is blind for having a service animal.
There are legitimate reasons that a landlord or housing manager can deny your application for the unit, such as an inability to pay the rent that is asked or a history of non-payment of rent or violence, as long as the landlord applies the same standards to all tenants.
Write it down. As soon as you feel you have been discriminated against, write down everything that happened including the date, the time of day, the address and phone number of the person you talked to, everything you said and everything the person said. If you answered a newspaper ad, keep the ad.
Try to arrange to have a test done. Testing is a method used to investigate a landlord or real estate agent to determine if they are illegally discriminating against you. You should contact an agency that does testing:
These agencies will send two testers to the same landlord or real estate agent. If you think you have been discriminated against because of your disability, both testers will give the same information you did about income, household size, type and price of housing you are looking for, etc but one tester will have a disability and the other will not. The test will determine if there is enough proof that discrimination occurred and you can use that proof to file a complaint.
File a complaint. If you think you have been discriminated against, you have the right to file a complaint directly with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) (link), HUD (link), your local fair housing or human rights commission or a court. You should also consider getting an attorney to assist you with this.

In legal terms, sexual harassment is any unwelcome sexual advance or conduct on the job that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. In real life, workplace sexual harassment ranges from repeated offensive or belittling jokes to a workplace full of offensive pornography (creating a hostile work environment) to an outright sexual assault. Although sexual harassment most often takes the form of men harassing women, it can happen to men and women, gay and straight -- in other words, sexual harassment is an equal opportunity offense.
Fortunately, state and federal laws protect workers from sexual harassment on the job -- the same laws that protect workers from discrimination based on gender. At the federal level, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act forbids harassment. In addition, most states have their own fair employment practices laws that prohibit sexual harassment, many of them stricter than the federal law.
If you are being sexually harassed at work, there are a number of things that you should do to protect yourself.
Initially, you can try telling the harasser to stop. Although this confrontation may be difficult for you, it is often the most effective way of dealing with harassment. You're more likely to be successful if the harassment hasn't gone beyond things like off-color jokes, inappropriate comments about your appearance, or tacky cartoons posted onto the office refrigerator.
Clearly saying you want the offensive behavior to stop is important, because it lets the harasser know that the behavior is unwelcome (which it must be in order to meet the legal definition of sexual harassment). It is also a crucial first step if you later decide to take more formal action against the harasser.
If the harasser ignores your oral requests to stop, or if you are uncomfortable talking to the harasser face to face, write a brief letter stating that the behavior offends you and must stop. Be sure to keep a copy.
If you are concerned for your personal safety or are afraid that the harasser might become more hostile when confronted, complain to a supervisor instead.
If confronting the harasser doesn't end the harassment, you should escalate your complaint within the company. Check your company's employee handbook, personnel policies, or manual. Is there a sexual harassment or complaint policy? If so, follow it. If not, ask your supervisor or someone in the human resources or personnel department how to make a sexual harassment complaint. If you don't get the help you need, move up the chain of command to managers and executives, documenting along the way. (See below for tips on how to document your actions.)
Although it is often difficult to make a complaint at work, and you may prefer to skip this step, don't. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that employees who fail to use their employer's internal complaint procedure to make the company aware of sexual harassment, and to give the company a chance to stop it, may not be allowed to hold the company liable in a lawsuit. This means that you are likely to lose in court, should it come to that, if you don't complain within the company first.
Even if your company doesn't have a formal complaint procedure, you should put the company on notice of the harassment. You can do this by making a complaint to the human resources department, telling your supervisor (or his or her supervisor) about the problem, or informing a company executive.
It is very important to document what is happening to you, and what you are doing to try to stop it, should you ever have to prove your case to a company investigator, a government agency, or a jury.
Start by collecting as much detailed evidence as possible about the harassment. Be sure to save any offensive letters, photographs, cards, or notes you receive. If you were made to feel uncomfortable because of jokes, pin-ups, or cartoons posted at work, confiscate them -- or at least make copies. An anonymous, obnoxious photo or joke posted on a bulletin board is not anyone else's personal property, so you are free to take it down and keep it as evidence. If that's not possible, photograph the workplace walls. Note the dates the offensive material was posted -- and whether there were hostile reactions when you took it down or asked someone else to do so.
Also, keep a detailed journal about incidents of harassment. Include the names of everyone involved, what happened, and where and when it took place. If anyone else saw or heard the harassment, note that as well. Be as specific as possible about what was said and done -- and how it affected you, your health, or your job performance. Keep your journal and notes at home or in a safe place outside of work.
Make sure you have copies of your performance evaluations and other important personnel documents. In fact, you may want to ask for a copy of your entire personnel file before complaining about a harassing coworker. Your records can be particularly persuasive evidence if your employer retaliates against you for complaining -- which is also illegal. For example, you'll want a copy of your records if you've had positive performance evaluations until you complain, and then your employer tries to transfer, demote, or fire you, or claims your job performance is poor.
If complaining to your employer doesn't help, the next step is to go to either the federal agency that enforces Title VII -- the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- or to your state fair employment office. If investigation and settlement attempts fail to produce satisfactory results, you can file a civil lawsuit for damages under either Title VII or your state fair employment practices statute.
Even if you intend right from the beginning to file a lawsuit, you sometimes must first file a claim with a government agency. For example, an employee pursuing a claim under federal law must first file a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and a similar complaint procedure is required under state laws.
The EEOC or state agency may decide to prosecute your case on your behalf, but that happens rarely. More commonly, at some point, the agency will issue you a document referred to as a "right-to-sue" letter, which allows you to take your case to court with your own lawyer.
Note, however, that there are time limits for filing claims with government agencies and for filing a lawsuit, so be sure not to miss them.

If you believe your rights may have been violated, we encourage you to report housing discrimination. Because there are time limits on when an allegation can be filed with HUD after an alleged violation, you should report housing discrimination as soon as possible. When reporting housing discrimination, please provide as much information as possible, including:
HUD welcomes and is prepared to receive calls from individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as individuals with speech or communication disabilities.� To learn more about how to make an accessible telephone call, please�visit�https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/telecommunications-relay-service-trs.
You can report housing discrimination in any language. For persons with limited English proficiency, HUD provides interpreters.

It is illegal to retaliate against any person for making an allegation, testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in a proceeding under HUD�s allegation process at any time, even after the investigation has been completed. The Fair Housing Act also makes it illegal to retaliate against any person because that person reported a discriminatory practice to a housing provider or other authority. The Violence Against Women Act also makes it illegal for a public housing agency, owner, or manager of housing assisted under a VAWA covered housing program to retaliate against someone for seeking or exercising VAWA protections for themself or another. This includes protection for people who testify, assist, or participate in any VAWA matter on their own, or another�s, behalf. If you believe you have experienced retaliation, you can report housing discrimination.

"It can be beneficial for self-represented litigants to work informally with one another and with other nonattorneys to acquire and spread information about navigating the eviction process.� We acknowledge, of course, that it is unlawful for any nonattorney to engage in the unauthorized practice of law -- for instance, by signing and filing a complaint on behalf of an unrepresented litigant.� ...But there are plenty of ways for nonattorneys to assist litigants without venturing into the unauthorized practice of law.� ... In a complex, high-stakes process where the right to counsel is not guaranteed and professional assistance is not universally available, the assistance provided by nonattorneys may be the only way for many litigants to learn about and assert their rights."
"We think the language of article 12 of the Declaration of Rights is unambiguous as to the existence of the right within the Commonwealth ...We think, however, that the right to conduct one's own defense is not wholly unqualified..."
LAS Collection Management v. Pagan, 447 Mass. 847 (2006)�The Supreme Judicial Court held that a property agent who is not an attorney may not represent�a property owner in a lawsuit in the Housing Court.�Distinguished by: Michael Hoostein v. Mental Health Association, Inc. 46 N.E.3d 115,� No. 14�P�1643. February 29, 2016. Unpublished opinion, Appeals Court, In contrast to the above case, the plaintiff failed to raise the issue of the defendant being represented by a non-attorney employee before the trial court and therefore, it could be deemed waived. See, e.g., NES Rentals v. Maine Drilling & Blasting, Inc., 465 Mass. 856, 861 n. 8 (2013), issue raised by appellant for first time on appeal is waived). Moreover, as noted by the MHA, participation by a non-attorney in the case does not render the proceedings void. See Henry L. Sawyer Co. v. Boyajian, 296 Mass. 215, 218 (1936).
While the Due Process Clause does not require the provision of counsel in a civil contempt case for failure to pay child support when the opposing parent is not represented by counsel, the court should provide "alternative procedural safeguards," such as "adequate notice of the importance of ability to pay, fair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information, and court findings.�Superseded by statute�45 C.F.R. � 303.6.
Normally, the personal representative of an estate cannot represent the estate pro se. But, in this case, the representative could appear pro se, where she was the only beneficiary and was being sued by the only creditor.
Applying the Apprendi decision to Washington law, the Supreme Court held that the 6th amendment requires any fact (other than a prior conviction) relied upon to impose an exceptional sentence must be admitted by the defendant or found by a jury.
Com. v. Baez, 480 Mass. 328 (2018)Juvenile offenses can be used as predicate offenses for enhanced penalties.
Continued Without a Finding (CWOF) is a sentence that can be challenged by a rule 29 revise and revoke procedure. A judge can't issue a CWOF without terms and conditions or probation.
Com. v. Coelho, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (2019)Revise and revoke.�A defendant can't file a "placeholder" motion within the 60 day time limit and then later supply the grounds on which it is based. Both the motion and an affidavit explaining the reasoning must be filed within the 60 days.
In a conflict of defendants agreeing to a package deal in a plea agreement, the court concluded "package plea offers serve a legitimate public purpose and that such offers are not inherently unfair to a defendant."
Com. v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90 (2018)Probation can be revoked for failing drug test. "We conclude that, in appropriate circumstances, a judge may order a defendant who is addicted to drugs to remain drug free as a condition of probation, and that a defendant may be found to be in violation of his or her probation by subsequently testing positive for an illegal drug."
The state law (MGL c.265, � 47)�that requires everyone placed on probation for certain sex offenses wear a�GPS bracelet�is too broad. The court must decide on a case by case basis whether the particular reasons for imposing GPS monitoring outweigh the intrusion on that defendant's privacy.
Com. v. Henry, 475 Mass. 117 (2016)Restitution and probation. "In determining whether to impose restitution and the amount of any such restitution, a judge must consider a defendant's ability to pay, and may not impose a longer period of probation or extend the length of probation because of a defendant's limited ability to pay restitution." Case then sets out the legal standard for determining the defendant's ability to pay.

Lengthy discussion of seemingly contradictory mandatory minimum sentences in GL c.269, � 10 (m) and appropriate statutory construction.
Com. v. Rossetti, 95 Mass. App. Ct. 552 (2019)Unlawful disposition but no sentence.�Where a�judge had entered a continuance without a finding pursuant to G. L. c. 278, � 18, but did not impose specific conditions as required by the statute and then immediately dismissed the case, the disposition was unlawful. But because that disposition was not a sentence,�relief under rule 29 (a) was not available. Instead, the Commonwealth should have filed an appeal pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) within thirty days of the date on which the charge was dismissed.�Affirmed by 485 Mass. 24.
The court "delineates the differences between a 'minimum term' and a 'mandatory minimum term of imprisonment' or 'mandatory minimum sentence'."
Com. v. Ruiz, 480 Mass. 683 (2018)Habitual criminal. "The Commonwealth has a right under G. L. c. 278, � 28E, and Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (1) to appeal from the dismissal of the sentence enhancement portion of an indictment." Also, �predicate convictions arising from separate qualifying criminal incidents or episodes need not be separately prosecuted in order for a person to be considered a habitual criminal under � 25(a)."
Usually, motions to revise and revoke a sentence have to be based only on the facts as they existed at the time of sentencing. This case creates a limited exception - a judge can consider a sentence on a codefendant who was tried separately, convicted of the same crime, equally responsible, but given a different sentence. The judge may choose to revise the first defendant's sentence in the interest of fairness.
Correcting a sentence under criminal rule 30(a) is not available to a person who has already completed the sentence.
G. L. c. 123, � 16(a), contains no standard for determining whether to commit temporarily a criminal defendant who has been found not criminally responsible by reason of mental illness to a facility other than Bridgewater State Hospital. In mental health context, it is unconstitutional to confine a non-dangerous person against his or her will merely to provide treatment.�"The Legislature may wish to address this point by amending � 16(a) to include a legal standard to guide judges as to when they can order a temporary commitment for observation after a verdict of not criminally responsible."

Harmon v. Commissioner of Correction, 487 Mass. 470 (2021)Medical parole. Prisoners may submit subsequent petitions for medical parole after one has been denied or has not been acted upon; the medical parole statute applies only to committed offenders and not pretrial detainees.
Malloy v. Department of Correction, 487 Mass. 482 (2021)Medical parole. "Once the Commissioner of Correction issues a final, favorable decision... on medical parole..., the Department...must be proactive in working to release the prisoner expeditiously, but reasonable short-term delays are acceptable where they are outside the control of the department..."
Accomplices in fatal crimes can no longer be convicted of first-degree murder unless it is proven that they set out to kill or knew their actions would likely turn fatal. Sets parameters to consider factors and circumstances.

A Juvenile Court judge can't order credit for time served ("preadjudication detention credit") when sentencing.
A murder was committed by 2 defendants - one was 17 and the other was 18 at the time of the crime. The case was�remanded to look at research on brain development after 17 to help decide whether the sentence imposed on the 18 year old defendant (life in prison without the possibility of parole), was constitutional.�Appellate docket SJC-11693.
The SJC concluded "that the imposition of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole on juveniles who are under the age of eighteen when they commit the crime of murder in the first degree is unconstitutional..."
Juvenile homicide offenders serving mandatory sentences of life without parole have a right to counsel at their initial parole hearing, including the right to have counsel appointed if they are indigent. They also have the right to "public funds, if they are indigent, in order to secure reasonably necessary expert assistance at their initial parole hearing." In addition, a juvenile homicide offender who is denied parole has a right to obtain judicial review of the parole board's decision through an action in the nature of certiorari, brought in the Superior Court.

A charge of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen may not form the basis for pretrial detention under G.�L. c.�276, ��58A.
Court held that "community parole supervision for life" under MGL c.127, s.133D (c) is an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers. The court determined that severing that section was not the proper remedy, and so decided to "strike � 133D in its entirety and order that CPSL sentences, whether imposed pursuant to G. L. c. 6, � 178H (a), or G. L. c. 265, � 45, be vacated."
The state law (MGL c.265, � 47) that requires everyone placed on probation for certain sex offenses wear a GPS bracelet is too broad. The court must decide on a case by case basis whether the particular reasons for imposing GPS monitoring outweigh the intrusion on that defendant's privacy.
A person who is in custody for failing to register as a sex offender (and not for the original sex offense) has standing to ask for DNA testing of biological material related to his only sex offense.
Where a defendant committed two separate offenses of open and gross lewdness, but pled guilty to both in the same proceeding, he did not have a "second and subsequent" conviction, and thus, was not required to register as a sex offender.
A level three sex offender was entitled to a hearing before�MGL c.6, s.178K (2)(e)�(barring level three offenders from rest homes) could be applied against him.
The right to a classification hearing is not waived by failure to appear. The Sex Offender Registry Board exceeded its authority in enacting�803 CMR 1.13(2).
Discusses the differences between the Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB) and the civil commitment process (SDP). Case sent back to Superior Court to decide�whether reports prepared in the SDP process should be considered in the SORB classification process.
"[T]he board�lacked authority to adopt regulations�purporting to authorize it to declare that the classification level could be increased absent conviction of a new sex offense."
A sex offender was entitled to have an expert present evidence that his age, and offense-free time prior to incarceration, lowered his risk of reoffense.
"In light of the new implications of classification at a given risk level," the Sex Offender Registry Board must establish the sex offender's risk of reoffense by�clear and convincing evidence. �This is a change from the previous standard of proof of a preponderance of the evidence."
Doe, SORB No. 496501 v. Sex Offender Registry Board, 482 Mass. 643 (2019)Level 2 classification for noncontact offense. "To find that an offender warrants a level two classification, the board must find by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the offender's risk of reoffense is moderate; (2) the offender's dangerousness is moderate; and (3) a public safety interest is served by Internet publication of the offender's registry information....[A]n individual is generally unlikely to pose a moderate degree of dangerousness -- and thus to qualify as a level two sex offender -- where his or her risk of reoffense relates only to noncontact offenses which do not put a victim in fear of bodily harm by reason of a contact sex offense."
Doe, SORB No. 7546 v. Sex Offender Registry Board, 487 Mass. 568 (2021)Premature classification. "The final classification of an incarcerated sex offender who accepted the classification must be based on an evaluation of the offender's risk of reoffense at a time reasonably close to the actual date of discharge."
Outlines requirements for judge in determining whether to relieve juvenile of obligation to register. Also encourages judges to issue written findings.
"In sex offender reclassification proceedings involving an individual seeking downward reclassification, the Sex Offender Registry Board is constitutionally required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the classification remains current and correct, and this court further concluded that the sex offender seeking reclassification bears a burden of production to demonstrate some change in his or her circumstances. Doe, SORB 76819 v. Sex Offender Registry Board, 480 Mass. 212, decided the same day, requires the same burdens of proof and production in proceedings to terminate a sex offender's duty to register.
When both qualified examiners have concluded that a person is no longer sexually dangerous, he must be discharged from civil commitment. "An individual may not be civilly committed as a sexually dangerous person, or have his or her civil commitment continued after petitioning for release from custody, unless at least one of two qualified examiners offers the opinion that the individual is sexually dangerous."
The Massachusetts SJC decided that judges have within 30 days of a trial to issue rulings in regards to deciding whether a defendant should be held indefinitely as a sexually dangerous offender.
Comm. v. Gardner, 480 Mass. 551 (2018)G. L. c. 123A does not permit the commitment of an out of state prisoner, even if he is serving the sentence from another state in a Massachusetts facility.
"It is�error to admit evidence that a defendant refused sex offender treatment where he could receive such treatment only by waiving confidentiality."
"If�the jury found the defendant likely to engage solely in the noncontact offense of viewing child pornography, they could not find him to be an SDP unless they also found that the noncontact offense would instill in his victims a reasonable apprehension of being subjected to a contact sex crime."
In a case involving solely noncontact sex offenses against adult victims, a defendant can be found to be a menace, and therefore a sexually dangerous person, only where the Commonwealth has shown (among other things) that "the defendant's predicted sexual offenses will instill in his victims a reasonable apprehension of being subjected to a contact sex crime."
The state can't proceed with an SDP petition against a convicted sex offender who is about to complete his Massachusetts prison time, but who can't be released back into the community until he has served a federal sentence.
The Supreme Judicial Court further clarified the role of a qualified examiner under MGL c. 123A,�� 9. ��[A] finding of sexual dangerousness must be based, at least in part, on credible examiner opinion testimony and that a jury instruction to that effect is essential to the informed exercise of the jury's fact-finding function.�
"Given the fundamental liberty interest at stake in sexual dangerousness proceedings, this court concluded that it was appropriate for it to review arguments raised for the first time on appeal, and that in doing so, the court would review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice."
College-Town, Division of Interco Inc. v. Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, 400 Mass. 156 (1987)
The court established a strict liability rule under Massachusetts law whereby the employer is liable for acts of its supervisory personnel.
Based on the continuing violation doctrine, claim was not barred by the 6 month statute of limitation period under MGL c. 151B.
The remedies and procedures under MGL c. 151B are exclusive and bar the plaintiff's claim under MGL c. 214, � 1C.���plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative requirements (MCAD) required by employment discrimination statutes precluded her from bringing sexual harassment suit in Superior Court.�
A �sexually hostile or offensive work environment� is one that is pervaded by harassment or abuse, resulting in intimidation, humiliation, and stigmatization that poses a formidable barrier to the plaintiff's full participation in the workplace.
The court held that MGL c. 214, � 1C "does not apply to volunteers, although volunteers retain their common-law rights regarding sexual harassment."
The court concluded that neither the gender or sexual orientation of perpetrators or victims are an element of a sexual harassment claim under MGL c. 151B.
The court held that "sexual harassment accomplished by threats, intimidation or coercion constitutes precisely the kind of conduct" prohibited by the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.
The court reversed policy allowing employers the right to a jury trial in state discrimination proceedings. Cases that stayed with the MCAD could not be assessed for punitive damages, but the employer could be fined.
"An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence."
A plaintiff need not provide direct evidence, but only sufficient circumstantial evidence to show conduct was severe and pervasive under Title VII for sexual discrimination and harassment.
A companion case to Burlington, above. "We hold that an employer is vicariously liable for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor, but subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of a plaintiff victim."
The court held that if conduct in the workplace is so discriminatorily hostile or abusive, Title VII is violated regardless of whether the plaintiff suffered psychological harm. All of the circumstances must be examined to determine whether an environment is hostile or abusive.

Learn about what activities are considered sexual harassment in the workplace and how your rights are protected by the MCAD.
Sexual Harassment in the workplace is illegal under the�Anti-discrimination laws of Massachusetts as a form of sex discrimination.
Massachusetts Law prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace, including same-sex sexual harassment. There are two main categories of sexual harassment: "quid pro quo" harassment and "hostile work environment" harassment.
Massachusetts law describes Quid Pro Quo harassment as�sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct, which the submission or rejection thereof become the basis for employment decisions or a term or condition of employment.
Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive work environment.
An employer is liable for the sexual harassment of employees by managers and persons with supervisory authority, regardless of whether the employer knows of the conduct. An employer may also be liable for sexual harassment committed by persons without actual or apparent supervisory authority, such as co workers. An employer may also be liable for the sexual harassment of its employees by certain non-employees, such as customers, patients, clients, independent contractors or other acquaintances.
Massachusetts�law requires employers with six or more employees to adopt a written policy against sexual harassment. The employer's policy must include notice to employees that sexual harassment in the workplace is unlawful and that it is unlawful to retaliate against an employee for filing a complaint of sexual harassment. The policy should also assert the employer's commitment to investigate any complaint of sexual harassment. The Commission has prepared a Model Sexual Harassment Policy and a poster.
M.G.L. ch. 151B encourages employers to conduct education and training programs on sexual harassment for all employees on a regular basis.

It is against the law for your �landlord� and other tenants to sexually harass you. ��Your �landlord� can be:
Ask or pressure you for sexual acts in exchange for things like reduced rent, repairs or to stop an eviction.
They do not have to ask for sexual acts in words. But the conversation you have with them, or the actions they take, make you understand what they are asking for.
They threaten to evict you or refuse to make repairs. They do not have to evict you or fail to make the repairs to harass you sexually.
They do not threaten you in words, but the conversation you have with them, or the actions they take, make you feel threatened.
Ask your landlord to tell the person to stop harassing you. Keep a copy of your letter or email. Your landlord cannot interfere with your �quiet enjoyment� of your apartment. Your landlord must stop their employee from sexually harassing you. Your landlord must try to stop other tenants from harassing you.
As soon as someone harasses you sexually, write down everything you can remember. The more information, the better. You may not remember all the details later. Your notes can be your strongest evidence if you need to defend yourself from eviction or sue your landlord.
Ask the court for a Harassment Prevention Order. If you get a Harassment Prevention Order, it is a crime for the person to harass you. See Harassment Prevention (258E) Orders.
Use sexual harassment and discrimination as a defense or counterclaim if your landlord tries to evict you. See Legal Defenses and Counterclaims.
File a complaint with the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ can investigate to see if other tenants were sexually harassed.� The DOJ can sue your landlord.
You may be able to get free legal help from your local legal aid program. Or email a question about your own legal problem to a lawyer.

Sexual harassment is a pressing national issue in both the public sphere and many workplaces. Recent high-profile allegations in the media, government, and prominent firms as well as the accompanying social movements (such as #TimesUp and #MeToo) have raised the visibility of sexual harassment, strongly suggesting that workplace sexual harassment has not been effectively addressed�or perhaps even taken seriously�by many employers.
In this report we examine employer responses and the outcomes of 46,210 Title VII sexual harassment discrimination charges filed between 2012 and 2016 with the U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and state Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs). We also examine the EEOC�s processing of the 33,304 Title VII sexual harassment charges filed solely with the EEOC.
After a summary of our main findings, we present a short introduction to the definition of sexual harassment under the law. This is followed by our estimates on the frequency of sexual harassment in U.S. workplaces and the progressively narrow process through which they become complaints and receive redress through the legal system. We then describe the process through which a sexual harassment charge is filed, including a description of the content of these charges.
We go on to describe the gender and race of sexual harassment charging parties as well as the industry breakdown of charges. This is followed by analyses of employer responses to sexual harassment allegations as well as EEOC processing of these complaints. Our final analysis examines the distribution of benefits to the charging party from sexual harassment complaints. We conclude with a recommendation that workplace sexual harassment needs to be managed by employers as a human resource problem, rather than as a legal threat.
About 5 million employees are sexually harassed at work every yearThe overwhelming majority (99.8%) of people who experience sexual harassment at work never file formal charges.
Most employers react punitively toward people who file formal sexual harassment charges.68% of sexual harassment charges include an allegation of employer retaliation, this rate is highest for Black women.
64% of sexual harassment charges are associated with job loss, and this rate is highest for White women and White men.
Industries vary widely in their sexual harassment discrimination charge rates.In all industries women are more likely than men to file charges, but this sex difference grows in male dominated industries.
While the EEOC initially tends to judge sexual harassment charges as more likely than other discrimination complaints to sustain a finding of legal cause, most individuals benefit little from EEOC case processing.27% of employees who file a sexual harassment charge with the EEOC and continue to pursue redress, receive any benefit
Our conclusion from these results is that sexual harassment, and perhaps discrimination of all types, should be addressed proactively and affirmatively as managerial responsibilities, rather than leaving it to the targets of discrimination to pursue legal remedies as individuals.
Sexual harassment at work is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. The legal status of sexual harassment discrimination was unclear until 1986 when the U.S. Supreme Court endorsed the view that sexual harassment was sex discrimination under Title VII in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson.
The legal standard for sexual harassment is generally higher than unwanted sexual behaviors. According to the EEOC, the government agency responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or employee, the law does not prohibit teasing, offhand comments, or �isolated incidents that are not very serious�.1
Unwanted sexual behavior becomes illegal when it meets at least one of two legal standards. Under the quid pro quo standard there must be an implicit or explicit threat of some job related loss if the employee does not submit to a sexual encounter. Under the hostile workplace environment standard, the sexual encounter must be repeated or severe enough to create an intimidating or hostile work environment or result in an adverse employment decision. The harasser can be the target�s supervisor, co-worker, or even a client or customer. Employers, however, are responsible for sexual harassment discrimination under the law.
In our analysis of all discrimination charges filed with the EEOC, including those submitted to the EEOC from state Fair Employment Practice Agencies, between 2012 and 2016 we find that 12% of all Title VII discrimination charges contained a sexual harassment allegation. Sexual harassment allegations are more common than all other discrimination issues, with the exception of firing, workplace terms and conditions, discipline, and non-sexual harassment.2
Estimating a workplace sexual harassment rate is difficult. The experience of harassment varies as a function of age, the invasiveness of the encounter, and the legal and bodily rights consciousness of the target. Self-reports of perceived workplace sexual harassment during the last year from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) suggest that each year approximately 5% of employed women and 2% of employed men experienced unwanted sexual behavior that they perceived as sexual harassment at work.3��The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission estimates that cumulatively across their careers up to 85% of women will be sexually harassed one or more times. Importantly, the EEOC also estimates that three out of four individuals who experience sexual harassment in the workplace never tell a supervisor, manager, or union representative about the incident.4�The experience of sexual harassment at work is widespread and compounds across the career for both men and women.
While many people experience sexual harassment at some time, relatively few report those experiences to the EEOC.5�Using the General Social Survey percentages multiplied by the U.S. workforce, we estimate that there are 5,117,835 people who believe they have experienced sexual harassment every year. In the charge records, we calculate that 9,242 charges of sexual harassment were filed with the EEOC or local FEPA on average each year from 2012-2016.
Sexual harassment complaints represent only 0.18% of those who we estimate experienced sexual harassment at work.6�Since the legal standards are high, it is not surprising that only a very few file a charge. Not filing a charge may also make economic and social sense. As we report below, there are often severe negative consequences to filing a charge, and most people who do file a charge receive no benefits.
Figure 1: Dispute Pyramid for Targets of Workplace Sexual Harassment(estimates are yearly averages for 2012-2016)
The process of filing a sexual harassment charge is illustrated in Figure 1 as a dispute pyramid.7 The stages in the pyramid reflect what Felstiner et al. (1980) have called the �naming, blaming, and claiming� process in which injurious experiences are transformed into formal grievances.8 The base of the pyramid represents the estimated 5.1 million workers who experience a workplace incident they perceived as sexual harassment. Of those who perceive their experience as sexual harassment (�naming�), somewhere between 25% and 40% of them, or 1.2-2.0 million employees, will report internally to a supervisor, union or human resource department (�blaming�).9 As noted above, an even smaller subset of about 9,200 people are in the EEOC and FEPA charge database, having moved forward with filing an official charge (�claiming�). This figure grows smaller either because the issue is resolved internally or the complainant chooses not to move forward with the case for other reasons such as fear, lack of resources or understanding of the law, or time to file a charge. In other words, 99.8% of people who experience sexual harassment at work never file a sexual harassment charge. Even among the subset of people who seek redress in the workplace upward of 99% never file a formal sexual harassment charge outside the workplace.
Most (8,147 on average per year) sexual harassment charges are judged by the EEOC to potentially be legally actionable when they are first filed, suggesting that the vast majority of sexual harassment discrimination charges are on their face credible and meet a set of procedural criteria including recency of the event. Frivolous charges are likely to be vanishingly rare. Despite this, only 1,797 charging parties per year receive any benefit through the EEOC�s processes of mediation and conciliation brokered by the EEOC between the employee and their employer. After formally filing a charge, a small proportion of charges divert from the EEOC and into the courts. Although we do not have a precise estimate, we believe that the numbers are similarly small for the civil court system.
While the conversion of sexual harassment experiences into workplace complaints or legal claims is complex, our estimates are clear that the majority of people who experience sexual harassment do not register complaints with their employers, and very few file formal charges. Past research suggests that the individuals who file charges first lodged complaints to their employers but did not get an adequate response or were punished for doing so.10
That same research suggests that most people who file discrimination complaints are not primarily seeking monetary damages, but often want their job back, the perpetrator punished, or to improve working conditions in their workplace for themselves and coworkers. Furthermore, past research has found that targets of sexual harassment typically attempt to remedy the situation on their own by ignoring it or confronting the harasser before reporting the harassment to a supervisor or to human resources. Overall, prior research suggests that targets of sexual harassment are not �trouble makers�, but simply trying to do their job.11�Research has also found that people choose not to file sexual harassment complaints at work because they do not trust the process, do not expect it to be confidential, and/or expect retaliation.12
Formal charges of sexual harassment discrimination roughly represent the population of complaints where the charging party felt aggrieved, understood that they had rights under the law, felt safe enough to pursue a formal charge, believed that the severity of the encounters might rise to the high legal standards required to sustain a legal finding, and who had the resources to file a complaint.13 The problem of sexual harassment is obviously much larger than the incidence of legal charges. In fact, it is striking how rare sexual harassment charges are relative to the experience of unwanted workplace sexual encounters.
Before an employee who believes they have been discriminated against can file a lawsuit against their employer, they first must submit a complaint to the EEOC or a local state Fair Employment Practices Agency (FEPAs).14
A basis is the legally protected category that the plaintiff claims was the basis of discrimination. Under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and its extensions these protected categories include race, sex, color, religion, disability, age, and national origin. Sexual harassment claims will almost always include a sex basis. Additionally, the law prohibits retaliation against individuals who file a discrimination claim by protecting an employee�s right to oppose unlawful discrimination, so retaliation is considered another basis.
An issue is the employer action or policy alleged to be discriminatory�the kind of discrimination that took place�such as firing, demotion, or sexual harassment. Charges often contain multiple bases and issues.
Figure 2 shows an example of a common sexual harassment discrimination charge. It includes two bases, gender and retaliation, and three issues: sexual harassment, firing, and discipline. For the charges filed in calendar years 2012-2016, we find that sexual harassment charges are nearly always on the basis of sex (97%).15�Sixty-eight percent of the time sexual harassment charges were linked to employer retaliation after the internal or external complaints of sexual harassment.16�Race/color discrimination was the next most frequent joint basis for a sexual harassment discrimination charge (12%).
Only 11% of sexual harassment charges were filed exclusively as sexual harassment complaints (i.e. contained sexual harassment as the only issue). The most frequent co-occurring issues were discriminatory job loss (64%), general harassment (28%), and terms and conditions of work (26%).17�Compared to all other Title VII charges that do not contain a sexual harassment allegation, sexual harassment charges are more likely to allege constructive discharge and intimidation (see Table 1). Constructive discharge refers to employer retaliation or sexual harassment severe enough to lead a reasonable employee to quit their job. Sexual harassment is infrequently associated with other discrimination complaints, such as discrimination in hiring, promotion, and pay discrimination.
After the charge is filed, the EEOC has several routes to resolving charges, any of which can lead to monetary or other benefits for the charging party. The EEOC offers charging parties and their employers a mediation process with a third party mediator to resolve a complaint before an investigation occurs.18�Charges are also sometimes settled during an investigation. After an investigation in which the EEOC finds reasonable cause to believe discrimination has occurred, the EEOC works to resolve a complaint through a conciliation process. If conciliation fails, either the charging party or the EEOC may file a lawsuit in court. Most charges are settled in the EEOC�s mediation or conciliation processes or are dropped. A charging party may drop out of the EEOC process and request a right to sue letter or the charge may be closed for administrative reasons such as failure to locate the charging party, lack of jurisdiction, or the charging party requests withdrawal of the charge.19.�In our data, 20% of sexual harassment charges were closed for these administrative reasons.
The EEOC reports that in fiscal year 2010, conciliation was successful for 27% of all discrimination charges, and the rate of successful conciliation increased to 38% of charges in fiscal year 2014.20.�Only a small number go to court, and only very rarely with the EEOC suing the employer. We do not know what this rate is specifically for sexual harassment charges, but in 2016 there were 91,503 discrimination charges filed with the EEOC and the EEOC took 114, about 0.1% of charges received, to court.
Charging parties can get a �right to sue� letter from the EEOC and bring a lawsuit to court via the private bar. One study estimates that 17% of charges of racial discrimination result in a lawsuit being filed by the charging party, but another estimates that less than 1% result in a lawsuit.22�If sexual harassment complaints are similar, these wildly divergent estimates suggest that between 90 and 1,571 sexual harassment lawsuits were actually filed in courts in an average year. Since we estimate that there are more than 5 million incidences per year, the clear conclusion is that the vast majority of workplace sexual harassment incidences never lead to an EEOC discrimination complaint and very few of these ever make it to court. This low rate of filing also suggests that the key responders to sexual harassment in workplaces are those who are harassed and their managers
Table 2 describes the demographics of charging parties for charges containing a sexual harassment allegation, all other non-sexual harassment charges alleging Title VII discrimination, and for the subset of sex-based discrimination complaints that do not include sexual harassment as an issue. Sex-based charges include those Title VII charges made on the basis of one�s sex, male or female, as well as charges based on one�s sexual orientation or gender identity.22
Women filed 57% of all other (non sexual harassment) Title VII complaints, 75% of sex-based Title VII complaints, and 81% of all sexual harassment allegations. Though women are much more likely to experience sexual harassment at work and file a formal charge, men experience this issue as well: 19% of sexual harassment charges were filed by men.
Based on the General Social Survey estimates reported above, among those who experience sexual harassment at work, women are more likely than men to eventually file a formal charge. Women are 72% (with a confidence interval of plus or minus 1%) of those reporting experiencing sexual harassment at work on a survey, but 81% of those filing charges. We do not know if this represents differences in the seriousness of the harassment, more effective employer redress of sexual harassment complaints from men, or higher male reluctance to report.
Relative to other Title VII discrimination charges, sexual harassment charges are much more common among white women, roughly equally common among white men (who file absolutely fewer discrimination complaints than other status groups), less common among black women, and much less frequent among black men.
Relative to their representation in the labor market overall, women report a disproportionate amount of workplace sexual harassment. Although they comprise 47% of the labor force, women file 81% of sexual harassment charges. Black women, in particular, report a disproportionately large percentage of workplace sexual harassment charges; they account for 7% of the labor force but file 27% of sexual harassment charges.
About half of all case processing reports are missing information on the industry of the workplace. Thus it is difficult to make precise estimates of industry variation in charge rates. Past research suggests that sexual harassment is more common in workplaces with a hyper-masculine culture and where management tolerates abusive behavior in general.23�Given that the vast majority of sexual harassment experiences go unreported, we have no way of knowing if rates of reporting or the quality of managerial responses to internal complaints vary by industry. Given these limitations we have calculated rates by industry of sexual harassment reports to the EEOC and the state FEPAs. We calculate the rates by dividing the number of sexual harassment cases by the gender specific industry labor force.24�Figure 3 displays these results.
Figure 3 is sorted by the female sexual harassment charge rate. Sexual harassment charges filed by women are least common in government, health care and social assistance and finance. They are most common in mining, warehousing, and transportation. In general female sexual harassment charges are higher in male dominated industries (correlation = .77). �Male sexual harassment charge rates are lower than those filed by women in all industries. They are highest in educational services, followed by warehousing, accommodations and food service, and health care. Male charge rates are lowest in public administration, followed by wholesale trade, construction, and professional services. The rate of male sexual harassment charges is also associated with the sex composition of employment, with a weak tendency to be higher in industries with more women employees (correlation coefficient = .42).
Past research is clear that harassment, firing and retaliation are frequent employer responses to complaints of discrimination.25�Our analysis shows that sexual harassment is no exception to this pattern. Sixty-eight percent of sexual harassment allegations include a charge of employer retaliation in the face of a discrimination complaint. Almost two-thirds of those filing sexual harassment charges (64%) report losing their jobs as a result of their complaint.26�High instances of job loss and retaliation are present across race and sex categories (Table 3).
Most employer responses tend to be harsh both via retaliation and firing employees who complain. The very low proportion of employees who file sexual harassment complaints is very likely to be related to employers� typically punitive responses. We do not know whether the retaliation occurred after the targeted employee reported the sexual harassment internally or after the charge was filed with the EEOC or FEPA. However, what is clear is that complaining about sexual harassment is quite dangerous, inciting employer retaliation and firing in most instances.
White men and White women are more like to lose their jobs than are other groups. Black women, in contrast, are less likely to lose their job, although most do. Clearly filing a sexual harassment discrimination charge is no protection against job loss, and probably increased the likelihood that the charging party will lose their job.
Employer retaliation is widespread, since two-thirds report it. It is highest for Black women, but almost as high for all groups. Retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination is explicitly prohibited by federal law, but is apparently normative in many workplaces. �This pattern of extreme retribution fits what we have learned from past research, which finds that employers, following the advice of internal and external legal counsel, react to internal discrimination complaints with aggressive attacks on those who complain. This tactic is designed to isolate the charging party and to send a message to other workers that the cost of pursuing legal remedies to discrimination will be prohibitively high.27
This section focuses on the processing of sexual harassment charges for the 33,304 Title VII sexual harassment charges filed directly with the EEOC.28�When a charge is filed with the EEOC it is given an initial processing code indicating the likelihood that the charge has sufficient evidence to support a legal finding of employment discrimination. A code of �A� by the EEOC intake staff indicates that the complaint is likely to be able to demonstrate legal cause that discrimination occurred, and those charges are more likely to be investigated by the EEOC.29.
The �B� code suggests legal cause may be present but additional information is needed, and they are more likely to be offered EEOC brokered mediation with the employer. The code �C� indicates that the intake staff judged that legal cause was unlikely, often because the filing deadline was missed or because the charge is not related to laws enforced by the EEOC.
In Table 4 we compare initial processing categories for Title VII sex-based charges by issue type for charges filed with the EEOC. Most discrimination charges of all types are initially assessed as either A or B. Overall, about one quarter (23%) are coded �A� and more than half (61%) of all sex-based Title VII charges are processed as type �B�. Category C charges are the smallest group of initial assessments (16%). Thus, most charges that make it to the EEOC are judged by intake staff to be potentially serious and to plausibly contain legal merit. This initial assessment of the potential merit of charges should not be surprising since very few discrimination experiences ever make it to the stage of filing formal discrimination charges.
Table 4 also compares all issues alleged in sex-based Title VII charges. Sexual harassment discrimination charges are the most likely of all sex-based Title VII charges to be processed as �A� (33%), followed closely by intimidation (32%). Both tend to have clear perpetrators and targets, making legal findings easier to establish.
EEOC initial processing tends to evaluate sexual harassment allegations as more likely to eventually demonstrate legal cause than other charges of Title VII or sex-based discrimination. While the EEOC initial charge processing assesses that the majority of all types of discrimination charges as potentially meritorious, combining A and B codes sexual harassment charges appear to present at least as much initial evidence of merit as other charges. There is no evidence here that the EEOC takes sexual harassment charges less seriously than other discrimination charges.
A charging party�s race and gender may also influence the likelihood that a charge is categorized as legally actionable. Among sexual harassment charges filed with the EEOC, those filed by white women are more likely to be processed as �A� when compared to both black women and all men. Thirty-five percent of sexual harassment charges filed by white women were processed as �A� compared to 31% of those filed by black women. Cases filed by men of all races are seen as less legally actionable in initial processing.
This section focuses on the outcomes of sexual harassment charges filed with either the EEOC or state/local FEPA. These outcomes reflect settlements in which the charging party did not withdraw their charge and thus proceeded through mediation, negotiation/settlement, or conciliation.
Table 6 shows the percent of charges that received any (monetary or nonmonetary) benefit by issue type. Among non-sexual harassment charges, between 14 and 21 percent of all Title VII charges and 17 to 24 percent of sex-based Title VII charges received a benefit.30�Twenty-seven percent of sexual harassment charges received some benefit, again the highest percent of all issues.
Most people who file discrimination charges, including discrimination charges that the EEOC judges initially to be legally actionable, do not receive any benefit. At the same time sexual harassment charges stand out as more likely than other discrimination issues to secure some benefit. About a quarter of people who file sexual harassment charges, and do not withdraw their charge, receive some benefit under this process.
A complainant�s race and gender are associated with the likelihood of a sexual harassment discrimination charge receiving a benefit. Sexual harassment charges filed by women, particularly White women, are more likely to receive a benefit compared to women of other races and to men. 29% of sexual harassment charges filed by White women received a benefit, compared to 23% of those filed by Black women, 21% by White men, and 18% by Black men (see Table 7).
The charges that proceed through mediation, conciliation, or (more rarely) court processes typically result in no compensation or a modest monetary compensation for the charging party. Very few cases lead to the changes at the workplace level that many charging parties seek (see Table 8). Almost 3 out of 4 (73%) sexual harassment charges produce no benefit of either kind for the charging party.
Twenty-three percent of sexual harassment charges produce some monetary benefit for the charging party, and 12% result in a workplace-level change of some sort. Nearly 9 out of 10 (88%) sexual harassment charges do not lead to any required change in employer behavior or managerial practices. Eight percent of sexual harassment charges lead to both a monetary benefit for the charging party and some negotiated change in workplace managerial practices.
High profile media cases often focus on large monetary settlements for the targets of sexual harassment. For example, FOX News paid former broadcaster Gretchen Carlson $20 million to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit against former FOX News CEO Roger Ailes. But outcomes for most sexual harassment charges are much smaller. Overall, charging parties who received monetary compensation for sexual harassment charges were awarded $24,700 on average. Large monetary benefits are very rare�only 1% of charges resulted in monetary compensation over $100,000 (Table 9).
Twenty-eight percent of those who filed a sexual harassment charge were represented by legal counsel. Those represented by legal counsel received higher compensation, $38,732 on average. This is about 50% higher than those not represented by legal counsel. However, lawyers typically get a third of any settlement, reducing the added monetary value of representation. There is both a small monetary benefit to securing legal counsel and a higher probability (35% vs 20%) of receiving a monetary settlement.
Note: Average and median monetary amounts reported for closed charges which did not withdraw their charge for administrative reasons and who received any non-zero monetary amount.
Those represented by counsel are also more likely to also allege job loss and retaliation (Table 10). This suggests that lawyers view sexual harassment cases that allege harsh employer response as more legally actionable and potentially lucrative.
Overall, charging parties in sexual harassment complaints typically receive nothing or a modest monetary settlement and no change in their workplace. Those who lost their job are only very slightly more likely to receive a monetary benefit, an average of $24,700, which is unlikely to make up for the economic cost of the job loss. Even cases where the charging party experienced severe negative consequences like job loss, 73% of cases received no benefit.
Sexual harassment remains a persistent and serious threat to women and men in American workplaces. While the vast majority of those who experience sexual harassment in the workplace never report this harassment internally nor file a formal discrimination charge, those who do are typically confronted by harsh outcomes.
Our analyses of five years of sexual harassment charges filed with the EEOC and local FEPAs reveals that the majority of those who report sexual harassment experience retaliation (68%) and job loss (64%) while receiving little ($24,700 on average), or more often, no compensation. Although the EEOC initially processes most sexual harassment charges as potentially legally actionable (88%), only a minority of cases (27%) result in any benefit. While past research has found the majority of those who file a charge do so in hopes to initiate change in their workplace, we find that only 12% of charges result in any workplace policy change. Thus, those who pursued legal remedies may be left feeling that the benefits they hope to receive are not the outcomes they experience.31
The current case processing practices at the EEOC and state FEPAs do not appear to be serving all charging parties well. Most cases appear legally plausible, but most receive no benefits. The EEOC has long worked under a backlog of cases. The EEOC�s funding levels are simply insufficient to investigate and pursue all the discrimination cases they are presented with. At the same time the formal discrimination charge process probably generates substantial employment and revenue for defendant firm�s legal teams.
While the contemporary legal process of workplace sexual harassment appears to lead to suboptimal results, the current social movements around sexual harassment certainly can play a role in empowering targets, changing managerial responses, and even preventing future workplace sexual harassment. Current activism has helped call attention to the pervasiveness of
sexual harassment and initiated conversation regarding sexual harassment in many workplaces. If those conversations lead to changes in managerial practices promoting respectful treatment in workplaces and the empowerment of employees who experience sexual harassment, then they may help prevent sexual harassment and create safer, less abusive, workplaces.
Given current practices the legal route is unlikely to produce this outcome. Sexual harassment, and perhaps discrimination of all types, might be better addressed by managers treating them as managerial responsibilities, rather than effectively outsourcing them as legal problems.32�The EEOC has made precisely this recommendation in its recent report on harassment and has introduced training in managerial practices and the creation of respectful workplaces to educate employers as to how to reduce sexual and other forms of harassment at work.33� It is unclear how widespread or effective that training is, but it certainly seems a step in the right direction.
2. Harassment includes conduct such as offensive jokes, slurs, threats, mockery, and interference with work performance that creates a hostile work environment. If the harassment is sexual in nature, such as unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, or other verbal/physical harassment of a sexual nature, it is considered sexual harassment.

Many of the charges filed with FEPAs and submitted to the EEOC �do not include data on the race, sex, or other demographic characteristics of the charging party.

Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
This guidance document was issued upon approval by vote of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
This document addresses the standards of liability for harassment by supervisors based on based on sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, or protected activity.
The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.
The standard for employer liability for hostile work environment harassment depends typically on whether or not the harasser is the victim's supervisor. An employer is vicariously liable for a hostile work environment created by a supervisor. In Vance v. Ball State University, 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013), the Supreme Court rejected in part the EEOC's definition of 'supervisor.' The Court held that an employee is a 'supervisor' if the employer has empowered that employee 'to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.'' The Court stated that an employer is liable for hostile work environment harassment by employees who are not supervisors if the employer was 'negligent in failing to prevent harassment from taking place.' In assessing such negligence, the Court explained, 'the nature and degree of authority wielded by the harasser is an important factor to be considered in determining whether the employer was negligent.' Also relevant is '[e]vidence that an employer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond to complaints, failed to provide a system for registering complaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from being filed.'
The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.
2. PURPOSE: This document provides guidance regarding employer liability for harassment by supervisors based on sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, or protected activity.
4. EXPIRATION DATE: As an exception to EEOC Order 205.001, Appendix B, Attachment 4, � a(5), this Notice will remain in effect until rescinded or superseded.
In Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. 2257 (1998), and Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 118 S. Ct. 2275 (1998), the Supreme Court made clear that employers are subject to vicarious liability for unlawful harassment by supervisors. The standard of liability set forth in these decisions is premised on two principles: 1) an employer is responsible for the acts of its supervisors, and 2) employers should be encouraged to prevent harassment and employees should be encouraged to avoid or limit the harm from harassment. In order to accommodate these principles, the Court held that an employer is always liable for a supervisor�s harassment if it culminates in a tangible employment action. However, if it does not, the employer may be able to avoid liability or limit damages by establishing an affirmative defense that includes two necessary elements:
the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.
While the Faragher and Ellerth decisions addressed sexual harassment, the Court�s analysis drew upon standards set forth in cases involving harassment on other protected bases. Moreover, the Commission has always taken the position that the same basic standards apply to all types of prohibited harassment.1 Thus, the standard of liability set forth in the decisions applies to all forms of unlawful harassment. (See section II, below.)
Harassment remains a pervasive problem in American workplaces. The number of harassment charges filed with the EEOC and state fair employment practices agencies has risen significantly in recent years. For example, the number of sexual harassment charges has increased from 6,883 in fiscal year 1991 to 15,618 in fiscal year 1998. The number of racial harassment charges rose from 4,910 to 9,908 charges in the same time period.
While the anti-discrimination statutes seek to remedy discrimination, their primary purpose is to prevent violations. The Supreme Court, in Faragher and Ellerth, relied on Commission guidance which has long advised employers to take all necessary steps to prevent harassment.2 The new affirmative defense gives credit for such preventive efforts by an employer, thereby �implement[ing] clear statutory policy and complement[ing] the Government�s Title VII enforcement efforts.�3
The question of liability arises only after there is a determination that unlawful harassment occurred. Harassment does not violate federal law unless it involves discriminatory treatment on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age of 40 or older, disability, or protected activity under the anti-discrimination statutes. Furthermore, the anti-discrimination statutes are not a �general civility code.�4 Thus federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not �extremely serious.�5 Rather, the conduct must be �so objectively offensive as to alter the �conditions� of the victim�s employment.�6 The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminated in a tangible employment action or was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment.7 Existing Commission guidance on the standards for determining whether challenged conduct rises to the level of unlawful harassment remains in effect.
This document supersedes previous Commission guidance on the issue of vicarious liability for harassment by supervisors.8 The Commission�s long-standing guidance on employer liability for harassment by co-workers remains in effect - - an employer is liable if it knew or should have known of the misconduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action.9 The standard is the same in the case of non-employees, but the employer�s control over such individuals� misconduct is considered.10
The rule in Ellerth and Faragher regarding vicarious liability applies to harassment by supervisors based on race, color, sex (whether or not of a sexual nature11), religion, national origin, protected activity,12 age, or disability.13 Thus, employers should establish anti-harassment policies and complaint procedures covering all forms of unlawful harassment.14
An employer is subject to vicarious liability for unlawful harassment if the harassment was committed by �a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.�15 Thus, it is critical to determine whether the person who engaged in unlawful harassment had supervisory authority over the complainant.
The federal employment discrimination statutes do not contain or define the term �supervisor.�16 The statutes make employers liable for the discriminatory acts of their �agents,�17 and supervisors are agents of their employers. However, agency principles �may not be transferable in all their particulars� to the federal employment discrimination statutes.18 The determination of whether an individual has sufficient authority to qualify as a �supervisor� for purposes of vicarious liability cannot be resolved by a purely mechanical application of agency law.19 Rather, the purposes of the anti-discrimination statutes and the reasoning of the Supreme Court decisions on harassment must be considered.
The Supreme Court, in Faragher and Ellerth, reasoned that vicarious liability for supervisor harassment is appropriate because supervisors are aided in such misconduct by the authority that the employers delegated to them.20 Therefore, that authority must be of a sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out the harassment. The determination as to whether a harasser had such authority is based on his or her job function rather than job title (e.g., �team leader�) and must be based on the specific facts.
the individual has authority to undertake or recommend tangible employment decisions affecting the employee; or
An individual qualifies as an employee�s �supervisor� if he or she is authorized to undertake tangible employment decisions affecting the employee. �Tangible employment decisions� are decisions that significantly change another employee�s employment status. (For a detailed explanation of what constitutes a tangible employment action, see subsection IV(B), below.) Such actions include, but are not limited to, hiring, firing, promoting, demoting, and reassigning the employee. As the Supreme Court stated,�[t]angible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor.�21
An individual whose job responsibilities include the authority to recommend tangible job decisions affecting an employee qualifies as his or her supervisor even if the individual does not have the final say. As the Supreme Court recognized in Ellerth, a tangible employment decision �may be subject to review by higher level supervisors.�22 As long as the individual�s recommendation is given substantial weight by the final decision maker(s), that individual meets the definition of supervisor.
An individual who is authorized to direct another employee�s day-to-day work activities qualifies as his or her supervisor even if that individual does not have the authority to undertake or recommend tangible job decisions. Such an individual�s ability to commit harassment is enhanced by his or her authority to increase the employee�s workload or assign undesirable tasks, and hence it is appropriate to consider such a person a �supervisor� when determining whether the employer is vicariously liable.
In Faragher, one of the harassers was authorized to hire, supervise, counsel, and discipline lifeguards, while the other harasser was responsible for making the lifeguards� daily work assignments and supervising their work and fitness training.23 There was no question that the Court viewed them both as �supervisors,� even though one of them apparently lacked authority regarding tangible job decisions.24
An individual who is temporarily authorized to direct another employee�s daily work activities qualifies as his or her �supervisor� during that time period. Accordingly, the employer would be subject to vicarious liability if that individual commits unlawful harassment of a subordinate while serving as his or her supervisor.
On the other hand, someone who merely relays other officials� instructions regarding work assignments and reports back to those officials does not have true supervisory authority. Furthermore, someone who directs only a limited number of tasks or assignments would not qualify as a �supervisor.� For example, an individual whose delegated authority is confined to coordinating a work project of limited scope is not a �supervisor.�
In some circumstances, an employer may be subject to vicarious liability for harassment by a supervisor who does not have actual authority over the employee. Such a result is appropriate if the employee reasonably believed that the harasser had such power.25 The employee might have such a belief because, for example, the chains of command are unclear. Alternatively, the employee might reasonably believe that a harasser with broad delegated powers has the ability to significantly influence employment decisions affecting him or her even if the harasser is outside the employee�s chain of command.
If the harasser had no actual supervisory power over the employee, and the employee did not reasonably believe that the harasser had such authority, then the standard of liability for co-worker harassment applies.
An employer is always liable for harassment by a supervisor on a prohibited basis that culminates in a tangible employment action. No affirmative defense is available in such cases.26 The Supreme Court recognized that this result is appropriate because an employer acts through its supervisors, and a supervisor�s undertaking of a tangible employment action constitutes an act of the employer.27
A tangible employment action is �a significant change in employment status.�28 Unfulfilled threats are insufficient. Characteristics of a tangible employment action are:29
1. A tangible employment action is the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates, as demonstrated by the following :
3. A tangible employment action, in most instances, can only be caused by a supervisor or other person acting with the authority of the company.
Any employment action qualifies as �tangible� if it results in a significant change in employment status. For example, significantly changing an individual�s duties in his or her existing job constitutes a tangible employment action regardless of whether the individual retains the same salary and benefits.32 Similarly, altering an individual�s duties in a way that blocks his or her opportunity for promotion or salary increases also constitutes a tangible employment action.33
On the other hand, an employment action does not reach the threshold of �tangible� if it results in only an insignificant change in the complainant�s employment status. For example, altering an individual�s job title does not qualify as a tangible employment action if there is no change in salary, benefits, duties, or prestige, and the only effect is a bruised ego.34 However, if there is a significant change in the status of the position because the new title is less prestigious and thereby effectively constitutes a demotion, a tangible employment action would be found.35
If a supervisor undertakes or recommends a tangible job action based on a subordinate�s response to unwelcome sexual demands, the employer is liable and cannot raise the affirmative defense. The result is the same whether the employee rejects the demands and is subjected to an adverse tangible employment action or submits to the demands and consequently obtains a tangible job benefit.36 Such harassment previously would have been characterized as �quid pro quo.� It would be a perverse result if the employer is foreclosed from raising the affirmative defense if its supervisor denies a tangible job benefit based on an employee�s rejection of unwelcome sexual demands, but can raise the defense if its supervisor grants a tangible job benefit based on submission to such demands. The Commission rejects such an analysis. In both those situations the supervisor undertakes a tangible employment action on a discriminatory basis. The Supreme Court stated that there must be a significant change in employment status; it did not require that the change be adverse in order to qualify as tangible.37
If a challenged employment action is not �tangible,� it may still be considered, along with other evidence, as part of a hostile environment claim that is subject to the affirmative defense. In Ellerth, the Court concluded that there was no tangible employment action because the supervisor never carried out his threats of job harm. Ellerth could still proceed with her claim of harassment, but the claim was properly �categorized as a hostile work environment claim which requires a showing of severe or pervasive conduct.� 118 S. Ct. at 2265.
When harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, the employer cannot raise the affirmative defense. This sort of claim is analyzed like any other case in which a challenged employment action is alleged to be discriminatory. If the employer produces evidence of a non-discriminatory explanation for the tangible employment action, a determination must be made whether that explanation is a pretext designed to hide a discriminatory motive.
For example, if an employee alleged that she was demoted because she refused her supervisor�s sexual advances, a determination would have to be made whether the demotion was because of her response to the advances, and hence because of her sex. Similarly, if an employee alleges that he was discharged after being subjected to severe or pervasive harassment by his supervisor based on his national origin, a determination would have to be made whether the discharge was because of the employee�s national origin.
A strong inference of discrimination will arise whenever a harassing supervisor undertakes or has significant input into a tangible employment action affecting the victim,38 because it can be �assume[d] that the harasser...could not act as an objective, non-discriminatory decision maker with respect to the plaintiff.�39 However, if the employer produces evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for the action, the employee will have to prove that the asserted reason was a pretext designed to hide the true discriminatory motive.
If it is determined that the tangible action was based on a discriminatory reason linked to the preceding harassment, relief could be sought for the entire pattern of misconduct culminating in the tangible employment action, and no affirmative defense is available.40 However, the harassment preceding the tangible employment action must be severe or pervasive in order to be actionable.31 If the tangible employment action was based on a non-discriminatory motive, then the employer would have an opportunity to raise the affirmative defense to a claim based on the preceding harassment.42
When harassment by a supervisor creates an unlawful hostile environment but does not result in a tangible employment action, the employer can raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, which it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence. The defense consists of two necessary elements:
the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.
If an employer can prove that it discharged its duty of reasonable care and that the employee could have avoided all of the harm but unreasonably failed to do so, the employer will avoid all liability for unlawful harassment.43 For example, if an employee was subjected to a pattern of disability-based harassment that created an unlawful hostile environment, but the employee unreasonably failed to complain to management before she suffered emotional harm and the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct the harassment, then the employer will avoid all liability.
If an employer cannot prove that it discharged its duty of reasonable care and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid the harm, the employer will be liable. For example, if unlawful harassment by a supervisor occurred and the employer failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent it, the employer will be liable even if the employee unreasonably failed to complain to management or even if the employer took prompt and appropriate corrective action when it gained notice.44
In most circumstances, if employers and employees discharge their respective duties of reasonable care, unlawful harassment will be prevented and there will be no reason to consider questions of liability. An effective complaint procedure �encourages employees to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive,�45 and if an employee promptly utilizes that procedure, the employer can usually stop the harassment before actionable harm occurs.46
In some circumstances, however, unlawful harassment will occur and harm will result despite the exercise of requisite legal care by the employer and employee. For example, if an employee�s supervisor directed frequent, egregious racial epithets at him that caused emotional harm virtually from the outset, and the employee promptly complained, corrective action by the employer could prevent further harm but might not correct the actionable harm that the employee already had suffered.47 Alternatively, if an employee complained about harassment before it became severe or pervasive, remedial measures undertaken by the employer might fail to stop the harassment before it reaches an actionable level, even if those measures are reasonably calculated to halt it. In these circumstances, the employer will be liable because the defense requires proof that it exercised reasonable legal care and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid the harm. While a notice-based negligence standard would absolve the employer of liability, the standard set forth in Ellerth and Faragher does not. As the Court explained, vicarious liability sets a �more stringent standard� for the employer than the �minimum standard� of negligence theory.48
While this result may seem harsh to a law abiding employer, it is consistent with liability standards under the anti-discrimination statutes which generally make employers responsible for the discriminatory acts of their supervisors.49 If, for example, a supervisor rejects a candidate for promotion because of national origin-based bias, the employer will be liable regardless of whether the employee complained to higher management and regardless of whether higher management had any knowledge about the supervisor�s motivation.50 Harassment is the only type of discrimination carried out by a supervisor for which an employer can avoid liability, and that limitation must be construed narrowly. The employer will be shielded from liability for harassment by a supervisor only if it proves that it exercised reasonable care in preventing and correcting the harassment and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid all of the harm. If both parties exercise reasonable care, the defense will fail.
establish the affirmative defense as a means to limit damages.51 The defense only limits damages where the employee reasonably could have avoided some but not all of the harm from the harassment. In the example above, in which the supervisor used frequent, egregious racial epithets, an unreasonable delay by the employee in complaining could limit damages but not eliminate liability entirely. This is because a reasonably prompt complaint would have reduced, but not eliminated, the actionable harm.52
The first prong of the affirmative defense requires a showing by the employer that it undertook reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassment. Such reasonable care generally requires an employer to establish, disseminate, and enforce an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure and to take other reasonable steps to prevent and correct harassment. The steps described below are not mandatory requirements - - whether or not an employer can prove that it exercised reasonable care depends on the particular factual circumstances and, in some cases, the nature of the employer�s workforce. Small employers may be able to effectively prevent and correct harassment through informal means, while larger employers may have to institute more formal mechanisms.53
There are no �safe harbors� for employers based on the written content of policies and procedures. Even the best policy and complaint procedure will not alone satisfy the burden of proving reasonable care if, in the particular circumstances of a claim, the employer failed to implement its process effectively.54 If, for example, the employer has an adequate policy and complaint procedure and properly responded to an employee�s complaint of harassment, but management ignored previous complaints by other employees about the same harasser, then the employer has not exercised reasonable care in preventing the harassment.55 Similarly, if the employer has an adequate policy and complaint procedure but an official failed to carry out his or her responsibility to conduct an effective investigation of a harassment complaint, the employer has not discharged its duty to exercise reasonable care. Alternatively, lack of a formal policy and complaint procedure will not defeat the defense if the employer exercised sufficient care through other means.
It generally is necessary for employers to establish, publicize, and enforce anti-harassment policies and complaint procedures. As the Supreme Court stated, �Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of anti-harassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms.� Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2270. While the Court noted that this �is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law,�56 failure to do so will make it difficult for an employer to prove that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct harassment.57 (See section V(C)(3), below, for discussion of preventive and corrective measures by small businesses.)
An employer should provide every employee with a copy of the policy and complaint procedure, and redistribute it periodically. The policy and complaint procedure should be written in a way that will be understood by all employees in the employer�s workforce. Other measures to ensure effective dissemination of the policy and complaint procedure include posting them in central locations and incorporating them into employee handbooks. If feasible, the employer should provide training to all employees to ensure that they understand their rights and responsibilities.
Assurance that employees who make complaints of harassment or provide information related to such complaints will be protected against retaliation;
Assurance that the employer will protect the confidentiality of harassment complaints to the extent possible;
Assurance that the employer will take immediate and appropriate corrective action when it determines that harassment has occurred.
An employer�s policy should make clear that it will not tolerate harassment based on sex (with or without sexual conduct), race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, and protected activity (i.e., opposition to prohibited discrimination or participation in the statutory complaint process). This prohibition should cover harassment by anyone in the workplace � supervisors, co-workers or non-employees.58 Management should convey the seriousness of the prohibition. One way to do that is for the mandate to �come from the top,� i.e., from upper management.
The policy should encourage employees to report harassment before it becomes severe or pervasive. While isolated incidents of harassment generally do not violate federal law, a pattern of such incidents may be unlawful. Therefore, to discharge its duty of preventive care, the employer must make clear to employees that it will stop harassment before it rises to the level of a violation of federal law.
An employer should make clear that it will not tolerate adverse treatment of employees because they report harassment or provide information related to such complaints. An anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure will not be effective without such an assurance.59
Management should undertake whatever measures are necessary to ensure that retaliation does not occur. For example, when management investigates a complaint of harassment, the official who interviews the parties and witnesses should remind these individuals about the prohibition against retaliation. Management also should scrutinize employment decisions affecting the complainant and witnesses during and after the investigation to ensure that such decisions are not based on retaliatory motives.
An employer�s harassment complaint procedure should be designed to encourage victims to come forward. To that end, it should clearly explain the process and ensure that there are no unreasonable obstacles to complaints. A complaint procedure should not be rigid, since that could defeat the goal of preventing and correcting harassment. When an employee complains to management about alleged harassment, the employer is obligated to investigate the allegation regardless of whether it conforms to a particular format or is made in writing.
The complaint procedure should provide accessible points of contact for the initial complaint.60 A complaint process is not effective if employees are always required to complain first to their supervisors about alleged harassment, since the supervisor may be a harasser.61 Moreover, reasonable care in preventing and correcting harassment requires an employer to instruct all supervisors to report complaints of harassment to appropriate officials.62
It is advisable for an employer to designate at least one official outside an employee�s chain of command to take complaints of harassment. For example, if the employer has an office of human resources, one or more officials in that office could be authorized to take complaints. Allowing an employee to bypass his or her chain of command provides additional assurance that the complaint will be handled in an impartial manner, since an employee who reports harassment by his or her supervisor may feel that officials within the chain of command will more readily believe the supervisor�s version of events.
It also is important for an employer�s anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure to contain information about the time frames for filing charges of unlawful harassment with the EEOC or state fair employment practice agencies and to explain that the deadline runs from the last date of unlawful harassment, not from the date that the complaint to the employer is resolved.63 While a prompt complaint process should make it feasible for an employee to delay deciding whether to file a charge until the complaint to the employer is resolved, he or she is not required to do so.64
An employer should make clear to employees that it will protect the confidentiality of harassment allegations to the extent possible. An employer cannot guarantee complete confidentiality, since it cannot conduct an effective investigation without revealing certain information to the alleged harasser and potential witnesses. However, information about the allegation of harassment should be shared only with those who need to know about it. Records relating to harassment complaints should be kept confidential on the same basis.65
A conflict between an employee�s desire for confidentiality and the employer�s duty to investigate may arise if an employee informs a supervisor about alleged harassment, but asks him or her to keep the matter confidential and take no action. Inaction by the supervisor in such circumstances could lead to employer liability. While it may seem reasonable to let the employee determine whether to pursue a complaint, the employer must discharge its duty to prevent and correct harassment.66 One mechanism to help avoid such conflicts would be for the employer to set up an informational phone line which employees can use to discuss questions or concerns about harassment on an anonymous basis.67
An employer should set up a mechanism for a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation into alleged harassment. As soon as management learns about alleged harassment, it should determine whether a detailed fact-finding investigation is necessary. For example, if the alleged harasser does not deny the accusation, there would be no need to interview witnesses, and the employer could immediately determine appropriate corrective action.
If a fact-finding investigation is necessary, it should be launched immediately. The amount of time that it will take to complete the investigation will depend on the particular circumstances.68 If, for example, multiple individuals were allegedly harassed, then it will take longer to interview the parties and witnesses.
It may be necessary to undertake intermediate measures before completing the investigation to ensure that further harassment does not occur. Examples of such measures are making scheduling changes so as to avoid contact between the parties; transferring the alleged harasser; or placing the alleged harasser on non-disciplinary leave with pay pending the conclusion of the investigation. The complainant should not be involuntarily transferred or otherwise burdened, since such measures could constitute unlawful retaliation.
The employer should ensure that the individual who conducts the investigation will objectively gather and consider the relevant facts. The alleged harasser should not have supervisory authority over the individual who conducts the investigation and should not have any direct or indirect control over the investigation. Whoever conducts the investigation should be well-trained in the skills that are required for interviewing witnesses and evaluating credibility.
When detailed fact-finding is necessary, the investigator should interview the complainant, the alleged harasser, and third parties who could reasonably be expected to have relevant information. Information relating to the personal lives of the parties outside the workplace would be relevant only in unusual circumstances. When interviewing the parties and witnesses, the investigator should refrain from offering his or her opinion.
The following are examples of questions that may be appropriate to ask the parties and potential witnesses. Any actual investigation must be tailored to the particular facts.
Who, what, when, where, and how: Who committed the alleged harassment? What exactly occurred or was said? When did it occur and is it still ongoing? Where did it occur? How often did it occur? How did it affect you?
Are there any persons who have relevant information? Was anyone present when the alleged harassment occurred? Did you tell anyone about it? Did anyone see you immediately after episodes of alleged harassment?
Did the person who harassed you harass anyone else? Do you know whether anyone complained about harassment by that person?
What did you see or hear? When did this occur? Describe the alleged harasser�s behavior toward the complainant and toward others in the workplace.
If there are conflicting versions of relevant events, the employer will have to weigh each party�s credibility. Credibility assessments can be critical in determining whether the alleged harassment in fact occurred. Factors to consider include:
Corroboration: Is there witness testimony (such as testimony by eye-witnesses, people who saw the person soon after the alleged incidents, or people who discussed the incidents with him or her at around the time that they occurred) or physical evidence (such as written documentation) that corroborates the party�s testimony?
None of the above factors are determinative as to credibility. For example, the fact that there are no eye-witnesses to the alleged harassment by no means necessarily defeats the complainant�s credibility, since harassment often occurs behind closed doors. Furthermore, the fact that the alleged harasser engaged in similar behavior in the past does not necessarily mean that he or she did so again.
Once all of the evidence is in, interviews are finalized, and credibility issues are resolved, management should make a determination as to whether harassment occurred. That determination could be made by the investigator, or by a management official who reviews the investigator�s report. The parties should be informed of the determination.
In some circumstances, it may be difficult for management to reach a determination because of direct contradictions between the parties and a lack of documentary or eye-witness corroboration. In such cases, a credibility assessment may form the basis for a determination, based on factors such as those set forth above.
If no determination can be made because the evidence is inconclusive, the employer should still undertake further preventive measures, such as training and monitoring.
An employer should make clear that it will undertake immediate and appropriate corrective action, including discipline, whenever it determines that harassment has occurred in violation of the employer�s policy. Management should inform both parties about these measures.69
Remedial measures should be designed to stop the harassment, correct its effects on the employee, and ensure that the harassment does not recur. These remedial measures need not be those that the employee requests or prefers, as long as they are effective.
In determining disciplinary measures, management should keep in mind that the employer could be found liable if the harassment does not stop. At the same time, management may have concerns that overly punitive measures may subject the employer to claims such as wrongful discharge, and may simply be inappropriate.
To balance the competing concerns, disciplinary measures should be proportional to the seriousness of the offense.70 If the harassment was minor, such as a small number of �off-color� remarks by an individual with no prior history of similar misconduct, then counseling and an oral warning might be all that is necessary. On the other hand, if the harassment was severe or persistent, then suspension or discharge may be appropriate.71
Remedial measures should not adversely affect the complainant. Thus, for example, if it is necessary to separate the parties, then the harasser should be transferred (unless the complainant prefers otherwise).72 Remedial responses that penalize the complainant could constitute unlawful retaliation and are not effective in correcting the harassment.73
Remedial measures also should correct the effects of the harassment. Such measures should be designed to put the employee in the position s/he would have been in had the misconduct not occurred.
training or counseling of harasser to ensure that s/he understands why his or her conduct violated the employer�s anti-harassment policy; and
monitoring treatment of employee to ensure that s/he is not subjected to retaliation by the harasser or others in the work place because of the complaint; and
An employer�s responsibility to exercise reasonable care to prevent and correct harassment is not limited to implementing an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure. As the Supreme Court stated, �the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by common workers; employers have greater opportunity and incentive to screen them, train them, and monitor their performance.� Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2291.
An employer�s duty to exercise due care includes instructing all of its supervisors and managers to address or report to appropriate officials complaints of harassment regardless of whether they are officially designated to take complaints75 and regardless of whether a complaint was framed in a way that conforms to the organization�s particular complaint procedures.76 For example, if an employee files an EEOC charge alleging unlawful harassment, the employer should launch an internal investigation even if the employee did not complain to management through its internal complaint process.
Furthermore, due care requires management to correct harassment regardless of whether an employee files an internal complaint, if the conduct is clearly unwelcome. For example, if there are areas in the workplace with graffiti containing racial or sexual epithets, management should eliminate the graffiti and not wait for an internal complaint.77
An employer should ensure that its supervisors and managers understand their responsibilities under the organization�s anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure. Periodic training of those individuals can help achieve that result. Such training should explain the types of conduct that violate the employer�s anti-harassment policy; the seriousness of the policy; the responsibilities of supervisors and managers when they learn of alleged harassment; and the prohibition against retaliation.
An employer should keep track of its supervisors� and managers� conduct to make sure that they carry out their responsibilities under the organization�s anti-harassment program.78 For example, an employer could include such compliance in formal evaluations.
Reasonable preventive measures include screening applicants for supervisory jobs to see if any have a record of engaging in harassment. If so, it may be necessary for the employer to reject a candidate on that basis or to take additional steps to prevent harassment by that individual.
Finally, it is advisable for an employer to keep records of all complaints of harassment. Without such records, the employer could be unaware of a pattern of harassment by the same individual. Such a pattern would be relevant to credibility assessments and disciplinary measures.79
It may not be necessary for an employer of a small workforce to implement the type of formal complaint process described above. If it puts into place an effective, informal mechanism to prevent and correct harassment, a small employer could still satisfy the first prong of the affirmative defense to a claim of harassment.80 As the Court recognized in Faragher, an employer of a small workforce might informally exercise sufficient care to prevent harassment.81
For example, such an employer�s failure to disseminate a written policy against harassment on protected bases would not undermine the affirmative defense if it effectively communicated the prohibition and an effective complaint procedure to all employees at staff meetings. An owner of a small business who regularly meets with all of his or her employees might tell them at monthly staff meetings that he or she will not tolerate harassment and that anyone who experiences harassment should bring it �straight to the top.�
If a complaint is made, the business, like any other employer, must conduct a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation and undertake swift and appropriate corrective action where appropriate. The questions set forth in Section V(C)(1)(e)(i), above, can help guide the inquiry and the factors set forth in Section V(C)(1)(e)(ii) should be considered in evaluating the credibility of each of the parties.
The second prong of the affirmative defense requires a showing by the employer that the aggrieved employee �unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.� Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2293; Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2270.
This element of the defense arises from the general theory �that a victim has a duty �to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages� that result from violations of the statute.� Faragher, 18 S. Ct. at 2292, quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219, 231 n.15 (1982). Thus an employer who exercised reasonable care as described in subsection V(C), above, is not liable for unlawful harassment if the aggrieved employee could have avoided all of the actionable harm. If some but not all of the harm could have been avoided, then an award of damages will be mitigated accordingly.82
A complaint by an employee does not automatically defeat the employer�s affirmative defense. If, for example, the employee provided no information to support his or her allegation, gave untruthful information, or otherwise failed to cooperate in the investigation, the complaint would not qualify as an effort to avoid harm. Furthermore, if the employee unreasonably delayed complaining, and an earlier complaint could have reduced the harm, then the affirmative defense could operate to reduce damages.
Proof that the employee unreasonably failed to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer will normally satisfy the employer�s burden.83 However, it is important to emphasize that an employee who failed to complain does not carry a burden of proving the reasonableness of that decision. Rather, the burden lies with the employer to prove that the employee�s failure to complain was unreasonable.
A determination as to whether an employee unreasonably failed to complain or otherwise avoid harm depends on the particular circumstances and information available to the employee at that time.84 An employee should not necessarily be expected to complain to management immediately after the first or second incident of relatively minor harassment. Workplaces need not become battlegrounds where every minor, unwelcome remark based on race, sex, or another protected category triggers a complaint and investigation. An employee might reasonably ignore a small number of incidents, hoping that the harassment will stop without resort to the complaint process.85 The employee may directly say to the harasser that s/he wants the misconduct to stop, and then wait to see if that is effective in ending the harassment before complaining to management. If the harassment persists, however, then further delay in complaining might be found unreasonable.
There might be other reasonable explanations for an employee�s delay in complaining or entire failure to utilize the employer�s complaint process. For example, the employee might have had reason to believe that:86
To establish the second prong of the affirmative defense, the employer must prove that the belief or perception underlying the employee�s failure to complain was unreasonable.
An employer cannot establish that an employee unreasonably failed to use its complaint procedure if that employee reasonably feared retaliation. Surveys have shown that employees who are subjected to harassment frequently do not complain to management due to fear of retaliation.87 To assure employees that such a fear is unwarranted, the employer must clearly communicate and enforce a policy that no employee will be retaliated against for complaining of harassment.
An employee�s failure to use the employer�s complaint procedure would be reasonable if that failure was based on unnecessary obstacles to complaints. For example, if the process entailed undue expense by the employee,88 inaccessible points of contact for making complaints,89 or unnecessarily intimidating or burdensome requirements, failure to invoke it on such a basis would be reasonable.
An employee�s failure to participate in a mandatory mediation or other alternative dispute resolution process also does not does not constitute unreasonable failure to avoid harm. While an employee can be expected to cooperate in the employer�s investigation by providing relevant information, an employee can never be required to waive rights, either substantive or procedural, as an element of his or her exercise of reasonable care.90 Nor must an employee have to try to resolve the matter with the harasser as an element of exercising due care.
An employer cannot establish the second prong of the defense based on the employee�s failure to complain if that failure was based on a reasonable belief that the process was ineffective. For example, an employee would have a reasonable basis to believe that the complaint process is ineffective if the procedure required the employee to complain initially to the harassing supervisor. Such a reasonable basis also would be found if he or she was aware of instances in which co-workers� complaints failed to stop harassment. One way to increase employees� confidence in the efficacy of the complaint process would be for the employer to release general information to employees about corrective and disciplinary measures undertaken to stop harassment.91
Generally, an employer can prove the second prong of the affirmative defense if the employee unreasonably failed to utilize its complaint process. However, such proof will not establish the defense if the employee made other efforts to avoid harm.
For example, a prompt complaint by the employee to the EEOC or a state fair employment practices agency while the harassment is ongoing could qualify as such an effort. A union grievance could also qualify as an effort to avoid harm.92 Similarly, a staffing firm worker who is harassed at the client�s workplace might report the harassment either to the staffing firm or to the client, reasonably expecting that either would act to correct the problem.93 Thus the worker�s failure to complain to one of those entities would not bar him or her from subsequently bringing a claim against it.
With these and any other efforts to avoid harm, the timing of the complaint could affect liability or damages. If the employee could have avoided some of the harm by complaining earlier, then damages would be mitigated accordingly.
An employer is liable for unlawful harassment whenever the harasser is of a sufficiently high rank to fall �within that class . . . who may be treated as the organization�s proxy.� Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2284.94 In such circumstances, the official�s unlawful harassment is imputed automatically to the employer.95 Thus the employer cannot raise the affirmative defense, even if the harassment did not result in a tangible employment action.
The Court, in Faragher, cited the following examples of officials whose harassment could be imputed automatically to the employer:
The Supreme Court�s rulings in Ellerth and Faragher create an incentive for employers to implement and enforce strong policies prohibiting harassment and effective complaint procedures. The rulings also create an incentive for employees to alert management about harassment before it becomes severe and pervasive. If employers and employees undertake these steps, unlawful harassment can often be prevented, thereby effectuating an important goal of the anti-discrimination statutes.
1 See, e.g., 29 C.F.R. � 1604.11 n. 1 (�The principles involved here continue to apply to race, color, religion or national origin.�); EEOC Compliance Manual Section 615.11(a) (BNA 615:0025 (�Title VII law and agency principles will guide the determination of whether an employer is liable for age harassment by its supervisors, employees, or non-employees�).
2 See 1980 Guidelines at 29 C.F.R. � 1604.11(f) and Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, Section E, 8 FEP Manual 405:6699 (Mar. 19, 1990), quoted in Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2292.
5 Faragher, 118 S.Ct. at 2283. However, when isolated incidents that are not �extremely serious� come to the attention of management, appropriate corrective action should still be taken so that they do not escalate. See Section V(C)(1)(a), below.
7 Some previous Commission documents classified harassment as either �quid pro quo� or hostile environment. However, it is now more useful to distinguish between harassment that results in a tangible employment action and harassment that creates a hostile work environment, since that dichotomy determines whether the employer can raise the affirmative defense to vicarious liability. Guidance on the definition of �tangible employment action� appears in section IV(B), below.
8 The guidance in this document applies to federal sector employers, as well as all other employers covered by the statutes enforced by the Commission.
10 The Commission will rescind Subsection 1604.11(c) of the 1980 Guidelines on Sexual Harassment, 29 CFR � 1604.11(c). In addition, the following Commission guidance is no longer in effect: Subsection D of the 1990 Policy Statement on Current Issues in Sexual Harassment(�Employer Liability for Harassment by Supervisors�), EEOC Compliance Manual (BNA) N:4050-58 (3/19/90); and EEOC Compliance Manual Section 615.3(c) (BNA) 6:15-0007 - 0008.
The remaining portions of the 1980 Guidelines, the 1990 Policy Statement, and Section 615 of the Compliance Manual remain in effect. Other Commission guidance on harassment also remains in effect, including the Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., EEOC Compliance Manual (BNA) N:4071 (3/8/94) and the Policy Guidance on Employer Liability for Sexual Favoritism, EEOC Compliance Manual (BNA) N:5051 (3/19/90).
11 Harassment that is targeted at an individual because of his or her sex violates Title VII even if it does not involve sexual comments or conduct. Thus, for example, frequent, derogatory remarks about women could constitute unlawful harassment even if the remarks are not sexual in nature. See 1990 Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, subsection C(4) (�sex-based harassment - that is, harassment not involving sexual activity or language - may also give rise to Title VII liability . . . if it is �sufficiently patterned or pervasive� and directed at employees because of their sex�).
12 �Protected activity� means opposition to discrimination or participation in proceedings covered by the anti-discrimination statutes. Harassment based on protected activity can constitute unlawful retaliation. See EEOC Compliance Manual Section 8 (�Retaliation�) (BNA) 614:001 (May 20, 1998).
13 For cases applying Ellerth and Faragher to harassment on different bases, see Hafford v. Seidner, 167 F.3d 1074, 1080 (6th Cir. 1999) (religion and race); Breeding v. Arthur J. Gallagher and Co., 164 F.3d 1151, 1158 (8th Cir. 1999) (age); Allen v. Michigan Department of Corrections, 165 F.3d 405, 411 (6th Cir. 1999) (race) ; Richmond-Hopes v. City of Cleveland, No. 97-3595, 1998 WL 808222 at *9 (6th Cir. Nov. 16, 1998) (unpublished) (retaliation); Wright-Simmons v. City of Oklahoma City, 155 F.3d 1264, 1270 (10th Cir. 1998) (race); Gotfryd v. Book Covers, Inc., No. 97 C 7696, 1999 WL 20925 at *5 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 7, 1999) (national origin). See also Wallin v. Minnesota Department of Corrections, 153 F.3d 681, 687 (8th Cir. 1998) (assuming without deciding that ADA hostile environment claims are modeled after Title VII claims), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1141 (1999).
14 The majority�s analysis in both Faragher and Ellerth drew upon the liability standards for harassment on other protected bases. It is therefore clear that the same standards apply. See Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2283 (in determining appropriate standard of liability for sexual harassment by supervisors, Court �drew upon cases recognizing liability for discriminatory harassment based on race and national origin�); Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2268 (Court imported concept of �tangible employment action� in race, age and national origin discrimination cases for resolution of vicarious liability in sexual harassment cases). See also cases cited in n.13, above.
16 Numerous statutes contain the word "supervisor," and some contain definitions of the term. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. � 1813(r) (definition of "State bank supervisor" in legislation regarding Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation); 29 U.S.C. � 152(11) (definition of "supervisor" in National Labor Relations Act); 42 U.S.C.. � 8262(2) (definition of "facility energy supervisor" in Federal Energy Initiative legislation). The definitions vary depending on the purpose and structure of each statute. The definition of the word �supervisor� under other statutes does not control, and is not affected by, the meaning of that term under the employment discrimination statutes.
17 See 42 U.S.C. 2000e(a) (Title VII); 29 U.S.C. 630(b) (ADEA); and 42 U.S.C. �12111(5)(A) (ADA) (all defining �employer� as including any agent of the employer).
18 Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 72 (1986); Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2290 n.3; Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2266.
19 See Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2288 (analysis of vicarious liability �calls not for a mechanical application of indefinite and malleable factors set forth in the Restatement . . . but rather an inquiry into the reasons that would support a conclusion that harassing behavior ought to be held within the scope of a supervisor�s employment . . . �) and at 2290 n.3 (agency concepts must be adapted to the practical objectives of the anti-discrimination statutes).
23 Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2280. For a more detailed discussion of the harassers� job responsibilities, see Faragher, 864 F. Supp. 1552, 1563 (S.D. Fla. 1994).
24 See Grozdanich v. Leisure Hills Health Center, 25 F. Supp.2d 953, 973 (D. Minn. 1998) (�it is evident that the Supreme Court views the term �supervisor� as more expansive than as merely including those employees whose opinions are dispositive on hiring, firing, and promotion�; thus, �charge nurse� who had authority to control plaintiff�s daily activities and recommend discipline qualified as �supervisor� and therefore rendered employer vicariously liable under Title VII for his harassment of plaintiff, subject to affirmative defense).
25 See Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2268 (�If, in the unusual case, it is alleged there is a false impression that the actor was a supervisor, when he in fact was not, the victim�s mistaken conclusion must be a reasonable one.�); Llampallas v. Mini-Circuit Lab, Inc., 163 F.3d 1236, 1247 (11th Cir. 1998) (�Although the employer may argue that the employee had no actual authority to take the employment action against the plaintiff, apparent authority serves just as well to impute liability to the employer for the employee's action.�).
26 Of course, traditional principles of mitigation of damages apply in these cases, as well as all other employment discrimination cases. See generally Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219 (1982).
27 Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2269; Faragher, 118 S. Ct. 2284-85. See also Durham Life Insurance Co., v. Evans, 166 F.3d 139, 152 (3rd Cir. 1999) (�A supervisor can only take a tangible adverse employment action because of the authority delegated by the employer . . . and thus the employer is properly charged with the consequences of that delegation.�).
30 All listed examples are set forth in Ellerth and/or Faragher. See Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2268 and 2270; Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2284, 2291, and 2293.
31 Other forms of formal discipline would qualify as well, such as suspension. Any disciplinary action undertaken as part of a program of progressive discipline is �tangible� because it brings the employee one step closer to discharge.
32 The Commission disagrees with the Fourth Circuit�s conclusion in Reinhold v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 151 F.3d 172 (4th Cir. 1998), that the plaintiff was not subjected to a tangible employment action where the harassing supervisor �dramatically increased her workload,� Reinhold, 947 F. Supp. 919, 923 (E.D Va. 1996), denied her the opportunity to attend a professional conference, required her to monitor and discipline a co-worker, and generally gave her undesirable assignments. The Fourth Circuit ruled that the plaintiff had not been subjected to a tangible employment action because she had not �experienced a change in her employment status akin to a demotion or a reassignment entailing significantly different job responsibilities.� 151 F.3d at 175. It is the Commission�s view that the Fourth Circuit misconstrued Faragher and Ellerth. While minor changes in work assignments would not rise to the level of tangible job harm, the actions of the supervisor in Reinhold were substantial enough to significantly alter the plaintiff�s employment status.
33 See Durham, 166 F.3d at 152-53 (assigning insurance salesperson heavy load of inactive policies, which had a severe negative impact on her earnings, and depriving her of her private office and secretary, were tangible employment actions); Bryson v. Chicago State University, 96 F.3d 912, 917 (7th Cir. 1996) (�Depriving someone of the building blocks for . . . a promotion . . . is just as serious as depriving her of the job itself.�).

Gas Research Institute, 31 F.3d 451, 457 (7th Cir. 1994) (change in reporting relationship requiring plaintiff to report to former subordinate, while maybe bruising plaintiff�s ego, did not affect his salary, benefits, and level of responsibility and therefore could not be challenged in ADEA claim), cited in Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2269.
35 See Crady v. Liberty Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Ind., 993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir. 1993) (�A materially adverse change might be indicated by a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices that might be unique to the particular situation.�), quoted in Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2268-69.
36 See Nichols v. Frank, 42 F.3d 503, 512-13 (9th Cir. 1994) (employer vicariously liable where its supervisor granted plaintiff�s leave requests based on her submission to sexual conduct), cited in Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2285.
37 See Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2268 and Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2284 (listed examples of tangible employment actions that included both positive and negative job decisions: hiring and firing; promotion and failure to promote).
38 The link could be established even if the harasser was not the ultimate decision maker. See, e.g., Shager v Upjohn Co., 913 F.2d 398, 405 (7th Cir. 1990) (noting that committee rather than the supervisor fired plaintiff, but employer was still liable because committee functioned as supervisor�s �cat�s paw�), cited in Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2269.
40 Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2270 (�[n]o affirmative defense is available . . . when the supervisor�s harassment culminates in a tangible employment action . . .�); Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2293 (same). See also Durham, 166 F.3d at 154 (�When harassment becomes adverse employment action, the employer loses the affirmative defense, even if it might have been available before.�); Lissau v. Southern Food Services, Inc., 159 F.3d 177, 184 (4th Cir. 1998) (the affirmative defense �is not available in a hostile work environment case when the supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the employee as part of the harassment�) (Michael, J., concurring).
41 Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2265. Even if the preceding acts were not severe or pervasive, they still may be relevant evidence in determining whether the tangible employment action was discriminatory.
42 See Lissau v. Southern Food Service, Inc., 159 F.3d at 182 (if plaintiff could not prove that her discharge resulted from her refusal to submit to her supervisor�s sexual harassment, then the defendant could advance the affirmative defense); Newton v. Caldwell Laboratories, 156 F.3d 880, 883 (8th Cir. 1998) (plaintiff failed to prove that her rejection of her supervisor�s sexual advances was the reason that her request for a transfer was denied and that she was discharged; her claim was therefore categorized as one of hostile environment harassment); Fierro v. Saks Fifth Avenue, 13 F. Supp.2d 481, 491 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (plaintiff claimed that his discharge resulted from national origin harassment but court found that he was discharged because of embezzlement; thus, employer could raise affirmative defense as to the harassment preceding the discharge).
43 See Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2292 (�If the victim could have avoided harm, no liability should be found against the employer who had taken reasonable care.�).
44 See, e.g., EEOC v. SBS Transit, Inc., No. 97-4164, 1998 WL 903833 at *1 (6th Cir. Dec. 18, 1998) (unpublished) (lower court erred when it reasoned that employer liability for sexual harassment is negated if the employer responds adequately and effectively once it has notice of the supervisor�s harassment; that standard conflicts with affirmative defense which requires proof that employer �took reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior and that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer�).
46 See Indest v. Freeman Decorating, Inc., 168 F.3d 795, 803 (5th Cir. 1999) (�when an employer satisfies the first element of the Supreme Court�s affirmative defense, it will likely forestall its own vicarious liability for a supervisor�s discriminatory conduct by nipping such behavior in the bud�) (Wiener, J., concurring in Indest, 164 F.3d 258 (5th Cir. 1999)). The Commission agrees with Judge Wiener�s concurrence in Indest that the court in that case dismissed the plaintiff�s claims on an erroneous basis. The plaintiff alleged that her supervisor made five crude sexual comments or gestures to her during a week-long convention. She reported the incidents to appropriate management officials who investigated the matter and meted out appropriate discipline. No further incidents of harassment occurred. The court noted that it was �difficult to conclude� that the conduct to which the plaintiff was briefly subjected created an unlawful hostile environment. Nevertheless, the court went on to consider liability. It stated that Ellerth and Faragher do not apply where the plaintiff quickly resorted to the employer�s grievance procedure and the employer took prompt remedial action. In such a case, according to the court, the employer�s quick response exempts it from liability. The Commission agrees with Judge Wiener that Ellerth and Faragher do control the analysis in such cases, and that an employee�s prompt complaint to management forecloses the employer from proving the affirmative defense. However, as Judge Wiener pointed out, an employer�s quick remedial action will often thwart the creation of an unlawful hostile environment, rendering any consideration of employer liability unnecessary.
47 See Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (in order for defendant to avoid all liability for sexual harassment leading to rape of plaintiff �it must show not merely that [the plaintiff] inexcusably delayed reporting the alleged rape . . . but that, as a matter of law, a reasonable person in [her] place would have come forward early enough to prevent [the] harassment from becoming �severe or pervasive��).
49 Under this same principle, it is the Commission�s position that an employer is liable for punitive damages if its supervisor commits unlawful harassment or other discriminatory conduct with malice or with reckless indifference to the employee�s federally protected rights. (The Supreme Court will determine the standard for awarding punitive damages in Kolstad v. American Dental Association,119 S. Ct. 401 (1998) (granting certiorari).) The test for imposition of punitive damages is the mental state of the harasser, not of higher-level officials. This approach furthers the remedial and deterrent objectives of the anti-discrimination statutes, and is consistent with the vicarious liability standard set forth in Faragher and Ellerth.
50 Even if higher management proves that evidence it discovered after-the-fact would have justified the supervisor�s action, such evidence can only limit remedies, not eliminate liability. McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U.S. 352, 360-62 (1995).
51 See Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2293, and Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2270 (affirmative defense operates either to eliminate liability or limit damages).
52 See Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2292 (�if damages could reasonably have been mitigated no award against a liable employer should reward a plaintiff for what her own efforts could have avoided�).
54 See Hurley v. Atlantic City Police Dept., No. 96-5634, 96-5633, 96-5661, 96-5738, 1999 WL 150301 (3d Cir. March 18, 1999) (�Ellerth and Faragher do not, as the defendants seem to assume, focus mechanically on the formal existence of a sexual harassment policy, allowing an absolute defense to a hostile work environment claim whenever the employer can point to an anti-harassment policy of some sort�; defendant failed to prove affirmative defense where it issued written policies without enforcing them, painted over offensive graffiti every few months only to see it go up again in minutes, and failed to investigate sexual harassment as it investigated and punished other forms of misconduct.).
55 See Dees v. Johnson Controls World Services, Inc., 168 F.3d 417, 422 (11th Cir. 1999) (employer can be held liable despite its immediate and appropriate corrective action in response to harassment complaint if it had knowledge of the harassment prior to the complaint and took no corrective action).
57 A union grievance and arbitration system does not fulfill this obligation. Decision making under such a system addresses the collective interests of bargaining unit members, while decision making under an internal harassment complaint process should focus on the individual complainant�s rights under the employer�s anti-harassment policy.
An arbitration, mediation, or other alternative dispute resolution process also does not fulfill the employer�s duty of due care. The employer cannot discharge its responsibility to investigate complaints of harassment and undertake corrective measures by providing employees with a dispute resolution process. For further discussion of the impact of such procedures on the affirmative defense, see Section V(D)(1)(b), below.
Finally, a federal agency�s formal, internal EEO complaint process does not, by itself, fulfill its obligation to exercise reasonable care. That process only addresses complaints of violations of the federal EEO laws, while the Court, in Ellerth, made clear that an employer should encourage employees �to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive.� Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2270. Furthermore, the EEO process is designed to assess whether the agency is liable for unlawful discrimination and does not necessarily fulfill the agency�s obligation to undertake immediate and appropriate corrective action.
58 Although the affirmative defense does not apply in cases of harassment by co-workers or non-employees, an employer cannot claim lack of knowledge as a defense to such harassment if it did not make clear to employees that they can bring such misconduct to the attention of management and that such complaints will be addressed. See Perry v. Ethan Allen, 115 F.3d 143, 149 (2d Cir. 1997) (�When harassment is perpetrated by the plaintiff's coworkers, an employer will be liable if the plaintiff demonstrates that �the employer either provided no reasonable avenue for complaint or knew of the harassment but did nothing about it��), cited in Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2289. Furthermore, an employer is liable for harassment by a co-worker or non-employer if management knew or should have known of the misconduct, unless the employer can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. 29 C.F.R. � 1604.11(d). Therefore, the employer should have a mechanism for investigating such allegations and undertaking corrective action, where appropriate.
59 Surveys have shown that a common reason for failure to report harassment to management is fear of retaliation. See, e.g., Louise F. Fitzgerald & Suzanne Swan, �Why Didn�t She Just Report Him? The Psychological and Legal Implications of Women�s Responses to Sexual Harassment,� 51 Journal of Social Issues 117, 121-22 (1995) (citing studies). Surveys also have shown that a significant proportion of harassment victims are worse off after complaining. Id. at 123-24; see also Patricia A. Frazier, �Overview of Sexual Harassment From the Behavioral Science Perspective,� paper presented at the American Bar Association National Institute on Sexual Harassment at B-17 (1998) (reviewing studies that show frequency of retaliation after victims confront their harasser or filed formal complaints).
60 See Wilson v. Tulsa Junior College, 164 F.3d 534, 541 (10th Cir. 1998) (complaint process deficient where it permitted employees to bypass the harassing supervisor by complaining to director of personnel services, but the director was inaccessible due to hours of duty and location in separate facility).
61 Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2293 (in holding as matter of law that City did not exercise reasonable care to prevent the supervisors� harassment, Court took note of fact that City�s policy �did not include any assurance that the harassing supervisors could be bypassed in registering complaints�); Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 471 U.S. 57, 72 (1986).
62 See Wilson, 164 F.3d at 541 (complaint procedure deficient because it only required supervisors to report �formal� as opposed to �informal� complaints of harassment); Varner v. National Super Markets Inc., 94 F.3d 1209, 1213 (8th Cir. 1996), cert denied, 519 U.S. 1110 (1997) (complaint procedure is not effective if it does not require supervisor with knowledge of harassment to report the information to those in position to take appropriate action).
63 It is particularly important for federal agencies to explain the statute of limitations for filing formal EEO complaints, because the regulatory deadline is only 45 days and employees may otherwise assume they can wait whatever length of time it takes for management to complete its internal investigation.
64 If an employer actively misleads an employee into missing the deadline for filing a charge by dragging out its investigation and assuring the employee that the harassment will be rectified, then the employer would be �equitably stopped� from challenging the delay. See Currier v. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Inc., 159 F.3d 1363, 1368 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (�an employer�s affirmatively misleading statements that a grievance will be resolved in the employee�s favor can establish an equitable estoppel�); Miranda v. B & B Cash Grocery Store, Inc., 975 F.2d 1518, 1531 (11th Cir. 1992) (tolling is appropriate where plaintiff was led by defendant to believe that the discriminatory treatment would be rectified); Miller v. Beneficial Management Corp., 977 F.2d 834, 845 (3d Cir. 1992) (equitable tolling applies where employer�s own acts or omission has lulled the plaintiff into foregoing prompt attempt to vindicate his rights).
65 The sharing of records about a harassment complaint with prospective employers of the complainant could constitute unlawful retaliation. See Compliance Manual Section 8 (�Retaliation), subsection II D (2), (BNA) 614:0005 (5/20/98).
66 One court has suggested that it may be permissible to honor such a request, but that when the harassment is severe, an employer cannot just stand by, even if requested to do so. Torres v. Pisano, 116 F.3d 625 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 563(1997).
67 Employers may hesitate to set up such a phone line due to concern that it may create a duty to investigate anonymous complaints, even if based on mere rumor. To avoid any confusion as to whether an anonymous complaint through such a phone line triggers an investigation, the employer should make clear that the person who takes the calls is not a management official and can only answer questions and provide information. An investigation will proceed only if a complaint is made through the internal complaint process or if management otherwise learns about alleged harassment.
68 See, e.g., Van Zant v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 80 F.3d 708, 715 (2d Cir. 1996) (employer�s response prompt where it began investigation on the day that complaint was made, conducted interviews within two days, and fired the harasser within ten days); Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., 25 F.3d 1459, 1464 (9th Cir. 1994) (employer�s response to complaints inadequate despite eventual discharge of harasser where it did not seriously investigate or strongly reprimand supervisor until after plaintiff filed charge with state FEP agency), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1082 (1995); Saxton v. AT&T, 10 F.3d 526, 535 (7th Cir 1993) (investigation prompt where it was begun one day after complaint and a detailed report was completed two weeks later); Nash v. Electrospace Systems, Inc. 9 F.3d 401, 404 (5th Cir. 1993) (prompt investigation completed within one week); Juarez v. Ameritech Mobile Communications, Inc., 957 F.2d 317, 319 (7th Cir. 1992) (adequate investigation completed within four days).
69 Management may be reluctant to release information about specific disciplinary measures that it undertakes against the harasser, due to concerns about potential defamation claims by the harasser. However, many courts have recognized that limited disclosures of such information are privileged. For cases addressing defenses to defamation claims arising out of alleged harassment, see Duffy v. Leading Edge Products, 44 F.3d 308, 311 (5th Cir. 1995) (qualified privilege applied to statements accusing plaintiff of harassment); Garziano v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 818 F.2d 380 (5th Cir. 1987) (qualified privilege protects employer�s statements in bulletin to employees concerning dismissal of alleged harasser); Stockley v. AT&T, 687 F. Supp. 764 (F. Supp. 764 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) (statements made in course of investigation into sexual harassment charges protected by qualified privilege).
71 In some cases, accused harassers who were subjected to discipline and subsequently exonerated have claimed that the disciplinary action was discriminatory. No discrimination will be found if the employer had a good faith belief that such action was warranted and there is no evidence that it undertook less punitive measures against similarly situated employees outside his or her protected class who were accused of harassment. In such circumstances, the Commission will not find pretext based solely on an after-the-fact conclusion that the disciplinary action was inappropriate. See Waggoner v. City of Garland Tex., 987 F.2d 1160, 1165 (5th Cir. 1993) (where accused harasser claims that disciplinary action was discriminatory, �[t]he real issue is whether the employer reasonably believed the employee�s allegation [of harassment] and acted on it in good faith, or to the contrary, the employer did not actually believe the co-employee�s allegation but instead used it as a pretext for an otherwise discriminatory dismissal�).
72 See Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., 25 F.3d 1459, 1464 (9th Cir. 1994) (employer remedial action for sexual harassment by supervisor inadequate where it twice changed plaintiff�s shift to get her away from supervisor rather than change his shift or work area), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1082 (1995).
73 See Guess v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 913 F.2d 463, 465 (7th Cir. 1990) (�a remedial measure that makes the victim of sexual harassment worse off is ineffective per se�).
74 An oral warning or reprimand would be appropriate only if the misconduct was isolated and minor. If an employer relies on oral warnings or reprimands to correct harassment, it will have difficulty proving that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct such misconduct.
75 See Varner, 94 F.3d at 1213 (complaint procedure is not effective if it does not require supervisor with knowledge of harassment to report the information to those in position to take appropriate action), cert denied, 117 S. Ct. 946 (1997); accord Wilson v. Tulsa Junior College, 164 F.3d at 541.
76 See Wilson, 164 F.3d at 541 (complaint procedure deficient because it only required supervisors to report �formal� as opposed to �informal� complaints of harassment).

Shoney�s, Inc., 97 F.3d 488, 490 (11th Cir. 1996) (where harassment of plaintiffs was so pervasive that higher management could be deemed to have constructive knowledge of it, employer was obligated to undertake corrective action even though plaintiffs did not register complaints); Fall v. Indiana Univ. Bd. of Trustees, 12 F. Supp.2d 870, 882 (N.D. Ind. 1998) (employer has constructive knowledge of harassment by supervisors where it �was so broad in scope and so permeated the workplace that it must have come to the attention of someone authorized to do something about it�).
78 In Faragher, the City lost the opportunity to establish the affirmative defense in part because �its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors.� Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2293.
80 If the owner of the business commits unlawful harassment, then the business will automatically be found liable under the alter ego standard and no affirmative defense can be raised. See Section VI, below.
82 Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2292 (�If the victim could have avoided harm, no liability should be found against the employer who had taken reasonable care, and if damages could reasonably have been mitigated no award against a liable employer should reward a plaintiff for what her own efforts could have avoided.�).

Sexual harassment includes any unwanted sexual advance, request for sexual favors, or other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. (link)� The U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has noted, �harassment can be written, verbal, or other conduct, and does not require physical contact.� (link)
All persons have a right to be free of sexual harassment in the context of housing, which includes, among other things, living in their home, engaging in housing-related services, or attempting to secure housing. HUD has acknowledged that low-income women � often racial and ethnic minorities and persons with disability may be particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment in housing. (link)� Nevertheless, the sex, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation of the person being harassed does not preclude that person from the legal protections afforded by fair housing laws. For example, lesbian, gay, bisexual, heterosexual, transgender, cisgender, and gender non-conforming persons are all included under these laws.
The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing, both public and private, and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, and disability.� Courts have consistently recognized sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination that violates the Fair Housing Act. (link)� In 1989, HUD created fair housing regulations, which include examples of discriminatory housing practices related to quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile environment harassment. Specifically, these regulations identified the following as illegal conduct: (a) denying or limiting housing-related services or facilities because a person refused to provide sexual favors; and (b) interfering with persons in their enjoyment of a dwelling because of race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin of such persons, or of visitors or associates of such persons. (link)
In September of 2016, HUD issued a rule defining the terms quid pro sexual harassment and hostile environment harassment. It stated that quid pro quo harassment,
HUD defined hostile environment harassment as that which �refers to unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to interfere with: the availability, sale, rental, or use or enjoyment of a dwelling; the terms, conditions, or privileges of the sale or rental, or the provision of enjoyment of services of facilities in connection therewith; or the availability, terms or conditions of a residential real-estate related transaction.
In addition to federal protections, the Massachusetts fair housing law prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, age, ancestry, genetic information, veteran or active military status, and source of income (e.g. a housing voucher, food stamps, and Section 8) Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 151B, � 4.
Massachusetts state law prohibits any person from using threats, intimidation, or coercion to interfere with the secured rights of any other person. See Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 12 �� 11H-J.
In Massachusetts, a tenant or co-tenant may terminate a rental agreement or tenancy and leave the premises if they notify the owner that a household member is (a) a victim of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, or stalking as long as the notification is made within three months of the most recent act of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault or stalking; or (b) reasonably in fear of imminent serious physical harm from domestic violence, rape, sexual assault or stalking. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 186 �� 24(a-b). An owner of a home cannot refuse to enter into a rental agreement based on an applicant having terminated a rental agreement due to such domestic violence, rape, sexual assault or stalking. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 186 �25. A housing subsidy provider also cannot deny assistance on this basis. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 186 �25.
Upon request, a homeowner is required, in Massachusetts to allow the tenant (at the tenant�s expense) to change the locks of an individual dwelling unit where the tenant, co-tenant or household member lives if that person is under an imminent threat of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, or stalking at the premises. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 186 �26(b). A homeowner cannot refuse to enter into a rental agreement based on an applicant having requested a change of locks on this basis. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 186 �25. A housing subsidy provider also cannot deny assistance on this basis. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 186 �25. If a landlord prevents the tenant from changing the locks or otherwise fails to make a good faith effort to provide a new key to said tenant, co-tenant, or household member requesting the lock change, is liable for the greater of actual and consequential damages or three months� rent. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 186 �26(g).
In Massachusetts, any person suffering from harassment may file a complaint requesting protection from such harassment. Mass Gen. Laws Ch. 258E�� 3(a). A person can seek a harassment prevention order against any other person who has harassed, stalked, or sexually assaulted them, irrespective of the relationship between the two parties . The person seeking a harassment prevention order can request that the offender:
not abuse them by physical harm, attempt to physically harm, or place them in fear of imminent serious physical harm, and stop harassing (a) by any willful and malicious conduct aimed at them and intended to cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property; (b) by using force, threat, or duress to make them engage in sexual relations unwillingly; or (c) by committing against them any act that violates the Commonwealth�s laws on indecent assault and battery, rape, statutory rape, assault with intent to rape, enticing a child, criminal stalking, criminal harassment, or drugging for sexual intercourse;
pay monetary compensation for losses (e.g. loss of earnings, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained or property damaged, cost of replacement locks, medical expenses, cost for obtaining an unlisted phone number) suffered as a direct result of the harassment. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 258E, � 3(a).
Violating a harassment prevention order is a criminal offense punishable by 2.5 years imprisonment and a fine of as much as $5,000. In response to each violation of a harassment prevention order, courts in Massachusetts can order the offender to pay the person who requested the protection
monetary compensation (e.g. loss of earnings, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained or property damaged, cost of replace locks, medical expenses, cost for obtaining an unlisted phone number).
A restraining order can be granted for as long as one year as three years and can be extended for additional time as the court deems necessary to protect the plaintiff from harassment. Gen. Laws Ch. 258E, � 3(d).
In addition to the federal protections, the Rhode Island Fair Housing Practices Act (R.I. Gen. Laws � 34-37-4) also prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, source of income (e.g. a housing voucher, food stamps, Section 8, child support, alimony) military status as a veteran with an honorable discharge or general administrative discharge, status as a servicemember in the armed forces, country of ancestral origin, age, whether a member of the household is, has been, or is threatened with domestic abuse, and whether a tenant or housing applicant has obtained, sought, or is seeking relief from any court in the form of a restraining order for protection from domestic abuse.
The Residential Landlord and Tenant Act in Rhode Island (R.I. Gen. Laws � 34-18) provides, among other things, the following, which may be implicated in circumstances surrounding sexual harassment:
If a landlord deliberately uses a rental agreement containing provisions known to be unlawful, the tenant may recover, in addition to actual damages, an amount up to three months� rent and reasonable attorney�s fees. � 34-18-17(b).
If a provision in a rental agreement or settlement agreement is unconscionable (that is, of a degree so unreasonable or unfair) when made, the court may refuse to enforcement the agreement. � 34-18-13(a).
A rule or regulation, created by the landlord and concerning a tenant�s use and occupancy of the premises, is unenforceable if:
its purpose is not to (a) promote the convenience, safety, or welfare of tenants on the premises; (b) preserve the property from abusive use; or (c) make a fair distribution of services and facilities held out for tenants generally;
it is not sufficiently explicit in its prohibition, direction or limitation of tenant�s conduct to fairly inform the tenant of what the tenant must or must not do to comply;
A landlord cannot abuse the right of access or use that right to harass the tenant. Unless impracticable or in the instance of an emergency, the landlord must give two days� notice of intent to enter and may only enter at the dwelling at reasonable times. � 34-18-26(C).
If the landlord unlawful enters the dwelling, lawfully enters in an unreasonable manner, or makes repeated demands for otherwise lawful entry that has the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct or terminate the rental agreement. � 34-18-45(b).
Before increasing rent, a landlord for a residential tenancy, must provide notice of the increase in writing to a tenant at least 30 days before the rent is increased. � 34-18-16.1.
A landlord must comply with the requirements of applicable building and housing codes affecting health and safety; make repairs and do �whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition,� and keep all common areas of the premises in a clean and safe condition; and maintain in good and safe working order and a condition all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and other facilities and appliances, supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord. � 34-18-22(a). A tenant may recover actual damages and receive injunctive relief for a landlord�s failure to comply. � 34-18-28.
If a landlord unlawfully removes a tenant from the premises or willfully (i.e. intentionally, knowingly and purposely without justifiable excuse) diminishes services to a tenant by interrupting an essential service, the tenant may recover possession of the dwelling or terminate the rental agreement. The tenant may also recover possession, terminate the rental agreement, and recover the greater of three months of rent or threefold the actual damages sustained. � 34-18-34.
A landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent, decreasing services, or by threatening eviction because a tenant availed themselves of any lawful rights or remedies. � 34-18- 46(a)(4). If a landlord engages in this sort of retaliation the tenant is entitled to recover possession, terminate the rental agreement, and recover the greater of three months of rent or threefold the actual damages sustained. � 34-18-46(b).
In Rhode Island, a person may petition the court for an order (e.g. a restraining order) that will protect and support that person (and/or that person�s minor child) from sexual exploitation or domestic abuse. (R.I. Gen. Laws � 15-15-3) Rhode Island law defines domestic abuse, in pertinent part, as attempting to cause or causing physical harm; placing another person in fear of imminent serious physical harm; causing another to engage involuntarily in sexual relations by force, threat of force, or duress; stalking; or cyberstalking. � 15-15-1. A person can seek a restraining order against present or former family members, parents, stepparents, or, if a minor, a person with whom that minor has been in a substantive dating relationship.
that the offender be restrained from contacting, assaulting, molesting, sexually exploiting or interfering with the person at home or on the street;
The person suffering from domestic abuse has an opportunity to be present and testify when the court considers the petition.
� 15-15-3(i). If a court grants the order and the offender violates it, the� offender can be found in contempt of court, guilty of a misdemeanor, punished by a fine totaling as much as $1,000, and imprisoned for as long as one year for the initial violation. � 15-15-3(n)(1). Subsequent violations of offenses punishable as a misdemeanor involving domestic violence can, ultimately, be deemed a felony punishable for as many as 10 years in prison. � 15-15-3(n)(2); � 12-29-5.�A restraining order can be granted for as many as three years and can be extended for additional time if necessary to protect against abuse. � 15-15-3(m)(2).
All persons are prohibited from engaging in sexual harassment. In the context of housing, this might refer to landlords, property owners, developers, management companies, condo associations, property managers, housing authorities, real estate agents, builders, brokers, lenders, contractors, or other employees or agents of a housing provider as well as fellow tenants or other neighbors.
In addition, a housing provider is liable under the Fair Housing Act for the discriminatory conduct of the provider�s agents as well as that of third parties (e.g. other tenants) if the housing provider knew or should have known of the discriminatory conduct, has the power to correct it, and failed to do so. (link)� The housing provider can be held liable in this capacity even when the provider�s failure to act or correct the conduct is not motivated by an intent to discriminate. (link)
Contrary to popular myth, the sex, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation of the person responsible for the harassment does not exclude them from liability for the harassment.
A housing provider asks a person to perform sex or sexual favors in exchange for reduced rent, repairs, excused late payments, or excused fees;
An agent of the housing provider engages in unwelcomed sexual conduct, which may include making unwanted sexual advances, groping or touching;
A landlord makes severe or pervasive unwelcome, sexually suggestive comments in person, over the phone, or via text and enters a residence without permission;
A homeowner refuses to rent or sell a home to a person because of their gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation;
*This list does not include every example of sexual harassment. If you believe you have been sexually harassed by a landlord, housing provider, or any employee, agent, or contractor of the housing provider, please contact SouthCoast Fair Housing today to learn more about your options and how the law may protect you.
Testimony from the person who experienced or any person who witnessed the severe or pervasive unwelcome, sexually suggestive comments or conduct.
Emails, text messages, screenshots of Snapchats, or other forms of communication that show a landlord is requesting sexual favors in exchange for reduced rent or repairs.
Diary entries or notes made by the person who experienced the sexual harassment regarding: what happened; when and where it happened; any statements made; the names and position of the harasser; the names, addresses, and phone numbers of any witnesses or any other tenants who have also been harassed; and/or how the person experiencing the harassment felt when the event(s) transpired.
Any other documents related to the harassment, including: notes or gifts from the harasser, rent increase notices, warning notices, eviction notices, or police reports.
Recordings of conversations that have been lawfully obtained. In Rhode Island, you are not required to disclose that you are recording if you are a party to the conversation or at least one person is a party to the conversation consents to the recording after having full knowledge and notice that the conversation will be recorded.

The �Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) 42 U.S.C. ch. 136, Subchapter III VAWA is a federal law that protects against domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. In some instances, particularly when the housing provider receives federal funding, VAWA operates in concert with the Fair Housing Act to offer additional protections. (link) Despite the name of the law, VAWA does not just protect one group of people; it protects men, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and gender-non-conforming persons as well as women.
If you believe you have experienced sexual harassment or other forms of harassment based on your identity in a protected class, please contact SouthCoast Fair Housing for additional information and assistance.

Questions & Answers for Small Employers on Employer Liability for Harassment by Supervisors | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
This technical assistance document was issued upon approval of the Chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
This document provides information regarding Title VII legal standards for employer liability for harassment by supervisors, as well as practical guidance regarding the duty of employers to prevent and correct harassment and the duty of employees to avoid
Title VII, ADEA, ADA, Rehabilitation Act, 29 CFR Part 1601, 29 CFR Part 1604, 29 CFR Part 1605, 29 CFR Part 1606, 29 CFR Part 1625, 29 CFR Part 1630, 29 CFR Part 1635
The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (Title VII) prohibits harassment of an employee based on race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits harassment of employees who are 40 or older on the basis of age, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits harassment based on disability, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits harassment of an employee based on genetic information. All of the anti-discrimination statutes enforced by the EEOC prohibit retaliation for complaining of discrimination or participating in complaint proceedings.
The Supreme Court issued two major decisions in June of 1998 that explained when employers will be held legally responsible for unlawful harassment by supervisors. The EEOC's Guidance on Employer Liability for Harassment by Supervisors examines those decisions and provides practical guidance regarding the duty of employers to prevent and correct harassment and the duty of employees to avoid harassment by using their employers' complaint procedures.
Harassment violates federal law if it involves discriminatory treatment based on race, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct), religion, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or because the employee opposed job discrimination or participated in an investigation or complaint proceeding under the EEO statutes. Federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not extremely serious. The conduct must be sufficiently frequent or severe to create a hostile work environment or result in a "tangible employment action," such as hiring, firing, promotion, or demotion.
An employer is always responsible for harassment by a supervisor that culminated in a tangible employment action. If the harassment did not lead to a tangible employment action, the employer is liable unless it proves that: 1) it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment; and 2) the employee unreasonably failed to complain to management or to avoid harm otherwise
An individual qualifies as an employee's "supervisor" if the individual has the authority to recommend tangible employment decisions affecting the employee.
A "tangible employment action" means a significant change in employment status. Examples include hiring, firing, promotion, demotion, undesirable reassignment, a decision causing a significant change in benefits, compensation decisions, and work assignment.
This might occur if a supervisor fires or demotes a subordinate because she rejects his sexual demands, or promotes her because she submits to his sexual demands.
Employers should establish, distribute to all employees, and enforce a policy prohibiting harassment and setting out a procedure for making complaints. In most cases, the policy and procedure should be in writing.
Small businesses may be able to discharge their responsibility to prevent and correct harassment through less formal means. For example, if a business is sufficiently small that the owner maintains regular contact with all employees, the owner can tell the employees at staff meetings that harassment is prohibited, that employees should report such conduct promptly, and that a complaint can be brought "straight to the top." If the business conducts a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation of any complaint that arises and undertakes swift and appropriate corrective action, it will have fulfilled its responsibility to "effectively prevent and correct harassment."
An employer's anti-harassment policy should make clear that the employer will not tolerate harassment based on race, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information, or harassment based on opposition to discrimination or participation in complaint proceedings. The policy should also state that the employer will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who complains of harassment or who participates in an investigation.
The employer should encourage employees to report harassment to management before it becomes severe or pervasive.
The employer should designate more than one individual to take complaints, and should ensure that these individuals are in accessible locations. The employer also should instruct all of its supervisors to report complaints of harassment to appropriate officials.
The employer should assure employees that it will protect the confidentiality of harassment complaints to the extent possible.
10. Is a complaint procedure adequate if employees are instructed to report harassment to their immediate supervisors?
No, because the supervisor may be the one committing harassment or may not be impartial. It is advisable for an employer to designate at least one official outside an employee's chain of command to take complaints, to assure that the complaint will be handled impartially.
An employer should conduct a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation. The alleged harasser should not have any direct or indirect control over the investigation.
The investigator should interview the employee who complained of harassment, the alleged harasser, and others who could reasonably be expected to have relevant information. The Guidance provides examples of specific questions that may be appropriate to ask.
Before completing the investigation, the employer should take steps to make sure that harassment does not continue. If the parties have to be separated, then the separation should not burden the employee who has complained of harassment. An involuntary transfer of the complainant could constitute unlawful retaliation. Other examples of interim measures are making scheduling changes to avoid contact between the parties or placing the alleged harasser on non-disciplinary leave with pay pending the conclusion of the investigation.
If an employer determines that harassment occurred, it should take immediate measures to stop the harassment and ensure that it does not recur. Disciplinary measures should be proportional to the seriousness of the offense. The employer also should correct the effects of the harassment by, for example, restoring leave taken because of the harassment and expunging negative evaluations in the employee's personnel file that arose from the harassment.
An employer should correct harassment that is clearly unwelcome regardless of whether a complaint is filed. For example, if there is graffiti in the workplace containing racial or sexual epithets, management should not wait for a complaint before erasing it.
An employer should ensure that its supervisors and managers understand their responsibilities under the organization's anti-harassment policy and complaint procedures.
An employer should screen applicants for supervisory jobs to see if they have a history of engaging in harassment. If so, and the employer hires such a candidate, it must take steps to monitor actions taken by that individual in order to prevent harassment.
An employer should keep records of harassment complaints and check those records when a complaint of harassment is made to reveal any patterns of harassment by the same individuals.
Yes. The employee must take reasonable steps to avoid harm from the harassment. Usually, the employee will exercise this responsibility by using the employer's complaint procedure.
15. Is an employer legally responsible for its supervisor's harassment if the employee failed to use the employer's complaint procedure?
No, unless the harassment resulted in a tangible employment action or unless it was reasonable for the employee not to complain to management. An employee's failure to complain would be reasonable, for example, if he or she had a legitimate fear of retaliation. The employer must prove that the employee acted unreasonably.
16. If an employee complains to management about harassment, should he or she wait for management to complete the investigation before filing a charge with EEOC?
It may make sense to wait to see if management corrects the harassment before filing a charge. However, if management does not act promptly to investigate the complaint and undertake corrective action, then it may be appropriate to file a charge. The deadline for filing an EEOC charge is either 180 or 300 days after the last date of alleged harassment, depending on the state in which the allegation arises. This deadline is not extended because of an employer's internal investigation of the complaint.
Further guidance on harassment can be found in the 1999 Guidance on Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors; the 1980 Guidelines on Sexual Harassment; the 1990 Policy Statement on Current Issues in Sexual Harassment; the 1990 Policy Statement on Sexual Favoritism; and the 1994 Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.. These can all be found on EEOC's web site https://www.eeoc.gov.

The Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative is an effort by the U.S. Attorney�s Office and the Department of Justice�s (DOJ) Civil Rights Division to combat sexual harassment in housing by addressing sexual harassment by landlords, property managers, maintenance workers, loan officers or other people who have control over housing.
The U.S. Attorney�s Office can investigate reports of sexual harassment in housing and file lawsuits against harassers, even if the harassment occurred many years ago.
If you or someone you know has been sexually harassed by someone connected to housing, contact the U.S. Attorney�s Office�s Victim Witness Unit at 617-748-3274 or�by e-mailing�USAMA.victimassistance@usdoj.gov.
In October 2017, DOJ�s Civil Rights Division�announced�the�Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative. Two federal statutes � the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act � prohibit sexual harassment in housing and are used to investigate and bring lawsuits. The U.S. Attorney�s Office works with other government agencies, such as the�U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, state and local governments, and law enforcement, to help victims of sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment in housing includes demands for sex or sexual acts in order to buy, rent, or continue renting a home. It also includes other unwelcome sexual conduct that makes it hard to keep living in or feel comfortable in your home.
My landlord made a lot of comments about having sex with me. I ignored him. When I fell behind on rent, the landlord said there was another way I could pay. I said no and he evicted me.
The housing authority inspector wouldn�t approve the apartment I wanted to rent with my voucher unless I performed a sexual act. I agreed in order to get my family off the street.
The maintenance person won�t fix anything in my apartment unless I have sex with him. I don�t know what I�m going to do about the broken heater when it gets even colder.
The owner of the home I rent makes comments about my body, clothes, and the sexual acts he wants me to perform on him.
The Fair Housing Act and other federal laws prohibit sexual harassment.� These laws also prohibit harassment because of race, color, religion, national origin, familial status, or disability.
Sexual harassment in housing is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Fair Housing Act. Sex discrimination is also prohibited by other federal laws, such as Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972. There are two main types of sexual harassment: (1) quid pro quo sexual harassment; and (2) hostile environment sexual harassment.
Quid pro quo harassment occurs when a housing provider requires a person to submit to an unwelcome request to engage in sexual conduct as a condition of obtaining or maintaining housing or housing-related services. For example:
Hostile environment harassment occurs when a housing provider subjects a person to severe or pervasive unwelcome sexual conduct that interferes with the sale, rental, availability, or terms, conditions, or privileges of housing or housing-related services, including financing. For example:
A maintenance man sends a tenant severe or pervasive unwelcome, sexually suggestive texts and enters her apartment without invitation or permission.
If you are being sexually harassed, you can file a complaint with HUD. If you would be safe doing so, you can tell the harasser to stop. You can also make a complaint to your housing provider, if different from the harasser.
When you file your complaint with HUD, you should tell them the name of the person harassing you, when and where it happened, and the names of any witnesses or other individuals who have been or are being harassed.

Massachusetts does not have a legal definition for full-time or part-time employees. Please see your employee handbook for your employer�s definition of full-time vs. part-time status.
Employee. Someone who works in the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.
Full-Time Employee. One who is hired to work at least the normal number of hours in a workweek as defined by an employer or a statute, usu. 35 to 40 hours.
Part-Time Employee. One who is hired to work fewer hours (usu. substantially fewer) than the normal number in a workweek as defined by an employer or a statute.
Probationary Employee. A recently hired employee whose ability and performance are being evaluated during a trial period of employment.
Seasonal Employee. An employee who is engaged to work for only a certain time of the year when a business anticipates a cyclical increase in demand.
�There is no legal distinction between part-time employees and full-time employees. Customarily, terms and conditions of part-time and full-time employees are similar, although benefits that are based on scheduled or worked hours are usually prorated. Employers are free (absent collective bargaining constraints) to establish entirely different terms and conditions for part-time employees.�

Even where a defendant city "could have and should have done more" to protect a student from bullying, and their inaction resulted in the child being severely injured during a bullying incident, the Mass.

Doe by and through Doe v. Hopkinton Public Schools, 490 F.Supp.3d 448 (D. Mass. 2020) Neither school district's anti-bullying policy, nor the Massachusetts anti-bullying statute, which prohibited repeated speech or conduct directed at victim that caused physical or emotional harm or infringed upon victim's educational rights, were facially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment, absent showing that either the policy or the statute prohibited a substantial amount of protected speech or conduct.

Even where a defendant city "could have and should have done more" to protect a student from bullying, and their inaction resulted in the child being severely injured during a bullying incident, the Mass. Tort Claims Act bars a suit against the city and its employees where they did not "originally cause" the situation.
Doe by and through Doe v. Hopkinton Public Schools, 490 F.Supp.3d 448 (D. Mass. 2020) Neither school district's anti-bullying policy, nor the Massachusetts anti-bullying statute, which prohibited repeated speech or conduct directed at victim that caused physical or emotional harm or infringed upon victim's educational rights, were facially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment, absent showing that either the policy or the statute prohibited a substantial amount of protected speech or conduct.

Welcome to the Mass.gov website (�Mass.gov�). Your privacy is one of our top priorities. This policy applies only to the use of Mass.gov website.
Mass.gov or�www.mass.gov�is the official website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Organizations, Offices, and State entities that make up the government of Massachusetts post official content here and provide information to the public about their programs and services.
As you navigate the Mass.gov website, you will see links that, when clicked, will take you to other Commonwealth websites. These other websites may be operated by state agencies. Clicking these links may also take you �to other websites outside �of Massachusetts state government.
These other websites may have individual privacy policies specifically tailored to the interactions available through each site. Because this privacy policy only applies to Mass.gov, you should examine the privacy policy of any website, including other Commonwealth websites, that you access using Mass.gov.
Whenever you visit Mass.gov, be aware that some information is automatically collected. None of the information automatically collected is personally identifiable, which means this information would not identify you as an individual.
Some Mass.gov services, such as the creation of a user account or the submission of a form, will require you to provide additional, and potentially personally identifiable information.
Mass.gov is subject to the Massachusetts Public Records Law. If you submit any information to us, that information�may�become public record and subject to disclosure upon request.
Your privacy with respect to the use of Mass.gov results from a partnership between you the user, and the Commonwealth. At Mass.gov, we work to protect your privacy in accordance with best industry practices and the�EOTSS Enterprise Information Security Policies and Standards. However, because some of the information that we receive through Mass.gov is subject to the�Massachusetts Public Records Law (M.G.L. c. 66)�we cannot ensure absolute privacy. Information that you provide to us through Mass.gov may be made available to members of the public under that law. This policy informs you of the information that we collect from you at Mass.gov, what we do with it, to whom it may be disseminated, and how you can access it. Based on this information, you can make an informed decision about your use of Mass.gov. You can maximize the benefits of your privacy partnership with the Commonwealth by making informed decisions about whether to share personally identifiable information with us through Mass.gov.
We use the term �personally identifiable information� to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, birth date, bank account information, credit card information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you.
We do not sell any personally identifiable information collected through Mass.gov or submitted to the Commonwealth in conjunction with using functions on Mass.gov, and there is no direct or online public access to the information. However, once you voluntarily submit personally identifiable information to us related to your use of Mass.gov, its dissemination is governed by the Public Records Law, the�Fair Information Practices Act (M.G.L. c. 66A),�and other applicable laws and regulations.�For this reason, part or all of the information you send us may be provided to a member of the public in response to a public records request.�There are pieces of information, such as credit card numbers, TIN, username, or password that are not considered public for the purposes of a public records request. For more information on types of data exempted from disclosure under the Public Records Law, please refer to the Secretary of the Commonwealth�s�A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law.
Mass.gov collects voluntary information from you through surveys, online forms, any emails sent to Mass.gov, and any suggestions, requests, or comments posted on pages hosted by Mass.gov (such as blogs or wikis). All such information, including comments and emails sent by you to Mass.gov, may contain personally identifiable information.
While Mass.gov is intended as a medium for disseminating information from state agencies, if you need to contact a state agency that is part of Mass.gov, you should use the contact information for that state agency posted on its Mass.gov website.
Mass.gov collects and stores your Internet Protocol (�IP�) address, indefinitely, as well as information about the date and time of your visit, whether a file you have requested exists, and how many �bytes� of information Mass.gov transmitted to you over the web. We use your IP address to assess the frequency of visits to Mass.gov and the popularity of its various pages and functions. We will not attempt to match any personally identifiable information that you provide to us with your IP address, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that doing so would provide information that is relevant and material to a criminal investigation. The one exception is that when you fill out information in a form on Mass.gov, we receive your IP address along with this submission. We do not use this form-related IP address information unless it may be relevant and material to a criminal investigation.

Mass.gov uses cookies and tools for data collection and analytics to learn more about how visitors to Mass.gov find and interact with the pages they visit.� We may use this information to improve our service offerings and better tailor individual user experience. These tools may also collect data such as browser information, operating system, and page views through the implementation of �persistent cookies� or �session cookies.�
Mass.gov employs the use of "persistent cookies." The purpose of these persistent cookies is to collect and aggregate data regarding Mass.gov�s visitor activity in order for the Mass.gov Office to continuously evaluate and improve its website services, including on Mass.gov or affiliated websites (collectively, the �Offerings�). You may elect to disable the Persistent Cookies. Please be advised that disabling the Persistent Cookies may affect your ability to view or interact with Mass.gov.
Persistent cookies will allow the website to recognize you when you visit again and tailor the information presented to you based on your needs and interests.

If you would like more information about the persistent cookies currently in use on Mass.gov, you may fill out this form.
We also use "session cookies" to enhance or customize your visit to this website. Session cookies can be created automatically on the device you use to access this state agency website. These session cookies do not contain personal information and do not compromise your privacy or security. We may use the cookie feature to store a randomly generated identifying tag on the device you use to access this website. A session cookie is erased during operation of your browser or when your browser is closed.
The software and hardware you use to access Mass.gov allows you to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies. Refusing or deleting these cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some features of this website. Some of the tools permit you to opt-out of the tool by allowing that tool to plant a persistent cookie on your web browser indicating that you have opted out. If you disable cookies on your browser or use a different browser, different computer, different user account, etc., you will need to opt-out again.
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy (e.g., possibly in response to a public records request), we do not combine the information collected through the use of any tool with personally identifiable information.
Third-party cookies are cookies that are tracked by websites other than the one you are visiting. Mass.gov uses data analytics and interactive tools, such as chatbots, (each a �Tool� and collectively, the �Tools�) to improve Mass.gov and make the site more responsive to customer needs. These Tools may automatically and anonymously collect and record your interactions with our web sites. You can learn more about some of the tools Mass.gov may use by visiting our Third-Party Data Analytic Tools�page.
Third-party services, such as Formstack, may provide online forms on Mass.gov. When you use such a service, your form submission is either sent directly to a Mass.gov email account (e.g., public records request forms) or is securely made to the service provider (e.g., Formstack) and stored there. Form submissions sent to the service provider are then transmitted to state government staff. State government staff may then delete form submissions from the service provider�s environment when there is no longer any administrative need to retain them there. Information submitted to the form service providers will be used only for internal purposes and will not be distributed or sold to other third parties unless required by law or pursuant to a valid government request.
In addition, the information that you voluntarily submit will be disclosed only to Commonwealth employees or officials, or those under contract with the Commonwealth, with a �need to know� for purposes of fulfilling their job responsibilities. The information will be used for such purposes as: providing and improving service offerings, answering your questions, responding to any requests for assistance, generating summary statistics about usage, auditing applications and detecting fraud, aiding in the planning, design and development of Mass.gov, and fulfilling the Commonwealth's legal obligations.
We will collect and aggregate the information you provide through surveys and through Mass.gov�s collection of non-personally identifying analytics data to improve Mass.gov and make the site more responsive to customer needs. Where appropriate, we may provide the information you submitted voluntarily through a form or email to the person or company that is the subject of your inquiry, or to a government agency responsible for the matters referred to in your communication.
The Public Records Law and the Fair Information Practices Act provide you with certain rights to get information about you that is in our records. To learn more about the circumstances under which you can get and correct this information, please click on the above links to these laws.
Because information sent to the Commonwealth may not be encrypted, you should not send messages containing information that you consider highly sensitive to Mass.gov. We use standard security measures to ensure that information provided by you, including your personally identifiable information, is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We also use software to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we make no attempts to identify individual users or their usage habits.
We reserve the right to change the terms of this policy at any time. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed of any updates. The date that this policy was last modified can be found at the top of this page. Any modifications are effective immediately.
