It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person�s sex. Harassment can include sexual harassment�or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors�and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.
Harassment doesn't have to be of a sexual nature. It can include offensive remarks about a person�s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.
Although the law doesn�t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker�or someone who isn't an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.

CIVIC ENGAGEMENTCivic Engagement is composed of individual and collective actions to identify and address issues of public concern. Civic engagement can take many forms, from individual volunteerism to organizational involvement to electoral participation. It can include efforts to directly address an issue, work with others in a community to solve a problem or interact with the institutions of representative democracy. Civic engagement encompasses a range of specific activities such as working in a soup kitchen, serving on a neighborhood association, writing a letter to an elected official, or voting. Indeed, an underlying principle  is that an engaged citizen should have the ability, agency, and opportunity to move comfortably among these various types of civic acts.Source: Michael Delli Carpini, Director, Public Policy, The Pew Charitable Trusts (apa.org)
MENTORINGMentoring is a consistent and stable relationship between youth and a caring role model(s) that involves regular, ideally face-to-face contact and is focused on building the character, capabilities, and confidence of the mentee(s). Mentoring can be formal
in the form of one-to-one, group, peer, community, school, faith-based, or mentoring that happens informally daily. Mentoring is one way for individuals to give youth another person who cares about them, who assures them they are not alone in dealing
with day-to-day challenges, and someone who makes them feel like they matter.Source: MentorKansas
NATIONAL SERVICEAmerica was founded on a promise of opportunity. When we build stronger communities, we help make this promise a reality for everyone to succeed. Especially in times of adversity, we find the courage to unite and overcome. We are supporting our communities, helping them prosper, head-on and together. It is what AmeriCorps is built for: bringing all Americans together�working alongside each other to improve every community�ensuring that everyone gets the help they need and the opportunities they deserve. AmeriCorps is your chance to be a part of something bigger. Source: AmeriCorps.gov
VOLUNTEERISMPeople the world over engage in volunteerism for a great variety of reasons: to help to eliminate poverty and to improve essential health and education, to tackle environmental issues, to reduce the risk of disasters, or to combat social exclusion
and violent conflict. In all these fields, volunteerism makes a specific contribution by generating well-being for people and their communities.�Volunteers are motivated by values like justice, equality, and freedom. A society that supports and encourages different forms of volunteering is likely to be one that also promotes its citizens' well-being.Source: Unv.org/power-volunteerism
MLK DAY OF SERVICE MINI-GRANT OPPORTUNITY��Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said,�"Life's most persistent and urgent question is:�'What are you doing for others?'"�Each year, Americans across the country answer that question by coming together on the King Holiday to serve their neighbors and communities. The�MLK Day of Service�is a part of��AmeriCorps'�national call to service initiative. The MLK Day of Service empowers individuals, strengthens communities, bridges barriers creates solutions to social problems, and moves us closer to Dr. King's vision of a beloved community.�These mini-grants offer eligible entities grant funding to recruit and engage volunteers in meaningful service activities or deliver a service-learning activity related to Dr. King. A service-learning activity is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities. Preference will be given to applicants who engage one other community partner in the event's planning, collaboration, or execution. Service activities should engage a minimum of 10 volunteers, and paid staff may not count as volunteers.�Questions? Email:��volunteer@ksde.org�Click here to apply!

It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person�s sex. Harassment can include sexual harassment�or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors�and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.
Harassment doesn't have to be of a sexual nature. It can include offensive remarks about a person�s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.
Although the law doesn�t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker�or someone who isn't an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.

It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person's sex. Harassment can include "sexual harassment" or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.
Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person's sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.
Although the law doesn't prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.
