50 Weeks, 50 Stories - Starting June 23rd the KSHSAA will celebrate the 50th year of Title IX, when Congress proclaimed that "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

The stories to come will highlight the legends and trail blazers that we are so fortunate to have in Kansas. We are grateful to partner with WIN for KC, an organization with the mission to empower the lives of girls and women by advocating and promoting the lifetime value of sports through opportunities for participation and leadership development.

Predicting greatness for young athletes is always a precarious challenge. One never really knows what the talent of a young athlete will blossom into years later. When Lesha Wood ran middle school sprints for a physical fitness test and then broke a school record in the 880-yard run during a summer AAU meet, there was no expectation of the records that would not only follow her, but also her two younger sisters - Joy and Jill.
"Title IX affected sports so dramatically. But you can't have something that big that doesn't impact all areas within a school," said Martha Gabel, Fine Arts Coordinator of the Olathe Public School District and former president of the Kansas Music Educators Association. "I think the idea behind Title IX is opportunities. [Read]
I have loved sports and recreation activities as long as I can remember. In grade school I loved the teachers and subjects taught - but I really loved recess and the chance to be with friends experiencing the spirit of play and competition. I played kick ball, dodge ball, basketball, etc. - often the lone girl with the boys. At home I could be found outside playing football with the boys, shooting baskets on the driveway, riding my bike around the neighborhood, etc. [Read]
Brenda Holaday has had a bird's eye view of what Title IX legislation has meant to female athletes not only in Kansas, but across the United States. Holaday has been a highly-successful softball coach at the high school and NCAA Division II level for more than four decades as well as a high school and college athlete.
And while the current Washburn University and former Washburn Rural coach is immensely proud of how far women's sports has progressed over the past 50 years, she knows there's still progress that can be made in years to come. [Read]
When Gary Cornelsen returned to Liberal in the late 1980s after nearly a decade of coaching football and track in Texas, he found the Redskins' gridiron and track programs in need of an injection.
It did not take long for the Oklahoma native to rebuild the Liberal program in both sports.  During the 1990s and early 2000s, the southwest Kansas high school became a hotbed of success in the fall as well as the spring. [Read]
Silver Lake softball has enjoyed amazing success under a variety of coaching combinations for the past 30 years. Thirteen state softball championships and four runner-up trophies later, Silver Lake ranks second behind Bishop Carroll's 14 state titles for the softball capital of Kansas.
Softball enjoys the highest winning percentage of any Silver Lake sport. Silver Lake graduate Lexi Cobb currently plays softball at North Texas University and power-hitting Daryn Lamprech stars at Northern Iowa. The Eagles' softball tradition started in 1989 under legendary Silver Lake football coach C.J. Hamilton. [Read]
Running wasn't always easy for Alysun Deckert. She only made it look that way. A standout runner from Salina South, Deckert dominated Class 5A girls distance events in Kansas over a three-year span from 1981 through 1984. So much so that nearly 40 years later, current athletes are still chasing some of her school and state meet records.
Deckert won nine state titles over her final three years at South, including three individual state cross country titles. She also swept the 1,600 and 3,200-meter runs at the 5A state track meet each of her final three seasons. While doing so, she overcame bouts with injuries and anemia - setbacks that only seemed to make her stronger. [Read]
Catherine Fox won national titles in five individual events and several relays as a member of the Stanford University women's swim team in the 1990s. And she was an All-American in every single event in which she competed. That's seven All-America honors each season – 28 total in her four-year career as a Cardinal swimmer.
Since her record-setting Shawnee Heights track and cross country career ended in 2004, Kansas State High School Activities Association Hall of Famer Trisa Nickoley never completely got away from sports.
Nickoley went on to a standout career at Missouri and her profession is helping to promote corporate wellness, but lately the 17-time Kansas state champion has started feeling like it may be time to get more involved with the sport she loves.
Nickoley, who has a 17-month-old son, Armani, recently moved back to her old Topeka stomping grounds and has relatives who are getting involved in sports, which has served to rekindle Nickoley's memories of her career. [Read]
Once she discovered her passion for swimming as a 10-year-old, the Manhattan native dove in with abandon, putting in two workouts a day, six days a week. That had work paid off with eight Kansas high school gold medals, six state records, and recognition as an All-American. It continued to pay off with a scholarship to Stanford. And it led her to medical school and a career as a radiologist.
"Swimming takes a lot of time, and there are a lot of sacrifices you have to make along the way," Oberhelman said. "I think that developed my work ethic and my ability to dedicate myself to something. It helped my focus.[Read]
The late Janell (Smith) Carson of Fredonia, who passed away in 2020 after a battle with cancer, was one of the greatest girls track and field athletes in Kansas history despite never getting the opportunity to run a single high school race.
But Carson, who passed away at the age of 73, was one of many outstanding female athletes in the pre-Title IX era who accentuated the need for the legislation that has changed the lives of countless athletes over the last 50 years. [Read]
Myers, a graduate of Little River High School, rightfully earned her reputation as one of the greatest female track and field stars in Kansas high school history. She won 13 individual gold medals at the State Outdoor championships, one relay gold and sparked Little River to three team titles. Myers was a four-time state champion in the 100 and 200 meters, a three-time long jump champion and two-time 400-meter champ. [Read]
The trophy has seen better days, the head of the player mounted on the base broken off long ago. But it remains one of Lynette Woodard's most prized possessions. For it was the beginning."I cherish the little trophy I got at home with the head broke off now," Woodard said of the hardware earned during the earliest stages of playing basketball. "That was the seed that kept me going."
From that seed sprouted one of the most prolific and legendary basketball careers anyone has ever enjoyed, male or female. Woodard went on to star at every level - in high school at Wichita North, collegiately at the University of Kansas, professionally in the WNBA and globally with the United States Olympic team (twice) and the Harlem Globetrotters.

It seems like everyone has a story about Claflin's Jackie Stiles, and it's to the point that they've become folklore. Maybe you've heard about how she decided as a second grader that she'd not only play in the pros but be Rookie of the Year? Or how she resolved, after one poor performance, to make 1,000 shots a day?
Or how about when she broke her right wrist - on her shooting hand - as a sophomore and then averaged 20 points a game while playing left-handed? Maybe you were even in one of those post-game autograph lines that stretched endlessly because you had to meet Stiles? [Read]
Emily Ryan's high-school basketball career at Central Plains High School is legendary. Ryan owns girls state basketball records for career steals (599), career free throw percentage (90.5 percent), career field goal percentage (.738); season field goal percentage (.796) and best single game free throw percentage (14-14, 100 percent).

Title IX of the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights enforces and protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs for schools of all levels. In 2022, women's athletics celebrate a half-century of equal rights to participate in sports. The Kansas State High School Activities Association embarked on a year-long celebration of people in Kansas who have influenced the growth of sports for female student-athletes.
The inaugural Kansas Girls State Wrestling Tournament meant different things for different people.For some, the event in February 2020 was the culmination of years of hard work. For others, it provided an opportunity to show what was possible for a group of determined female athletes when given the chance.
More than 40 years later, McPherson's Doug and Mya Kretzer realized there were still opportunities unfulfilled. Together they helped lead an effort to give high school girls in Kansas a chance to make wrestling a sport of their own.  [Read]
Brenda (Bruggeman) Cox couldn't even imagine what a college basketball career would look like when she started playing competitively in the seventh grade. So having four daughters, who would excel in college sports, win national championships and go on to play professionally was the farthest thing from her mind.
By the time Emily Ryan played her first basketball game as a Central Plains freshman during the 2016-17 season, she had already seen so much winning by the Oilers. Her older sister, Janae, had been part of three state titles, along with their dad, Jim, an assistant coach.
"When I was in fifth, sixth grade when my sister was on the team, I thought they were the greatest," said Emily Ryan, who now plays at Iowa State. "They started the streak and had an incredible team…. I walked into a situation that was so good. The culture, it's something I'll never forget."  [Read]
Ask Shalee Lehning about playing driveway basketball with her older brother, Matt, and his friends when she was a precocious young girl and she will tell you that it all seemed natural. Ask the former Sublette High School all-around standout athlete about playing pick-up games with the guys when she was in middle and high school, and she will tell you that it all was just the way of life in a small southwest Kansas community. When Lehning started playing organized sports and the girls and boys were separated into their own competitions, that too seemed natural. She said she just never really thought about what those opportunities were and how they came to be at such a young age.  [Read]
Administrators at Bishop Miege High School in the Kansas City suburb of Roeland Park didn't have far to look when they started a girls' basketball program in the mid-1970s. They asked the local guy who was helping his daughter coach the St. Agnes Catholic School seventh- and eighth-grade teams across the street from Bishop Miege. That gym rat, Terry English, grew up just a few blocks from St. Agnes. He had starred in basketball at Bishop Miege in the 1960s and went on to play at Rockhurst College – also just a few miles from home. Of course, English said "yes" to the offer from Miege and also accepted a job as the school's physical education teacher.  [Read]

She played for the Washington Mystics and the Atlanta Dream in the WNBA and played in Poland, Turkey and Australia.  [Read]
She is the greatest high school gymnast in Kansas history, and very few people in her life know it. The 2013 graduate of Olathe East so dominated the state during her career, she earned 12 of 15 possible first-place medals at the state competition. But Meads made decisions along the way to be a well-rounded individual. She put gymnastics behind her after high school, focusing on other interests. Now a Spanish teacher at Combs High School (located southeast of Phoenix), Meads coaches high school pole vaulters on the side. She is married and dedicated to being a great teacher.  [Read]

Building a high school sports dynasty in Kansas doesn't come without hard work and sacrifice by coaches and players alike. Building a dynasty from the ground up, as Joan Wells did at Lawrence High School, can be even more of a daunting task.
Wells spent 27 years as the volleyball coach at Lawrence High and during that Hall of Fame career, led the Lions to the state volleyball tournament every year but one — 1971, her first year at Lawrence and the first year for state volleyball tournaments sponsored by the Kansas High School Activities Association.

Like virtually everyone involved with female athletics, hall of fame coaches Kimbrook and Kim Tennal, the winningest husband and wife coaching duo in Kansas history, are thankful for Title IX, which opened doors for females across the United States 50 years ago. The Tennals, who grew up in the 1960s and '70s, only regret that it didn't happen sooner. "It's come a long, long ways, it was just slow,'' said Kimbrook Tennal, best known for dominating coaching runs at Nemaha Valley (now Nemaha Central) and Centralia. "I always felt like it was such a rip-off that the girls in my class and the ones before that didn't get to do any sports at all.  [Read]
Anyone who knew Jill (Simpson) Miller as a youngster expected big things of her on the golf course when she reached high school. After all, she came from a golfing family. She said she practically lived at the small country club while growing up in Columbus, a town of about 3,000 in southeast Kansas. And after receiving her first set of clubs at age 10, she began competing - and excelling - in tournaments all across the state and beyond.  [Read]

If high school sports were effectively a boys club prior to 1972, they would be no longer, thanks to the enactment of Title IX. That meant opportunities for girls in all activities, and it also mean opportunities for women in the administration of those activities.
