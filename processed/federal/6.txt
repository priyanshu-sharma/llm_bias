The 14th Amendment provides, in part, that no state can "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Title IX specifically prohibits sex discrimination.
Ratified in 1868, Congress and the courts have applied the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause to many aspects of public life over the past 150 years. Title IX is an example of how the 14th Amendment has been interpreted over time. Title IX, which is of particular interest to young people, prohibits institutions that receive federal funding from excluding students from participating in educational and athletic programs on the basis of sex.
Specifically, Title IX states that “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
Title IX of the Civil Rights Act was signed into law on June 23, 1972 by President Richard M. Nixon. However, Title IX began its journey through all three branches of government when Representative Patsy T. Mink, of Hawaii, who is recognized as the major author and sponsor of the legislation, introduced it in Congress. When she died in 2002, Title IX was renamed the Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act. She was given the Medal of Freedom after her death.
One way to track the evolution of Title IX is to examine the Supreme Court’s 1984 decision in Grove City College v. Bell. As the high court’s first Title IX case, the issues that arose from the Act, demonstrate how each of the three branches exercises its authority. The case makes Title IX a study not only of the 14th Amendment but also of the impact of the push and pull of the separation of powers on law-abiding citizens.
The Legislative Branch. Congress enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which requires that no person be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination on the basis of sex under “any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” It authorizes any federal agency that provides such assistance to issue regulations to enforce the prohibition of sex discrimination. It also allows termination of financial assistance when an institution does not voluntarily comply.
The Executive Branch. In 1975, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (which became the Department of Education and is referred to here as the Department) issued implementing regulations requiring every educational institution that receives federal financial assistance to file a document assuring its compliance with Title IX.
The Judicial Branch. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 1984 that Title IX’s non-discrimination and compliance requirements apply to any educational institution that receives federal financial assistance through grants provided directly to its students. At that time, the requirement applied only to the specific program or activity receiving federal assistance.  In this instance the program was student financial aid.
The Legislative Branch. In early 1988, the Senate and House of Representatives each responded to the Supreme Court decision by passing legislation (Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987) which clarifies that a “program or activity,” for purposes of Title IX and other civil rights laws, refers to “all operations” of an institution whenever federal financial assistance is extended to “any part” of the institution.
The Executive Branch. On March 16, 1988, President Reagan vetoed the legislation on grounds that it “vastly and unjustifiably expand[s] the power of the [f]ederal government over the decisions and affairs of private organizations.”
The Legislative Branch. On March 22, 1988, Congress overrode the President’s veto by passing again the legislation with the support of a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate. As a result, the Civil Rights Restoration Act became law.
To get started, review the glossary and prepare students to use it with the case materials to underline terms and concept they find in the readings.
Have students read the Grove City College v. Bell facts and case summary and make a list of their questions and arguments.
Have students use the Title IX timeline as a reference for drawing a Venn Diagram or double bubble map to list the impacts of each branch of government on the evolution of Title IX.
Use the separation of powers discussion questions to illuminate how the push and pull of the three branches of government shaped Title IX. Guide students’ understanding of how the separation of powers has an impact on the their daily life and the issues that matter to them.
Have students view the Ahead of the Majority video on Representative Patsy Mink, often called the Mother of Title IX. Next, have students select a Pathways to the Bench video profile of a federal judge whose story also deals with personal adversities that motivated them to be of service.

1. A nongovernmental source1, other than a state or local bar association, a subject-matter bar association, a judicial association, the Judicial Division of the American Bar Association, or the National Judicial College, that wishes to pay for or reimburse federal judges’2 expenses (i.e., travel, food, lodging, or anything that would be considered a gift under the Judicial Conference Ethics Reform Act Gift Regulations)3 above the threshold at which judges must report reimbursements on their annual financial disclosure reports4 in connection with attending, as a speaker or participant, a program, a significant purpose of which is the education of United States federal or state judges, shall disclose to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts in writing the following information:
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts shall develop a detailed form for this purpose. Upon receipt, the Administrative Office shall promptly post the information on the Judiciary’s website (https://www.uscourts.gov) so that it is publicly available and available to judges. The filing shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of filing.
2. A federal judge shall not accept travel, food, lodging, reimbursement, or anything that would be considered a gift under the Judicial Conference Ethics Reform Act Gift Regulations from a nongovernmental source other than a state or local bar association, a subject-matter bar association, a judicial association, the Judicial Division of the American Bar Association, or the National Judicial College, in connection with attending, as a speaker or participant, a program, a significant purpose of which is the education of United States federal or state judges, unless the judge:
within 30 days following the conclusion of the educational program, files a report in the office of the relevant clerk of court (court of appeals, district court, Court of International Trade, Court of Federal Claims, or bankruptcy court, as appropriate), disclosing the dates of attendance, the name of the program provider(s), and the title of the educational program. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts shall develop a form for this purpose. This filing shall be available on the local court’s website. The filing shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of filing.
3. This is a policy of the Judicial Conference. It is not intended to change the Code of Conduct for United States Judges (see in particular Advisory Opinion No. 67 of the Judicial Conference Committee on Codes of Conduct) or the annual financial disclosure reporting requirements for judges under the Ethics in Government Act, 5 U.S.C. app. §§ 101-111.
1. If the support, financial or otherwise, comes from the general revenues of the program provider(s), and/or from endowments or gifts not raised for the particular educational program or for the purpose of educating judges, then it is sufficient to identify the program provider(s) as the source of support.
2. If the support, financial or otherwise, comes in whole or in part from money, goods or services from others (e.g., corporations, nonprofit organizations, foundations, individual donors) specifically for the particular educational program, or for the education of judges generally, list every such donor. This policy is not intended to require the disclosure and reporting of monies derived from tuition, educational program registration fees, and other similar enrollment fees.
4Currently, a judge must report any reimbursement exceeding $415. This figure is subject 4 to change every three years in accordance with the cost of living as determined by the Administrator of General Services. See 5 U.S.C. § 7342(a)(5); 41 C.F.R. sec. 102-42; see also 5 U.S.C. app. § 102(a)(2)(B).

Reports on criminal cases in which a right established in the Crime Victims’ Rights Act was asserted and relief was denied, describing the relief requested and the reason for the denial. Also discusses court rulings on petitions for writs of mandamus brought under this act. Covers decisions made during 12-month periods ending September 30.
This is the report to Congress on crime victims’ rights under §104(a) of the Justice for All Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-405. Section 104(a) requires the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO) to report “the number of times that a right established in Chapter 237 of title 18, United States Code, is asserted in a criminal case and the relief requested is denied and, with respect to each such denial, the reason for such denial, as well as the number of times a mandamus action is brought pursuant to Chapter 237 of title 18, and the result reached.” Title I of the Justice for All Act of 2004 is commonly referred to as the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) and is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771.

The rulemaking process is governed primarily by the Rules Enabling Act and the Procedures for the Judicial Conference's Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and Its Advisory Rules Committees.
The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2071-2077, authorizes the Supreme Court to prescribe general rules of practice and procedure and rules of evidence for the federal courts. The Act has been described as a treaty between Congress and the judiciary and represents a manifestation of the traditional doctrine of separation of powers. Congress, through the Act, delegated the essential rulemaking function to a co-equal branch of government while retaining the ability to review and reject any rule adopted by the Supreme Court.
Pursuant to Section 2073 of the Rules Enabling Act, the Judicial Conference has established procedures to govern the work of the Standing Committee and its advisory rules committees. These procedures do not limit the rules committees' authority, and failure to comply with them does not invalidate any rules committee action.

This policy sets forth the responsibilities for reporting and responding to allegations of fraud, waste, or abuse of resources for judiciary organizations.
Oversight mechanisms work together to hold judges and Judiciary staff responsible for their conduct as government officials and for the management of public resources.

The Judicial Conference of the U.S. approved the latest version of the policy in March 2008 to streamline the policy and eliminate provisions that are duplicative of the Rules of Practice and Procedure.
Amendments to the Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil, and Criminal Rules to implement the requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002 took effect on December 1, 2007. The new rules codify, to a large extent, the 2001 Judicial Conference privacy policy, as revised in 2003, requiring redaction of personal identifier information from filings1. The personal identifiers to be redacted are Social Security numbers, names of minor children, financial account numbers, dates of birth, and, in criminal cases, home addresses2.
Because of the enactment of the rules, the previous policy is no longer operative except for two portions of the earlier privacy policy that remain in force, separate from the new rules. They are listed below.
The following documents in a criminal case shall not be included in the public case file and should not be made available to the public at the courthouse or via remote electronic access:
sealed documents (e.g., motions for downward departure for substantial assistance, plea agreements indicating cooperation or victim statements).
Courts making electronic documents remotely available to the public shall make electronic transcripts of proceedings remotely available to the public if such transcripts are prepared. Prior to being made electronically available from a remote location, however, the transcripts must conform to Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a), Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.1(a), or Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9037(a).
Once a prepared transcript is delivered to the clerk’s office pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 753, the attorneys in the case are (or, where there is a self-represented party, the party is) responsible for reviewing it for the personal data identifiers required by the federal rules to be redacted, and providing the court reporter or transcriber with a statement of the redactions to be made to comply with the rules. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the attorney must review the following portions of the transcript:
Within seven calendar days of the delivery by the court reporter or transcriber of the official transcript to the clerk’s office, each attorney must inform the court, by filing a notice of redaction with the clerk, of his or her intent to direct the redaction of personal data identifiers from the electronic transcript of the court proceeding. If no such notice is filed within the allotted time, the court will assume redaction of personal data identifiers from the transcript is not necessary.
An attorney serving as “standby” counsel appointed to be available to assist a pro se defendant in his or her defense in a criminal case must review the same portions of the transcript as if the pro se defendant were his or her client. If the transcript relates to a panel attorney representation pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act (CJA), including serving as standby counsel, the attorney conducting the review is entitled to compensation under the CJA for functions reasonably performed to fulfill the redaction obligation and for reimbursement for related reasonable expenses.
A party is to submit to the court reporter or transcriber, within 21 calendar days of the transcript’s delivery to the clerk, or longer if a court so orders, a statement indicating where the personal data identifiers to be redacted appear in the transcript. The court reporter or transcriber must redact the identifiers as directed by the party.
These procedures are limited to the redaction of the specific personal data identifiers listed in the rules. During the 21-day period, or longer if the court so orders, an attorney may move the court for additional redactions to the transcript. The transcript shall not be made available on the internet until the court has ruled upon any such motion.
The court reporter or transcriber must, within 31 calendar days of the delivery of the transcript to the clerk of court, or longer if the court so orders, perform the requested redactions, and file a redacted version of the transcript with the clerk of court. The original unredacted electronic transcript should be retained by the clerk of court.
This policy applies to transcripts made available via CM/ECF, WEBPACER, PACER, RACER or a non-court related electronic depository (e.g., Exemplaris). It does not affect in any way the obligation of the court reporter or transcriber, pursuant to Judicial Conference policy, to promptly deliver to the clerk of court the court reporter’s or transcriber’s original records of a proceeding or the inclusion of a transcript with the records of the court.
Nothing in this policy changes any rules or policies with respect to sealing or redaction of court records for any other purpose.
This policy does not affect or limit the right of any party (or any other person or entity) to order production of a transcript on an expedited basis. This policy does not affect any court rules or ruling requiring the sealing of materials or the protection of sealed materials.
An attorney appointed pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) is entitled to compensation under the CJA for functions performed to fulfill his or her obligations under the policy, including the following: (1) traveling to gain access to the transcript, if needed; (2) reviewing a transcript to determine whether to file notice of intent to redact; (3) filing a notice of intent to redact or a motion for an extension of time; (4) reviewing a transcript to determine the location of information to be requested to be redacted or whether to file a motion for additional redaction; (5) preparing and filing a redaction request or motion; and (6) other actions (including creating pleadings, attending hearings or other follow-up). The attorney is also entitled to reimbursement under the CJA for the costs of obtaining a transcript for purposes of review. If a case involving a CJA representation has already been closed and the original attorney is no longer available, or if standby counsel is no longer available, new counsel may be appointed under the CJA and compensated as outlined above. In the event that the original appointed counsel is still available, but has filed a final voucher for the underlying case, the attorney shall be permitted to file a supplemental voucher for compensation.
Extensions of time to comply with the deadlines set forth in these procedures should not be routinely granted, due to the potential for delay of court of appeals proceedings in the event redaction procedures extend beyond 31 days.

The 14th Amendment provides, in part, that no state can "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Title IX specifically prohibits sex discrimination.
Ratified in 1868, Congress and the courts have applied the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause to many aspects of public life over the past 150 years. Title IX is an example of how the 14th Amendment has been interpreted over time. Title IX, which is of particular interest to young people, prohibits institutions that receive federal funding from excluding students from participating in educational and athletic programs on the basis of sex.
Specifically, Title IX states that “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
Title IX of the Civil Rights Act was signed into law on June 23, 1972 by President Richard M. Nixon. However, Title IX began its journey through all three branches of government when Representative Patsy T. Mink, of Hawaii, who is recognized as the major author and sponsor of the legislation, introduced it in Congress. When she died in 2002, Title IX was renamed the Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act. She was given the Medal of Freedom after her death.
One way to track the evolution of Title IX is to examine the Supreme Court’s 1984 decision in Grove City College v. Bell. As the high court’s first Title IX case, the issues that arose from the Act, demonstrate how each of the three branches exercises its authority. The case makes Title IX a study not only of the 14th Amendment but also of the impact of the push and pull of the separation of powers on law-abiding citizens.
The Legislative Branch. Congress enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which requires that no person be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination on the basis of sex under “any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” It authorizes any federal agency that provides such assistance to issue regulations to enforce the prohibition of sex discrimination. It also allows termination of financial assistance when an institution does not voluntarily comply.
The Executive Branch. In 1975, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (which became the Department of Education and is referred to here as the Department) issued implementing regulations requiring every educational institution that receives federal financial assistance to file a document assuring its compliance with Title IX.
The Judicial Branch. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 1984 that Title IX’s non-discrimination and compliance requirements apply to any educational institution that receives federal financial assistance through grants provided directly to its students. At that time, the requirement applied only to the specific program or activity receiving federal assistance.  In this instance the program was student financial aid.
The Legislative Branch. In early 1988, the Senate and House of Representatives each responded to the Supreme Court decision by passing legislation (Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987) which clarifies that a “program or activity,” for purposes of Title IX and other civil rights laws, refers to “all operations” of an institution whenever federal financial assistance is extended to “any part” of the institution.
The Executive Branch. On March 16, 1988, President Reagan vetoed the legislation on grounds that it “vastly and unjustifiably expand[s] the power of the [f]ederal government over the decisions and affairs of private organizations.”
The Legislative Branch. On March 22, 1988, Congress overrode the President’s veto by passing again the legislation with the support of a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate. As a result, the Civil Rights Restoration Act became law.
To get started, review the glossary and prepare students to use it with the case materials to underline terms and concept they find in the readings.
Have students read the Grove City College v. Bell facts and case summary and make a list of their questions and arguments.
Have students use the Title IX timeline as a reference for drawing a Venn Diagram or double bubble map to list the impacts of each branch of government on the evolution of Title IX.
Use the separation of powers discussion questions to illuminate how the push and pull of the three branches of government shaped Title IX. Guide students’ understanding of how the separation of powers has an impact on the their daily life and the issues that matter to them.
Have students view the Ahead of the Majority video on Representative Patsy Mink, often called the Mother of Title IX. Next, have students select a Pathways to the Bench video profile of a federal judge whose story also deals with personal adversities that motivated them to be of service.
