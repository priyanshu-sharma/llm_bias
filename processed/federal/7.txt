The regulation extends to all aspects of a school�s education program or activity and applies to any building owned or controlled by a student organization recognized by a college or university.
If a survivor chooses to participate in a grievance process, the regulation protects survivors from inappropriately being asked about prior sexual history (also known as �rape shield� protections), and the survivor must not be required to divulge any medical, psychological, or similarly privileged records.
A survivor never has to come face-to-face with the accused during a hearing, and an accused is never allowed to personally ask questions of a survivor.

The regulation provides students with a right to written notice of allegations, the right to an advocate, and the right to submit, examine, and challenge evidence.
All students have the right to an impartial finding based on evidence using a standard of evidence � either the preponderance of evidence standard or the clear and convincing standard � that applies to all members of the school community, including faculty.
