The U.S. Department of  Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces, among other statutes,  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX protects people from  discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive  federal financial assistance. Title IX states:
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education  program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
Title IX applies to  schools, local and state educational agencies, and other institutions that  receive federal financial assistance from the Department. These recipients include  approximately 17,600 local school districts, over 5,000 postsecondary  institutions, and charter schools, for-profit schools, libraries, and museums.  Also included are vocational rehabilitation agencies and education agencies of  50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories of the United States.
A recipient institution that receives Department funds must operate its education program or activity in a nondiscriminatory manner free of discrimination based on sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Some key issue areas in which recipients have Title IX obligations are: recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; treatment of LGBTQI+ students; discipline; single-sex education; and employment. Also, no recipient or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or its implementing regulations, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in a proceeding under Title IX. For a recipient to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. The Department’s Title IX regulations (Volume 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 106) provide additional information about the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.
OCR vigorously  enforces Title IX to ensure that institutions that receive federal financial  assistance from the Department comply with the law. OCR evaluates,  investigates, and resolves complaints alleging sex discrimination. OCR also  conducts proactive investigations, through directed investigations or compliance  reviews, to examine potential systemic violations based on sources of  information other than complaints.
In addition to its  enforcement activities, OCR provides information and guidance to schools, universities and other educational  institutions and agencies to assist them in voluntarily complying with the law.

The mission of the Office for Civil Rights is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation through vigorous enforcement of civil rights.
We serve student populations facing discrimination and the advocates and institutions promoting systemic solutions to civil rights problems.  An important responsibility is resolving complaints of discrimination. Agency-initiated cases, typically called compliance reviews, permit OCR to target resources on compliance problems that appear particularly acute. OCR also provides technical assistance to help institutions achieve voluntary compliance with the civil rights laws that OCR enforces.  An important part of OCR's technical assistance are partnerships designed to develop creative approaches to preventing and addressing discrimination.
The Office for Civil Rights enforces several Federal civil rights laws that
prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal financial
assistance from the Department of Education. Discrimination on the basis of
race, color, and national origin is prohibited by Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; sex discrimination is prohibited by
of 1972; discrimination on the basis of disability is prohibited by Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and age discrimination is prohibited
Act of 1975. These civil rights laws enforced by OCR extend to all state
education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities,
vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies,
libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. Areas
covered may include, but are not limited to: admissions, recruitment, financial
aid, academic programs, student treatment and services, counseling and guidance,
discipline, classroom assignment, grading, vocational education, recreation,
physical education, athletics, housing, and employment. OCR also has responsibilities
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by
public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). To view OCR’s guidance please visit the Policy Guidance Portal.
In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy
Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001).
Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary school
or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more
outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities
before or after school hours shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to
meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy
Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United
A complaint of discrimination can be filed by anyone who believes that an education institution that receives Federal financial assistance has discriminated against someone on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. The person or organization filing the complaint need not be a victim of the alleged discrimination, but may complain on behalf of another person or group.
The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a mandatory biennial collection of district-and school-level data. The CRDC is administered by OCR, which uses the data to enforce civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national, origin, sex, and disability. The data are collected from public-school districts and public schools in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The CRDC collects data on civil rights indicators at the early childhood through grade 12 levels. It measures factors that impact education equity and opportunity for students, including student access to courses, programs, resources, instructional and other staff – and school climate factors, such as student discipline and harassment. The CRDC data can be accessed at https://ocrdata.ed.gov. To submit a CRDC data quality concern with OCR, please contact us by emailing ocrdata@ed.gov. Please include “CRDC Data Quality Concern” in the subject heading.
Most of OCR's activities are conducted by its 12 enforcement offices throughout the country. These enforcement offices are organized into 4 divisions carrying out OCR's core work -- preventing, identifying, ending, and remedying discrimination against America's students. Three Enforcement Directors in the office of the Assistant Secretary oversee the work of, respectively, the Eastern and Southern and the Midwestern and Western divisions. OCR administrative offices in Washington, D.C., provide additional administrative support, coordination, policy development and overall leadership.

Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The collection was formerly administered as the Elementary and Secondary School Survey.
The CRDC gathers a variety of information including student enrollment and student’s access to educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learner, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights laws for which it is responsible. Information collected by the CRDC is also used by other ED offices as well as policymakers and researchers outside of ED.
For further general information about the CRDC, visit the CRDC FAQ page.
On April 18, 2023, OCR received approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to require all local educational agencies (LEA) in the country that receive federal financial assistance from ED, including every public school district, charter schools, juvenile justice facilities, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with disabilities, to respond to the CRDC for the 2021-22 and 2023-24 school years. OCR made changes to the CRDC, including, but not limited to the restoration of long-standing and useful data elements that have been collected in previous CRDCs as well as some new data elements. For more details about changes in the  2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs, please see 2021-22 Questions and Answers  PDF (183K) and 2023-24 Questions and Answers  PDF (181K). OCR will notify LEAs of the dates when they must submit data for the 2021-22 CRDC.

We also use persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take either the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index) or iPerceptions survey. Based on your usage pattern, you may be asked if you would like to complete a customer survey of our website. The persistent cookie is set to block repeated survey invitations, and it expires in 90 days. Simply put, if you say you don't want to participate in the survey, the cookie will remember this, and will not allow you to be asked again. We feel it is important and respectful to our users not to ask them the same question more than once. The ACSI or iPerceptions survey are customer satisfaction survey tools used by multiple federal agencies and organizations in the private sector. We use these surveys so we can compare ED.gov results to other government agencies and top commercial websites. These surveys enables ED.gov to: measure program performance; identify targets of opportunity; efficiently leverage scarce resources; obtain valuable feedback from our users; focus management's attention on outcomes; and report customer satisfaction results.
The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2-Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII)." The Guidance states, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected."

In those cases, all submitted information is used only for the expressed purposes for which it is intended and is not made available to any third party.
