UCR's Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action, as part of its mission to promote equity and create a working, living and learning climate free from discrimination and harassment, enforces UC anti-discrimination policies.  The two most important policies are the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, which we call the SVSH Policy, and UCR's Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Policy.  This website focuses on the SVSH Policy.  For information on the Discrimination Policy, which covers sex-based discrimination (and other types of discrimination and harassment, such as racial), please visit our main office website.
The SVSH Policy prohibits harassment based on sex.  It also prohibits retaliation for people who make a report of sexual harassment or engage in other protected activities.
Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct that is sexual in nature or otherwise based on sex and that is severe, persistent or pervasive and creates an intimidating or offensive environment.
Sometimes this type of harassment is sexual conduct--like someone repeatedly asking someone out for a date after they have said no (for example).
Sexual harassment can be hostility towards one gender (like a woman who is more critical of her male staff), or someone who makes repeated offensive jokes about someone because they do not fit their idea of a stereotypical "man" or "woman" (for example).
Deliberately misgendering someone such as by repeatedly using the wrong pronouns or refusing to use their lived name can be sexual harassment.
Sexual violence is conduct that is, by its nature, severe and understood to create an intimidate or offensive environment (and so to constitute sexual harassment).  The types of sexual violence are:
Sexual assault.  Sexual assault basically is sexual physical contact without consent.  There are two types of sexual assault, penetration and contact.  The full definition is found in the SVSH Policy.
Relationship violence, including dating violence and domestic violence.  Relationship violence basically is physical violence in the context of a close relationship and part of a pattern of abusive behavior.  Conduct that causes someone to fear physical violence may also be relationship violence (if, again, it is part of a pattern and in the context of a close relationship). The full definition is found in the SVSH Policy.
Stalking.   Stalking basically is repeated conduct that causes someone fear for their safety or substantial emotional distress, when the conduct is based on or motivated by sex (such as romantic interest).  Examples of stalking include following, monitoring, or surveilling. The full definition is found in the SVSH Policy.
Sexual Exploitation.  Taking sexual advantage of another, such as facilitating sexual assault, trafficking or prostituting another, or lying about contraception use in order to get someone to engage in a specific sexual act.
Retaliation is any conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from reporting sex-based harassment or participating in an investigation or resolution process, such as harassment or intimidation.  The full definition is found in the SVSH Policy.
The SVSH Policy also prohibits invasion of sexual privacy, sexual exploitation, exposure, sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 18, and failing to comply with a no-contact order or suspension or order of exclusion.
The SVSH Policy establishes the procedures UCR uses to resolve reports of sex-based harassment (conduct that violates the Policy).  There are different procedures available depending on whether the person reported to have engaged in the conduct is a student, faculty member, or staff, and whether the conduct is covered by the 2020 Title IX Regulations.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The SVSH Policy and UCR's jurisdiction are limited.   The Title IX Office resolution processes are most appropriate for matters that relate to current UCR students, employees (including volunteers), contractors/vendors, visitors, guests and patients), and that occurred:
off UCR property and outside a UCR program or activity but with continuing adverse effect on UCR property, program or activity.
Determining whether the Policy applies or whether or what process and measures may be used for a specific matter can be complicated; Title IX staff can answer questions you have about this, or you may read the Policy to learn more.  IMPORTANT NOTE: The current version of the Policy only applies to conduct alleged to have occurred on or after the effective date of the Policy.  Previous versions of the SVSH Policy and adjudication frameworks are archived on this website.
in January 2023, the office of the president proposed a new, systemwide non-discrimination policy. this policy is currently posted for notice and comment and is anticipated to go into effect in august 2023. The policy will make some changes to how ucr responds to reports and complaints of discrimination.
the u.s. department of education has proposed revisions to the title ix regulations. The proposed regulations were made available for notice-and-comment and the office of civil rights is currently preparing the final regulations, anticipated later in 2023. ocr made available a factsheet that provides information about the proposed regulations. these regulations are anticipated to result in changes to uc's policy on sexual violence and sexual harassment and to operations of the title ix/eoaa office.
in may 2023, the justice department and department of education address barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in online services, programs, and activities that colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions make available to students and the public.

The University is committed to non-discrimination, equal employment and affirmative action.  UCR respects the rights of all members of the campus community to equal opportunity  and freedom from harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, citizenship, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity, gender expression and gender transition status), pregnancy, age, disability (mental or physical), medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), genetic information (including family medical history), ancestry, service in the uniformed services (including protected veteran status), marital status, or any other characteristic protected by state or federal law.  The Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (Title IX/EOAA) is dedicated to protecting these rights through:
implementing UC and campus non-discrimination policies including the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH)
ensuring that UCR protects the rights of those with disabilities including under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
Title IX/EOAA handles reports and complaints of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and other conduct prohibited by anti-discrimination policies and the SVSH Policy.  You may also report incidents of bias, hate and intolerance.
Harassment is a form of discrimination, where the adverse treatment is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic that is intimidating, hostile or offensive and so severe or pervasive that it creates a hostile environment.
Retaliation is adverse action taken against someone for filing a complaint, participating in a complaint resolution process, or engaging in another protected activity.
The full definitions are provided in UCR's Discrimination, Harassment & Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Policy.
Your report will be promptly reviewed by Office staff.  Typically, we will reach out to you or the person identified as having experienced the discrimination, harassment or retaliation with information and resources and to connect for an intake meeting if appropriate.  Our flowcharts and FAQs provide more information about our assessment and response process.
This reporting form may also be used to report violations of the SVSH Policy; visit the Title IX at UCR website to learn more about the SVSH Policy and programs.
UCR encourages students, faculty, and staff to contact the Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action with complaints and concerns, so that we have the opportunity to work to address the concern.  We also provide information about how you may report discrimination, harassment (including sexual violence) and retaliation to regulatory entities, outside of UCR.

Title IX Officer and Complaint Resolution Officer Training | Title IX, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action
Title IX Officers and Complaint Resolution Officers participate in annual seminars and training sessions to stay up-to-date.
The University is committed to non-discrimination, equal employment and affirmative action.  UCR respects the rights of all members of the campus community to equal opportunity  and freedom from harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, citizenship, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity, gender expression and gender transition status), pregnancy, age, disability (mental or physical), medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), genetic information (including family medical history), ancestry, service in the uniformed services (including protected veteran status), marital status, or any other characteristic protected by state or federal law.  The Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (Title IX/EOAA) is dedicated to protecting these rights through:
implementing UC and campus non-discrimination policies including the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH)
ensuring that UCR protects the rights of those with disabilities including under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
Title IX/EOAA handles reports and complaints of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and other conduct prohibited by anti-discrimination policies and the SVSH Policy.  You may also report incidents of bias, hate and intolerance.
Harassment is a form of discrimination, where the adverse treatment is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic that is intimidating, hostile or offensive and so severe or pervasive that it creates a hostile environment.
Retaliation is adverse action taken against someone for filing a complaint, participating in a complaint resolution process, or engaging in another protected activity.
The full definitions are provided in UCR's Discrimination, Harassment & Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Policy.
Your report will be promptly reviewed by Office staff.  Typically, we will reach out to you or the person identified as having experienced the discrimination, harassment or retaliation with information and resources and to connect for an intake meeting if appropriate.  Our flowcharts and FAQs provide more information about our assessment and response process.
This reporting form may also be used to report violations of the SVSH Policy; visit the Title IX at UCR website to learn more about the SVSH Policy and programs.
UCR encourages students, faculty, and staff to contact the Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action with complaints and concerns, so that we have the opportunity to work to address the concern.  We also provide information about how you may report discrimination, harassment (including sexual violence) and retaliation to regulatory entities, outside of UCR.

Bias and hate incidents generally are conduct that targets or disparages people or groups based on actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics or categories.  See our FAQs for more information on the relationship of hate, bias, and harassment.  For definitions of different types of bias and other acts of intolerance, visit the UC Climate website.

File a Report of Harassment, Discrimination, Sexual Violence or other Prohibited Conduct | Title IX, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action
If you have experienced, witnessed or been informed of an incident of sexual harassment, sexual violence (sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking), retaliation or other conduct prohibited by the UC Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy, please file a report with us using the online reporting portal.
If you prefer to report in person, by phone, or email, you may contact the Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action to make a report or to schedule a meeting with a staff member.
If you are looking to report a different issue or concern, the help@UCR website can guide you to other campus offices and reporting options.
The online report is for UCR students, faculty, staff, or visitors. This includes incident reporting by non-confidential UCR employees, including student employees. (See "Do I Need to Report This?" if you have questions about employee reporting obligations.)  You may report anonymously, without giving us your name.  All reports are handled with discretion and respect.
Title IX/EOAA staff will assess the report to determine whether what you have reported is covered by our policies and the appropriate action.
In most cases, we reach out by email to the person who was reported to have experienced the prohibited conduct.  We provide information, including rights and options if relevant.  If they would like to meet with a staff member, we will discuss what steps could be taken to address the situation, and answer any questions.
To learn more about rights, options and resources for those reported to have experienced conduct prohibited by the SVSH Policy, see UCR's Rights & Options for Students and Rights & Options for Faculty & Staff
To learn more about resolution of other types of discrimination and harassment complaints, see our Frequently Asked Questions and flowcharts.

*Unless the University determines that the violation was egregious such as conduct that risked someone's health or safety, or involved plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty.

UC Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence Policies and Procedures | Title IX, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action
On this webpage, you can find the UC SVSH Policy and the procedures used to enforce the policy, which are called Investigation and Adjudication Frameworks.  Please use the pull-down menu above to access the document you are interested in.
On August 14, 2020, Title IX regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) went into effect.  Under these regulations, certain reports of conduct prohibited by the SVSH Policy must be addressed under a specific process mandated by the regulations, which the University refers to as the DOE Grievance Process.  The DOE Grievance Process may apply to conduct that:
off-campus (1) in the context of University operations, at a location, event or circumstances over which the University exercised substantial control over the respondent and the context in which the conduct occurred, or (2) at a building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the University; AND
was "sex-based conduct" as defined in the Title IX regulation, which includes harassment based on sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sex-or gender-stereotyping, or sexual orientation, if the conduct is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive.
If the conduct falls within the above-noted criteria, the university must address the conduct through the newly designated DOE Grievance Process. The DOE Grievance Process may involve a formal investigation, alternative resolution, or other inquiry. If a formal investigation is conducted, if either party does not accept the preliminary determination made in that investigation, a hearing will be conducted. Some of the notable changes on the process: (1) the insertion of a hearing following an investigation, and prior to policy determination; [1] (2) indirect questioning of parties and witnesses, through advisors who ask questions of the other party during a hearing; and (3) the University will provide a person to read the party's questions during a hearing if their advisor is not present or they do not have an advisor.
If the conduct does not fall within the above-noted criteria (i.e., other forms of Prohibited Conduct), the University will respond through its standard processes .  This could result in a formal investigations, alternative resolution, or other inquiry-or the matter could be considered closed. If a formal investigation is conducted, it would not involve a hearing unless the respondent is a student or a Senate faculty member.
If a case involves both DOE-Covered Conduct and other Prohibited Conduct, the University will respond under the DOE Grievance Process. The regulations are complex and, as a result, the SVSH Policy is also complex. The above overview summarizes the major changes within the updated policy. To further clarify these changes, the University developed initial FAQs that are available here, and will be updated as appropriate.
The regulations only apply to conduct that occurs on or after August 14, 2020. SVSH investigations pending before that date will proceed under the existing SVSH Policy. In addition, the regulations do not apply to the new reports of sexual harassment if the underlying conduct occurred prior to August 14, 2020.
No. All SVSH Policy requirements regarding Responsible Employees remain in effect. All UC Employees who are not confidential resources and become aware of the possible sexual violence or sexual harassment of students must report the information to the Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action at titleix@ucr.edu or https://titleix.ucr.edu/reporting.
Additional FAQs and other information are available online at the UC Office of the President and on UCR's Title IX website.
[1]This change was implemented in 2019 for student respondents in response to change in California case law. The current change of the hearing insertion now applies to cases that meet the DOE regulations and involve an employee respondent.
All proceedings are conducted by officials who receive annual training on issues related to Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, and how to conduct investigations and hearing processes that protect the safety of victims and promote accountability. For more information about the type of training received by investigators, case resolution officers, hearing officers, and adjudicators, visit the UCR Title IX Staff Training webpage.
Due to changes in law, the SVSH Policy has been revised several times.  The version of the policy that was in effect when the alleged conduct occurred, is the version that applies when we are reviewing or resolving a report.
For example, if we receive a report that alleges stalking that occurred in August 2019, we would apply the 2019 SVSH Policy, which was effective from July 2019-August 14, 2020.
The investigation and adjudication frameworks that govern resolution processes have also been amended several times.  We apply the version of the framework in place when the resolution process begins.

If we receive a report that relationship violence occurred on January 2, 2022, we would apply the current version of the SVSH Policy--the version in effect from January 1, 2022.
The investigation and adjudication frameworks that govern resolution processes have also been amended several times.  We apply the version of the framework in place when the resolution process begins.
Previous versions of UC SVSH policies and investigation procedures are collected here for the convenience of those involved in resolution of complaints covered by previous versions of policies and procedures. Title IX/EOAA staff can help you with any questions about the policy and framework. For older versions not provided on this website, please contact titleix@ucr.edu.
