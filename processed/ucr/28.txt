The University is committed to non-discrimination, equal employment and affirmative action.  UCR respects the rights of all members of the campus community to equal opportunity  and freedom from harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, citizenship, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity, gender expression and gender transition status), pregnancy, age, disability (mental or physical), medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), genetic information (including family medical history), ancestry, service in the uniformed services (including protected veteran status), marital status, or any other characteristic protected by state or federal law.  The Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (Title IX/EOAA) is dedicated to protecting these rights through:
implementing UC and campus non-discrimination policies including the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH)
ensuring that UCR protects the rights of those with disabilities including under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
Title IX/EOAA handles reports and complaints of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and other conduct prohibited by anti-discrimination policies and the SVSH Policy.  You may also report incidents of bias, hate and intolerance.
Harassment is a form of discrimination, where the adverse treatment is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic that is intimidating, hostile or offensive and so severe or pervasive that it creates a hostile environment.
Retaliation is adverse action taken against someone for filing a complaint, participating in a complaint resolution process, or engaging in another protected activity.
The full definitions are provided in UCR's Discrimination, Harassment & Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Policy.
Your report will be promptly reviewed by Office staff.  Typically, we will reach out to you or the person identified as having experienced the discrimination, harassment or retaliation with information and resources and to connect for an intake meeting if appropriate.  Our flowcharts and FAQs provide more information about our assessment and response process.
This reporting form may also be used to report violations of the SVSH Policy; visit the Title IX at UCR website to learn more about the SVSH Policy and programs.
UCR encourages students, faculty, and staff to contact the Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action with complaints and concerns, so that we have the opportunity to work to address the concern.  We also provide information about how you may report discrimination, harassment (including sexual violence) and retaliation to regulatory entities, outside of UCR.

UCR's Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action, as part of its mission to promote equity and create a working, living and learning climate free from discrimination and harassment, enforces UC anti-discrimination policies.  The two most important policies are the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, which we call the SVSH Policy, and UCR's Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Policy.  This website focuses on the SVSH Policy.  For information on the Discrimination Policy, which covers sex-based discrimination (and other types of discrimination and harassment, such as racial), please visit our main office website.
The SVSH Policy prohibits harassment based on sex.  It also prohibits retaliation for people who make a report of sexual harassment or engage in other protected activities.
Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct that is sexual in nature or otherwise based on sex and that is severe, persistent or pervasive and creates an intimidating or offensive environment.
Sometimes this type of harassment is sexual conduct--like someone repeatedly asking someone out for a date after they have said no (for example).
Sexual harassment can be hostility towards one gender (like a woman who is more critical of her male staff), or someone who makes repeated offensive jokes about someone because they do not fit their idea of a stereotypical "man" or "woman" (for example).
Deliberately misgendering someone such as by repeatedly using the wrong pronouns or refusing to use their lived name can be sexual harassment.
Sexual violence is conduct that is, by its nature, severe and understood to create an intimidate or offensive environment (and so to constitute sexual harassment).  The types of sexual violence are:
Sexual assault.  Sexual assault basically is sexual physical contact without consent.  There are two types of sexual assault, penetration and contact.  The full definition is found in the SVSH Policy.
Relationship violence, including dating violence and domestic violence.  Relationship violence basically is physical violence in the context of a close relationship and part of a pattern of abusive behavior.  Conduct that causes someone to fear physical violence may also be relationship violence (if, again, it is part of a pattern and in the context of a close relationship). The full definition is found in the SVSH Policy.
Stalking.   Stalking basically is repeated conduct that causes someone fear for their safety or substantial emotional distress, when the conduct is based on or motivated by sex (such as romantic interest).  Examples of stalking include following, monitoring, or surveilling. The full definition is found in the SVSH Policy.
Sexual Exploitation.  Taking sexual advantage of another, such as facilitating sexual assault, trafficking or prostituting another, or lying about contraception use in order to get someone to engage in a specific sexual act.
Retaliation is any conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from reporting sex-based harassment or participating in an investigation or resolution process, such as harassment or intimidation.  The full definition is found in the SVSH Policy.
The SVSH Policy also prohibits invasion of sexual privacy, sexual exploitation, exposure, sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 18, and failing to comply with a no-contact order or suspension or order of exclusion.
The SVSH Policy establishes the procedures UCR uses to resolve reports of sex-based harassment (conduct that violates the Policy).  There are different procedures available depending on whether the person reported to have engaged in the conduct is a student, faculty member, or staff, and whether the conduct is covered by the 2020 Title IX Regulations.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The SVSH Policy and UCR's jurisdiction are limited.   The Title IX Office resolution processes are most appropriate for matters that relate to current UCR students, employees (including volunteers), contractors/vendors, visitors, guests and patients), and that occurred:
off UCR property and outside a UCR program or activity but with continuing adverse effect on UCR property, program or activity.
Determining whether the Policy applies or whether or what process and measures may be used for a specific matter can be complicated; Title IX staff can answer questions you have about this, or you may read the Policy to learn more.  IMPORTANT NOTE: The current version of the Policy only applies to conduct alleged to have occurred on or after the effective date of the Policy.  Previous versions of the SVSH Policy and adjudication frameworks are archived on this website.
in January 2023, the office of the president proposed a new, systemwide non-discrimination policy. this policy is currently posted for notice and comment and is anticipated to go into effect in august 2023. The policy will make some changes to how ucr responds to reports and complaints of discrimination.
the u.s. department of education has proposed revisions to the title ix regulations. The proposed regulations were made available for notice-and-comment and the office of civil rights is currently preparing the final regulations, anticipated later in 2023. ocr made available a factsheet that provides information about the proposed regulations. these regulations are anticipated to result in changes to uc's policy on sexual violence and sexual harassment and to operations of the title ix/eoaa office.
in may 2023, the justice department and department of education address barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in online services, programs, and activities that colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions make available to students and the public.

Title IX Officer and Complaint Resolution Officer Training | Title IX, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action
Title IX Officers and Complaint Resolution Officers participate in annual seminars and training sessions to stay up-to-date.
The University is committed to non-discrimination, equal employment and affirmative action.  UCR respects the rights of all members of the campus community to equal opportunity  and freedom from harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, citizenship, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity, gender expression and gender transition status), pregnancy, age, disability (mental or physical), medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), genetic information (including family medical history), ancestry, service in the uniformed services (including protected veteran status), marital status, or any other characteristic protected by state or federal law.  The Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (Title IX/EOAA) is dedicated to protecting these rights through:
implementing UC and campus non-discrimination policies including the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH)
ensuring that UCR protects the rights of those with disabilities including under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
Title IX/EOAA handles reports and complaints of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and other conduct prohibited by anti-discrimination policies and the SVSH Policy.  You may also report incidents of bias, hate and intolerance.
Harassment is a form of discrimination, where the adverse treatment is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic that is intimidating, hostile or offensive and so severe or pervasive that it creates a hostile environment.
Retaliation is adverse action taken against someone for filing a complaint, participating in a complaint resolution process, or engaging in another protected activity.
The full definitions are provided in UCR's Discrimination, Harassment & Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Policy.
Your report will be promptly reviewed by Office staff.  Typically, we will reach out to you or the person identified as having experienced the discrimination, harassment or retaliation with information and resources and to connect for an intake meeting if appropriate.  Our flowcharts and FAQs provide more information about our assessment and response process.
This reporting form may also be used to report violations of the SVSH Policy; visit the Title IX at UCR website to learn more about the SVSH Policy and programs.
UCR encourages students, faculty, and staff to contact the Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action with complaints and concerns, so that we have the opportunity to work to address the concern.  We also provide information about how you may report discrimination, harassment (including sexual violence) and retaliation to regulatory entities, outside of UCR.

File a Report of Harassment, Discrimination, Sexual Violence or other Prohibited Conduct | Title IX, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action
If you have experienced, witnessed or been informed of an incident of sexual harassment, sexual violence (sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking), retaliation or other conduct prohibited by the UC Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy, please file a report with us using the online reporting portal.
If you prefer to report in person, by phone, or email, you may contact the Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action to make a report or to schedule a meeting with a staff member.
If you are looking to report a different issue or concern, the help@UCR website can guide you to other campus offices and reporting options.
The online report is for UCR students, faculty, staff, or visitors. This includes incident reporting by non-confidential UCR employees, including student employees. (See "Do I Need to Report This?" if you have questions about employee reporting obligations.)  You may report anonymously, without giving us your name.  All reports are handled with discretion and respect.
Title IX/EOAA staff will assess the report to determine whether what you have reported is covered by our policies and the appropriate action.
In most cases, we reach out by email to the person who was reported to have experienced the prohibited conduct.  We provide information, including rights and options if relevant.  If they would like to meet with a staff member, we will discuss what steps could be taken to address the situation, and answer any questions.
To learn more about rights, options and resources for those reported to have experienced conduct prohibited by the SVSH Policy, see UCR's Rights & Options for Students and Rights & Options for Faculty & Staff
