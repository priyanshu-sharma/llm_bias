The DOE�s promotion process ensures that students receive the support they need to succeed in the next grade level. For grades Kindergarten through 8, schools review many pieces of student work to determine if students are ready for the next grade level. For grades 9 through 12, schools make promotion decisions based on course credits.Talk to your student�s school about how this process applies to your student if:They have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or;They are an English Language Learner (ELL)Promotion Process and Timeline January � Early FebruarySchools identify students who are not on track to meeting promotion benchmarks at the end of the school year. Families of students whose promotion is in doubt receive an email or written notice in the mail. May � June Schools do promotion portfolios for students who may not be ready for the next grade level This is based on student work and assessments from throughout the school year. Principals make promotion decisions based on the English language arts and math skills shown in the student�s portfolio. Students in grade 8 must also pass the following courses in order to be promoted: EnglishMathSocial studiesScienceFamilies of students who are not promoted are notified by their schools.July Students who were not promoted in June must participate in summer learning.Any student may participate in summer learning, which provides academic support, arts, recreation, and social-emotional support. AugustAt the end of summer, principals make final promotion decisions based on students� portfolios and summer work.Families of students not promoted in June are notified. Families may appeal promotion decisions by submitting a written appeal to their student's principal. How do schools make promotion decisions?Promotion decisions are made by each school principal based on multiple measures of student readiness for the next grade level in English and math (as well as science and social studies for grade 8 students).Teachers review student work from the school year to identify students who may not be ready for the work of the next grade in English language arts and/or math, even with support. Students whose work shows they are ready for the next grade are promoted by the principal in June. If a student's work shows they may not be ready for the next grade level, the teacher completes and scores the portfolio. The principal makes the promotion decision based on the portfolio results. If your student is not promoted in June based on their portfolio results, your student is required to participate in summer learning. At the end of summer, the school reviews the progress of the student, and the principal makes the final promotion decision. How do schools determine which students get promotion portfolios? Schools prepare promotion portfolios for students whose work shows that they may not be ready for the next grade. This can be based on report card grades, student writing samples, projects, assessments, assignments, and other work chosen by the school.Schools do not prepare portfolios for students who show they are prepared for the next grade based on their work throughout the school year. The principal promotes these students in June. What can I do if I am not satisfied with the final promotion decision for my student? If you are not satisfied with the final promotion decision, you may contact the principal of your student's school appealing the decision at the end of August. The appeal will be reviewed by the superintendent, who makes the final decision. What if my student cannot participate in summer learning? Summer learning is an opportunity for students to develop the skills and knowledge needed for the next grade level. At the end of the summer, schools complete a review of students� portfolios with their summer work and assessments. If your student cannot attend summer learning, you may still submit a written appeal to the principal by the end of August but you may find it difficult to demonstrate that your student is prepared for the next grade level.

The goal is to help them see how their actions affect others. For example, your child can:Write a letter apologizing to the student who was bullied.Do a good deed for the person who was bullied or for others in your community.Clean up, repair, or pay for any property they damaged.Speak with their school counselor or administrator.Work with your child�s school if you think additional referrals or resources are needed.Sometimes children bully to fit in. Your child can benefit from participating in positive activities. Involvement in sports and clubs can enable him/her to take leadership roles and make friends without feeling the need to bully.Other times kids act out because something else�issues at home, abuse, stress�is going on in their lives. They also may have been bullied. These kids may be in need of additional support, such as mental health services.

The DOE�s promotion process ensures that students receive the support they need to succeed in the next grade level. For grades Kindergarten through 8, schools review many pieces of student work to determine if students are ready for the next grade level. For grades 9 through 12, schools make promotion decisions based on course credits.Talk to your student�s school about how this process applies to your student if:They have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or;They are an English Language Learner (ELL)Promotion Process and Timeline January � Early FebruarySchools identify students who are not on track to meeting promotion benchmarks at the end of the school year. Families of students whose promotion is in doubt receive an email or written notice in the mail. May � June Schools do promotion portfolios for students who may not be ready for the next grade level This is based on student work and assessments from throughout the school year. Principals make promotion decisions based on the English language arts and math skills shown in the student�s portfolio. Students in grade 8 must also pass the following courses in order to be promoted: EnglishMathSocial studiesScienceFamilies of students who are not promoted are notified by their schools.July Students who were not promoted in June must participate in summer learning.Any student may participate in summer learning, which provides academic support, arts, recreation, and social-emotional support. AugustAt the end of summer, principals make final promotion decisions based on students� portfolios and summer work.Families of students not promoted in June are notified. Families may appeal promotion decisions by submitting a written appeal to their student's principal. How do schools make promotion decisions?Promotion decisions are made by each school principal based on multiple measures of student readiness for the next grade level in English and math (as well as science and social studies for grade 8 students).Teachers review student work from the school year to identify students who may not be ready for the work of the next grade in English language arts and/or math, even with support. Students whose work shows they are ready for the next grade are promoted by the principal in June. If a student's work shows they may not be ready for the next grade level, the teacher completes and scores the portfolio. The principal makes the promotion decision based on the portfolio results. If your student is not promoted in June based on their portfolio results, your student is required to participate in summer learning. At the end of summer, the school reviews the progress of the student, and the principal makes the final promotion decision. How do schools determine which students get promotion portfolios? Schools prepare promotion portfolios for students whose work shows that they may not be ready for the next grade. This can be based on report card grades, student writing samples, projects, assessments, assignments, and other work chosen by the school.Schools do not prepare portfolios for students who show they are prepared for the next grade based on their work throughout the school year. The principal promotes these students in June. What can I do if I am not satisfied with the final promotion decision for my student? If you are not satisfied with the final promotion decision, you may contact the principal of your student's school appealing the decision at the end of August. The appeal will be reviewed by the superintendent, who makes the final decision. What if my student cannot participate in summer learning? Summer learning is an opportunity for students to develop the skills and knowledge needed for the next grade level. At the end of the summer, schools complete a review of students� portfolios with their summer work and assessments. If your student cannot attend summer learning, you may still submit a written appeal to the principal by the end of August but you may find it difficult to demonstrate that your student is prepared for the next grade level.

The goal is to help them see how their actions affect others. For example, your child can:Write a letter apologizing to the student who was bullied.Do a good deed for the person who was bullied or for others in your community.Clean up, repair, or pay for any property they damaged.Speak with their school counselor or administrator.Work with your child�s school if you think additional referrals or resources are needed.Sometimes children bully to fit in. Your child can benefit from participating in positive activities. Involvement in sports and clubs can enable him/her to take leadership roles and make friends without feeling the need to bully.Other times kids act out because something else�issues at home, abuse, stress�is going on in their lives. They also may have been bullied. These kids may be in need of additional support, such as mental health services.

Survivors are in the position of control to decide what happens after an incident of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, occurs.
Schools must respect a survivor�s decision to file, or not to file, a formal complaint and must offer supportive measures either way.
Schools must respond promptly in every instance by offering to provide supportive measures like dorm reassignments or class schedule adjustments
Schools are forbidden from pressuring a survivor into filing or not filing a formal complaint or participating in a grievance process.
To protect younger students, K-12 schools must respond promptly when any school employee has notice of sexual harassment, including sexual assault.
The regulation extends to all aspects of a school�s education program or activity and applies to any building owned or controlled by a student organization recognized by a college or university.
If a survivor chooses to participate in a grievance process, the regulation protects survivors from inappropriately being asked about prior sexual history (also known as �rape shield� protections), and the survivor must not be required to divulge any medical, psychological, or similarly privileged records.
A survivor never has to come face-to-face with the accused during a hearing, and an accused is never allowed to personally ask questions of a survivor.
Survivors are protected against retaliation when they choose to report sexual misconduct or not, file a formal complaint or not, participate in a grievance process or not.
The regulation provides students with a right to written notice of allegations, the right to an advocate, and the right to submit, examine, and challenge evidence.
All students have the right to an impartial finding based on evidence using a standard of evidence � either the preponderance of evidence standard or the clear and convincing standard � that applies to all members of the school community, including faculty.
