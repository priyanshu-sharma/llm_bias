current page: Sexual Misconduct
University of Utah policy prohibits sex discrimination, which includes sexual misconduct.
Sexual Misconduct is the most egregious form of sex discrimination. Title IX of the
Education Amendments Act of 1972 is the comprehensive federal law that prohibits discrimination
on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity.
Policies, procedures, and resources are in place to take immediate and appropriate
steps to remedy violations of University policy and the university will take steps
to end or eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence and to remedy
the effects, as appropriate under each individual’s circumstances.
Complaints of sexual misconduct should be made directly to the Office of Equal Opportunity
Please see the Title IX Coordinator Outreach letter to learn about your specific rights to seek out Supportive Measures and options for
accountability through the OEO/AA process or through law enforcement.

in a university program activity;
Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
or a factor in decisions affecting that individual’s employment, education, living
environment, or participation in a university program or activity; or
Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual’s employment
or educational performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment
for that individual’s employment, education, living environment, or participation

the situation may be reported to the OEO/AA, you have the right to choose to whom
you speak, what you say, when you say it and what resources you use. If you prefer
to speak first with a confidential resource (confidential resources are not required
to report information to the OEO/AA, you may contact one of the groups below.
Information provided to OEO/AA is considered private information and will only be shared with other appropriate university personnel on
a very strict need-to-know basis.

Discrimination is partiality or bias in the treatment of a person or group that is
unfair or violates law or policy. Treating someone differently based on a protected class violates University policy. A protected class is a group of people protected against
discrimination by University policy or by state and federal law.

What is Discriminatory Harassment?
The University’s nondiscrimination policy applies broadly to students, employees,
and visitors. Hostile environment is a commonly used term but from a legal and policy
perspective, a hostile environment is a form of discriminatory harassment.
Harassment means unwelcome or offensive conduct which has the purpose or effect of
interfering with an individuals’ work or academic environment or creating an intimidating
hostile, offensive or otherwise working or learning environment based upon a person’s
race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity, gender expression, or protected veteran’s status. The University’s
Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA) is responsible for the
University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Many people have heard the term “hostile environment” in the context of sexual harassment
but a “hostile environment” can also include harassment because of race, color, national
origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and
protected veteran’s status. For harassment not related to discrimination, contact
What constitutes a hostile environment? What are the range of scenarios that people
A hostile environment can be created in many ways. Verbal comments, text messages,
pictures, graphics, graffiti and physical conduct can create a hostile environment.
This might look like racial slurs, comments about a person’s national origin, or behavior
or words that mock, demean, put down, disparage, threaten or ridicule others based
upon race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity/expression and protected veteran’s status.
An isolated statement, even if rude and offensive, generally does not constitute a
hostile environment. Occasional insensitive and off-hand comments, even if inappropriate
or unprofessional, will generally not create a hostile environment. The focus is whether
the behavior, as a whole, affecting a person’s education or working environment. In order to interfere with a person’s work or educational environment, generally
the conduct must be severe, recurring and pervasive so that it interferes with your
ability to fulfill your work and academic pursuits.
Although an occasional comment may not constitute a violation of the University’s
nondiscrimination policy, other provisions of University policy governing student
and employee conduct may apply. It is important to mention that the University, in
terms of student, visitor, and employee conduct, has an interest in preventing discrimination
and harassment. For example, if a department has an employee who tells an inappropriate
joke then other employees begin to participate in similar types of comments, believing
that such behavior is condoned, the workplace can then develop into a hostile environment
for those that find such conduct unwelcome and offensive.
If someone feels like they are experiencing a hostile environment, what options are
open to them to deal with the situation?
The first step is to tell the individual that their comments are unwelcome and unwanted.
Sometimes this may be difficult but once you have made it clear that their comments
are not welcome, the individual has clearly been notified that you find their behavior
unwelcome and offensive. Once the individual clearly understands the behavior isn’t
welcome yet continues to engage in similar behavior, disciplinary action may be appropriate.
There are many options on the University campus that can assist you in addressing
the unwanted and unwelcome behavior. The Office of the Dean of Students, Human Resources, and the Office of Equal Opportunity are all avenues that can assist you in addressing
How are issues like these handled to protect the person dealing with hostility while
also being fair to the Respondent?
The Office of Equal Opportunity is neutral and impartial whose purpose in an investigation
is to determine the facts. Both parties are provided an opportunity to provide their
side of the story. Obtaining both the perspective of the person dealing with the hostility
as well as the person alleged to have engaged in the behavior is important in terms
of treating both parties fairly. Although both parties are given an opportunity to
provide their side of the story, it is important to remember that it doesn’t matter
whether the behavior was intended to hurt the other individual. An investigation by
the Office of Equal Opportunity would look at whether a reasonable person would take
offense to the unwanted or unwelcome behavior.
University policy prohibits retaliation against an individual for having made a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, hearing, or
proceeding under the University’s nondiscrimination policies or for interfering with
the rights of individuals under the University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Examples of retaliation include:
demoting, disciplining, or harassing an employee because the employee files or reports
discrimination or sexual misconduct to OEO/AA
interfering with witnesses or others who may be interviewed as part of an investigation
giving a lower grade because a student does not accede to sexual advances
If you believe you have experienced discriminatory conduct, including sexual misconduct,
or retaliation, you may file a complaint with our office.

University of Utah policy prohibits sex discrimination, which includes sexual misconduct.
Sexual Misconduct is the most egregious form of sex discrimination. Title IX of the
Education Amendments Act of 1972 is the comprehensive federal law that prohibits discrimination
on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity.
Policies, procedures, and resources are in place to take immediate and appropriate
steps to remedy violations of University policy and the university will take steps
to end or eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence and to remedy
the effects, as appropriate under each individual’s circumstances.
Complaints of sexual misconduct should be made directly to the Office of Equal Opportunity
Please see the Title IX Coordinator Outreach letter to learn about your specific rights to seek out Supportive Measures and options for
accountability through the OEO/AA process or through law enforcement.

in a university program activity;
Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for

Discrimination is partiality or bias in the treatment of a person or group that is
unfair or violates law or policy. Treating someone differently based on a protected class violates University policy. A protected class is a group of people protected against
discrimination by University policy or by state and federal law.

What is Discriminatory Harassment?
The University’s nondiscrimination policy applies broadly to students, employees,
and visitors. Hostile environment is a commonly used term but from a legal and policy
perspective, a hostile environment is a form of discriminatory harassment.
Harassment means unwelcome or offensive conduct which has the purpose or effect of
interfering with an individuals’ work or academic environment or creating an intimidating
hostile, offensive or otherwise working or learning environment based upon a person’s
race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity, gender expression, or protected veteran’s status. The University’s
Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA) is responsible for the
University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Many people have heard the term “hostile environment” in the context of sexual harassment
but a “hostile environment” can also include harassment because of race, color, national
origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and
protected veteran’s status. For harassment not related to discrimination, contact
What constitutes a hostile environment? What are the range of scenarios that people
A hostile environment can be created in many ways. Verbal comments, text messages,
pictures, graphics, graffiti and physical conduct can create a hostile environment.
This might look like racial slurs, comments about a person’s national origin, or behavior
or words that mock, demean, put down, disparage, threaten or ridicule others based
upon race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity/expression and protected veteran’s status.
An isolated statement, even if rude and offensive, generally does not constitute a
hostile environment. Occasional insensitive and off-hand comments, even if inappropriate
or unprofessional, will generally not create a hostile environment. The focus is whether
the behavior, as a whole, affecting a person’s education or working environment. In order to interfere with a person’s work or educational environment, generally
the conduct must be severe, recurring and pervasive so that it interferes with your
ability to fulfill your work and academic pursuits.
Although an occasional comment may not constitute a violation of the University’s
nondiscrimination policy, other provisions of University policy governing student
and employee conduct may apply. It is important to mention that the University, in
terms of student, visitor, and employee conduct, has an interest in preventing discrimination
and harassment. For example, if a department has an employee who tells an inappropriate
joke then other employees begin to participate in similar types of comments, believing
that such behavior is condoned, the workplace can then develop into a hostile environment
for those that find such conduct unwelcome and offensive.
If someone feels like they are experiencing a hostile environment, what options are
open to them to deal with the situation?
The first step is to tell the individual that their comments are unwelcome and unwanted.
Sometimes this may be difficult but once you have made it clear that their comments
are not welcome, the individual has clearly been notified that you find their behavior
unwelcome and offensive. Once the individual clearly understands the behavior isn’t
welcome yet continues to engage in similar behavior, disciplinary action may be appropriate.
There are many options on the University campus that can assist you in addressing
the unwanted and unwelcome behavior. The Office of the Dean of Students, Human Resources, and the Office of Equal Opportunity are all avenues that can assist you in addressing
How are issues like these handled to protect the person dealing with hostility while
also being fair to the Respondent?
The Office of Equal Opportunity is neutral and impartial whose purpose in an investigation
is to determine the facts. Both parties are provided an opportunity to provide their
side of the story. Obtaining both the perspective of the person dealing with the hostility
as well as the person alleged to have engaged in the behavior is important in terms
of treating both parties fairly. Although both parties are given an opportunity to
provide their side of the story, it is important to remember that it doesn’t matter
whether the behavior was intended to hurt the other individual. An investigation by
the Office of Equal Opportunity would look at whether a reasonable person would take
offense to the unwanted or unwelcome behavior.
University policy prohibits retaliation against an individual for having made a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, hearing, or
proceeding under the University’s nondiscrimination policies or for interfering with
the rights of individuals under the University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Examples of retaliation include:
demoting, disciplining, or harassing an employee because the employee files or reports
discrimination or sexual misconduct to OEO/AA
interfering with witnesses or others who may be interviewed as part of an investigation
giving a lower grade because a student does not accede to sexual advances
If you believe you have experienced discriminatory conduct, including sexual misconduct,
or retaliation, you may file a complaint with our office.
