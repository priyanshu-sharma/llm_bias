Title IX and the future of gender equity on college campuses
Posted on: June 21, 2022; Updated on: June 21, 2022By
Page Ivey, pivey@mailbox.sc.edu, 803-777-3085
Molly Peirano, a University of South Carolina alumna who recently led Title IX engagement
and education initiatives at Ohio State University, has been leading the university’s
new Office of Civil Rights and Title IX.
On the 50th anniversary of Title IX, UofSC Today talked with Peirano about her plans and goals
for the office and the future of the landmark civil rights regulation that prohibits
sex discrimination in any education program receiving federal funds.
Historically, Title IX has focused a lot on athletics, how would you describe the
Often when I'm trying to explain what Title IX is, I start back at the beginning.
There was a woman at the University of Maryland who earned her Ph.D. and, when she
was trying to get hired, would hear things like, ‘We already have a woman in this
department.’ ‘You come on too strong for a woman.’ Her name was Bernice Sandler, went
by Bunny. And she's actually known as the ‘Godmother of Title IX.’
Sometimes we forget that this started as a faculty issue. When people look back at
history, they think a lot of the athletic aspect, which was very important and brought
a lot of attention that was well deserved. Now I would say we're more in the era of
sexual misconduct and preventing it, keeping people safe.
But I do hope that we can bring some of the attention back to faculty issues and employment
and scholarship. Even though we've made great strides in equity in those areas, we
The main message I want people to get is ‘We want you to be treated well by us and
by one another, regardless of what your identity is.’
What is a contemporary issue that is being seen on campuses that you would like to
If you look at the number of tenured faculty, you will still see that women are behind
in those spaces, even just looking at the sheer number. I think looking at those pieces
is helpful. Another part that often is not talked about in Title IX is pregnant and
parenting students, who are protected under Title IX.
I am working on a Ph.D. and that's my area of study. And I can tell you over the last
four years, there has been more research done in that space. How do we support pregnant
students — keep them on our campuses, accommodate them so that they can have their
children? Or if they have a miscarriage, are they able to re-enter or maybe not even
leave, just have accommodation? I think that's an area that has not gotten the attention
What has been your first order of business in this position?
One of the first orders of business has been to create a comprehensive policy that
is anti-discrimination, anti-harassment and anti-sexual misconduct. Right now, there's
quite a few policies and it can be confusing for people to follow. And my thing with
policy is people need to know what the expectations are if we want them to meet those
expectations. Most people want to do the right thing. They just need to know what
to do. We're creating one comprehensive policy, and we'll retire about six other policies.
I think that'll help communicate our expectations to the community, let people know
what their rights are, and it will help us be more efficient and effective in our
We are also adding staff. Two of the first hires that I made are for what we're calling
an intake function. When people come to the office, they have someone to share their
experience with who can help go through what their immediate resources are then what
their resolution options are. We want to restore agency back to people. We want to
make sure that instead of just rushing it to an investigation or something like that,
that people have time to think through what their options are and talk to someone
Molly Peirano says she gets to meet a lot of people when she takes her dog Monty for
How are you going about creating this new policy?
There's a university policy process that we are following. We are doing some benchmarking
from other institutions, and we've also heard the feedback from people who are currently
here about what's working and what's not, as well as our own expertise having done
We also are getting feedback from different stakeholders across the institution. We've
had a couple folks look at it from a faculty perspective, from an administration perspective.
I also visited the undergraduate student government and let them know I would be sending
a copy for feedback. I'm trying to get input from different folks, but we also want
to have it in place by the beginning of the new school year so we can have a fresh
start and launch our office more publicly.
I tell people, ‘We don't want to put up a new front door if there's nothing new behind
it.’ We wanted any publicity to coincide with the policy, so people see we are delivering
something more streamlined, easier to understand.
How did you get into this this line of work?
I knew I wanted to be in higher education. I had worked in sorority and fraternity
life when I was an undergrad. Then I was a consultant and went to a lot of different
college campuses. And I went back to school and got my master's — at the University
of South Carolina — and I worked in student conduct while I was there. When I moved
back to Ohio after grad school, I did not have a role that I wanted to accept yet.
So I volunteered and got trained as a hospital advocate. I would go into the hospitals
and be present with survivors of sexual assault while they were going through their
nurse-examiner experience. After that, I realized that was an area I wanted to work
Eventually I got a role at Ohio State in Title IX, which I think kind of coupled the
student conduct — the expectations/accountability piece — with the victim/survivor
support piece. And it kind of brought those two worlds together.
I was in the Title IX job at Ohio State when I went to a wedding for a graduate school
classmate, and someone said South Carolina was opening a Title IX office and ‘You
could just come back and work with us.’ I looked at the posting and realized that
it was a similar office to what I had done at Ohio State. And USC is an institution
that means a lot to me. I knew there were going to be challenges, but I really think
that the people at USC deserve having that access, having their options presented
in an easy-to-understand way. So I just put my name in and thought, ‘Well, if it's
What is your early impression of the university’s commitment to working on these issues?
I was very impressed with all the work that had been done before I got here. You had
the Title IX task force and its report. There was a lot of acknowledgement that there
is a better way for us to serve people in this space. So I definitely appreciated
that. I am also very grateful for how they've situated the office — I report to the
president's chief of staff, which I think is very wise. And so it shows me that this
is a priority for the institution and they strategically placed it so that we can
be integrated in the work of the university but also have the autonomy to do what
is right. I think that is very powerful for an institution.
Before I even came to USC, I got a call from President-elect Michael Amiridis, and
he shared how important this work was and that he was looking forward to working together
on this. To me, that said a lot that a president was willing and able to say that
this is a priority. Based on the work he did where he's coming from, it's not just
that he's saying it, he really lives it.
Do you ever foresee a time when it won't be necessary to have a Title IX coordinator
I think that anyone who's in prevention work hopes that they can work themselves out
of a job. And honestly, there's so much work to do, not just at USC, but I would say
nationwide. I would love to say, of course we can get there. But I do think that sometimes
we get complacent, and people think ‘Oh, it's improved from 1972, so we're in good
shape.’ But like I said, if you look at the percentage of tenured faculty or if you
look at the pregnant and parenting students or the other areas, we have to stay on
top of it. If we don't keep it top of mind, it's easy to slide back and we still have
so much work to do. I know people deserve better.
People need to know what the expectations are if we want them to meet those expectations.
Most people want to do the right thing. They just need to know what to do.
Your work is very intense. How do you relax? What do you do for fun?
I love to travel, so I'm very excited that it is kind of becoming more available and
I have a little 3-pound teacup Yorkie that I love to spend time with. His name is
Monty, so he is a bundle of fun. I had a late meeting with students one night and
I had just moved, so I didn't want to leave him alone yet. So I brought him. And as
I was walking him across campus, I met more people with him than I had the whole first
month I was here. So I told I told my boss, this could be a good idea just to walk
him around campus every couple of weeks and meet a bunch of people.
I also try to work out because I always tell my employees in the office, ‘You have
to be well, to do well.’ So I do try to run and exercise throughout the week.
I volunteer for other organizations because to your point, this can be so heavy. So
it's nice to have like other things that require your time and attention. I volunteer
with Delta Gamma, which is an international sorority. I work with different collegians
across the country, and that's rejuvenating.
Is there anything else you would like to add?
I think the biggest thing about Title IX is there's all these other areas from recruitment
to admissions to helping people have a good experience while they're here that we
don't talk about. We should look at how are we bringing people to our institution
and making sure that they have the learning and working environment that they deserve
so they can go on and do great things. The main message I want people to get is ‘We
want you to be treated well by us and by one another, regardless of what your identity

The Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive
Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Action item No. 3, from the president’s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the president’s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,

Investigator, Decision Maker, and Appeals Officer Training Introduction
The Title IX Task Force was charged by former President Caslen to critically evaluate
the institution’s effectiveness in addressing sexual harassment and violence (SHV)
and to offer recommendations to enhance the institution’s effectiveness in addressing
Guided by principles of respect, accountability, and empowerment, the Task Force believes
that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve processes to support the needs of
both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings point to several
such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the
diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community safe each day.
The annual rate of reported cases of SHV was fairly stable, relative to the growth
in the institution’s size. The rates are lower than estimated national rates of SHV.
Most complaints concerned students against other students. Incidents involving faculty
respondents and student complaints were relatively rare.
Training for stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, managers) and for implementers
(staff providing SHV services) are all lacking in frequency and customized content.
Of note is the need for specialized training for professionals directly involved in
addressing SHV and managers of employees involved in cases of SHV.
The current reporting system is difficult to navigate, and the process of reporting
is an adverse and potentially re-traumatizing experience, creating significant barriers
Few reported cases are formally investigated, with a large proportion of complainants
opting out. Further, cases against faculty are less likely to result in a reasonable
cause finding than those against student and staff.
There is no faculty-governed process for disciplinary action short of termination
for faculty. Further, there is inconsistency in documentation and execution of discipline
for faculty and staff. There is a lack of guidelines regarding handling conduct that
falls short of policy violation but is nonetheless inappropriate.
There is a lack of continual review of risk to the complainant, which may undermine
measures to protect against further harassment and retaliation. While support is offered
to student respondents through the Respondent Resource Committee, in practice, few
student respondents utilize these services.
Staffing, job scope, reporting structures, and coordinating mechanisms require attention.
There is a lack of centralized information management and public reporting. The culture
of the institution and students does not reflect a shared commitment to addressing
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
effectively to SHV. Specifically we recommend:
Increase the frequency and tracking of training and education activities and expand
Improve both complainant and respondent experiences through the reporting and investigating
process by reviewing all websites, forms and communications to be more user-friendly,
interpersonally sensitive and non-threatening to both complainant and respondent.
Develop and maintain investigative protocols and rubrics for evaluations of cases.
Document cases in a manner that is consistent with protocols and rubrics. Review cases
to assure adherence to policy, protocols and rubrics.
Create a system to assure that the disciplinary actions are consistently delivered.
Create guidelines for corrective action and monitoring of inappropriate behavior that
falls short of policy violation. Develop procedures for consistent, thorough and centralized
record keeping of disciplinary and corrective action. Revise the Faculty Manual and/or
policy to address faculty misconduct and discipline.
Develop trauma-informed first responder protocols to ensure that no matter which reporting
office receives the report, the complainant receives consistent information about
support services and reporting options. Continually assess ongoing risk to complainants
and revise supportive measures accordingly.
Evaluate the organization structure to maximize effectiveness with particular attention
to deputy Title IX coordinator role, the coordination between academic units and the
SHV offices, and the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) line of reporting.
Consolidate information management and annual reporting. Work toward a culture of
The work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university community’s

Initially announced on March 15, 2021 and then formally launched on March 26, the
Title IX Task Force is an interdisciplinary team of students, faculty and staff formed
to undertake a comprehensive review of processes, policies, communications, training
and historic activity, and determine institutional capacity and effectiveness to support
the safety of the community and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment or
In the two months that followed, the 15 Task Force members – under the leadership of Dr. Kirsten Kennedy, associate vice president for Housing
and Sustainability and Dr. Audrey Korsgaard, chair-elect of the Faculty Senate and
professor of Management and director of the Riegel and Emory Human Resources Center
at the Darla Moore School of Business – reviewed policies, studied procedures, tracked
training, studied existing education and programs, interviewed subject matter experts,
and considered resourcing levels currently in use across the university. With support
from the nationally recognized team from Cozen O’Connor’s Institutional Response Group,
the final report of the Task Force identifies areas for further review and offers
insight into ways the university can improve the campus safety environment and create
an ecosystem of care for those impacted by interpersonal violence.
Simultaneous to the Task Force process, the Board of Trustees tasked Audit and Advisory
Services with the responsibility to review select historic cases and determine compliance
with applicable policies, regulations and laws in place to govern Title IX activity.
The report, titled "Title IX Process Review for Select Cases," was issued to the Board
View the Audit and Advisory Services Report »
While the work of the Audit and Advisory Services team found university policies and
procedures met the appropriate national standards and requirements that govern the
university’s work in this area, the Task Force recognizes those standards create a
threshold of compliance, and believes that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve
upon processes for continuous review and strengthening of systems that balance and
support the needs of both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings
point to several such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution
has made and the diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
Finally, the work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university
community’s response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report
serves to guide the work of the Implementation Group and Cozen O’Connor who will continue
to work with members of the Task Force and key university leaders to further develop
Both the Task Force Report and the Audit and Advisory Services Report were released
in a letter from Interim President Harris Pastides to all students, faculty and staff on July 1, 2021.
With the findings of both the Audit and Advisory Services case review and the Task
Force report serving as the foundation for understanding, the university has assembled
an implementation group charged by Interim President Harris Pastides with the responsibility to quickly develop

related to Title IX and interpersonal violence. The group is co-led by Dr. Stacy Fritz

The Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive
Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Action item No. 3, from the president’s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the president’s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,
policies, training, communications, historic activity, capacity and effectiveness.

Investigator, Decision Maker, and Appeals Officer Training Introduction
The Title IX Task Force was charged by former President Caslen to critically evaluate
the institution’s effectiveness in addressing sexual harassment and violence (SHV)
and to offer recommendations to enhance the institution’s effectiveness in addressing
Guided by principles of respect, accountability, and empowerment, the Task Force believes
that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve processes to support the needs of
both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings point to several
such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the
diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community safe each day.
The annual rate of reported cases of SHV was fairly stable, relative to the growth
in the institution’s size. The rates are lower than estimated national rates of SHV.
Most complaints concerned students against other students. Incidents involving faculty
respondents and student complaints were relatively rare.
Training for stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, managers) and for implementers
(staff providing SHV services) are all lacking in frequency and customized content.
Of note is the need for specialized training for professionals directly involved in
addressing SHV and managers of employees involved in cases of SHV.
The current reporting system is difficult to navigate, and the process of reporting
is an adverse and potentially re-traumatizing experience, creating significant barriers
Few reported cases are formally investigated, with a large proportion of complainants
opting out. Further, cases against faculty are less likely to result in a reasonable
cause finding than those against student and staff.
There is no faculty-governed process for disciplinary action short of termination
for faculty. Further, there is inconsistency in documentation and execution of discipline
for faculty and staff. There is a lack of guidelines regarding handling conduct that
falls short of policy violation but is nonetheless inappropriate.
There is a lack of continual review of risk to the complainant, which may undermine
measures to protect against further harassment and retaliation. While support is offered
to student respondents through the Respondent Resource Committee, in practice, few
student respondents utilize these services.
Staffing, job scope, reporting structures, and coordinating mechanisms require attention.
There is a lack of centralized information management and public reporting. The culture
of the institution and students does not reflect a shared commitment to addressing
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants

all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
effectively to SHV. Specifically we recommend:
Increase the frequency and tracking of training and education activities and expand
Improve both complainant and respondent experiences through the reporting and investigating
process by reviewing all websites, forms and communications to be more user-friendly,
interpersonally sensitive and non-threatening to both complainant and respondent.
Develop and maintain investigative protocols and rubrics for evaluations of cases.
Document cases in a manner that is consistent with protocols and rubrics. Review cases
to assure adherence to policy, protocols and rubrics.
Create a system to assure that the disciplinary actions are consistently delivered.
Create guidelines for corrective action and monitoring of inappropriate behavior that
falls short of policy violation. Develop procedures for consistent, thorough and centralized
record keeping of disciplinary and corrective action. Revise the Faculty Manual and/or
policy to address faculty misconduct and discipline.
Develop trauma-informed first responder protocols to ensure that no matter which reporting
office receives the report, the complainant receives consistent information about
support services and reporting options. Continually assess ongoing risk to complainants
and revise supportive measures accordingly.
Evaluate the organization structure to maximize effectiveness with particular attention
to deputy Title IX coordinator role, the coordination between academic units and the
SHV offices, and the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) line of reporting.
Consolidate information management and annual reporting. Work toward a culture of

The University of South Carolina recognizes that a welcoming, supportive environment
is essential for students to succeed, thrive, and realize their full potential. It
is the desire and intent of the University to foster and maintain a welcoming environment
for all its students, including pregnant and parenting students who are faced with
challenges in addition to those that come with being a student.
Expand all1. Federal law prohibits sex discrimination (which includes discrimination based on
pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions).
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits sex discrimination
in any educational program or activity that receives federal funds. This includes
the University of South Carolina. Title IX is found in the United States Code at Title
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...
Title IX also prohibits discrimination against pregnant or parenting students participating
in such programs or activities. Specifically, Part 106.40 of Title 34 of the Code
A recipient [of federal funds, such as the University of South Carolina] shall not
apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital
status which treats students differently on the basis of sex.
The regulations make clear that there are certain actions colleges and universities
receiving federal funds cannot take, and that there are certain actions that colleges
The University of South Carolina cannot discriminate against any student because of
the student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or
The University of South Carolina cannot exclude any student from its education programs
or activities because of the student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination
of pregnancy or recovery from any of these conditions, unless the student requests
voluntarily to participate in a separate or special portion of any program or activity.
The University of South Carolina cannot require a doctor to certify a pregnant student
is physically and emotionally able to continue participation in a program or activity,
unless such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional
conditions requiring the attention of a doctor. This means the university cannot treat
pregnant students differently from other students being treated by doctors, even when
pregnant students are in the later stages of pregnancy.
Even though colleges and universities should not presume pregnant students are unable
to attend school or participate in school activities, this does not mean that a college
or university that receives federal funds may not be required to provide accommodations
for pregnant students to allow them to attend school.
To ensure a pregnant student’s access to its educational programs or activities, when
necessary, a school must make adjustments to its regular programs that are reasonable
and responsive to the student’s temporary pregnancy status. For example, a school
may be required to provide a larger desk, allow frequent or longer bathroom breaks,
or make other reasonable accommodations.
A college or university that receives federal funds must treat pregnancy, childbirth,
false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from any of these conditions
the same as it treats any other temporary disability regarding any medical or hospital
benefit, service, plan or policy which the college or university offers or operates
for students admitted to its educational program or activity.
The University of South Carolina must treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy,
termination of pregnancy and recovery from any of these conditions as an excused absence
for the period of time deemed medically necessary by the student's physician. At the
conclusion of that period of absence, the university must reinstate the student to
the status which she held when the leave began.
This “reinstatement” should include giving the student the opportunity to make up
any work that was missed. The university may offer the student alternatives to making
up missed work. This may involve allowing the student to repeat or retake a course
or allowing the student additional time in a program to continue at the same pace
and finish at a later date, especially after longer periods of leave. This should
involve an interactive process between the student and the instructor.
However, in considering requests for accommodations, the university is not required
to grant an accommodation that would fundamentally alter any university program or
activity, or that would constitute an undue financial or administrative burden on
In addition to the above requirements of Title IX, harassing a student because of
pregnancy may violate Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination. Harassing
conduct can take many forms, including verbal (oral) as well as graphic and physical

2. University policy prohibits sex discrimination (which includes discrimination based
on pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions).
Discrimination or harassment based on age, ancestry, citizenship status, color, disability,
ethnicity, familial status, gender (including transgender), gender identity or expression,
genetic information, HIV/AIDs status, military status, national origin, pregnancy
(false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, childbirth, recovery therefrom or related
medical conditions, breastfeeding), race, religion (including religious dress and
grooming practices), sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other bases under
federal, state, local law, or regulations is prohibited.

The report, titled "Title IX Process Review for Select Cases," was issued to the Board
While the work of the Audit and Advisory Services team found university policies and
procedures met the appropriate national standards and requirements that govern the
universityï¿½s work in this area, the Task Force recognizes those standards create a
threshold of compliance, and believes that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve
upon processes for continuous review and strengthening of systems that balance and

point to several such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution

The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Forceï¿½s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Forceï¿½s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
Finally, the work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university
communityï¿½s response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report

The Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive
Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Action item No. 3, from the presidentï¿½s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the presidentï¿½s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,
policies, training, communications, historic activity, capacity and effectiveness.
At the conclusion of the review period, the team will recommend to the president and
the cabinet sustainable long-term approaches, action steps, structure and funding
requirements intended to improve the institutionï¿½s ability to prevent and respond
to sexual misconduct. The review will include but not be limited to recommendations

The Title IX Task Force was charged by former President Caslen to critically evaluate
the institutionï¿½s effectiveness in addressing sexual harassment and violence (SHV)
and to offer recommendations to enhance the institutionï¿½s effectiveness in addressing
Guided by principles of respect, accountability, and empowerment, the Task Force believes
that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve processes to support the needs of
both complainants and respondents. While the Task Forceï¿½s findings point to several
such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the
diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community safe each day.

“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
Title IX of theEducation Amendments of 1972
What You Should Know About Title IX
Title IX is a federal law and applies to educational institutions that receive federal funding. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs or activities, and protects all students, faculty, staff and visitors from sex-based discrimination. Some examples of education programs and activities subject to Title IX include admissions, academic instruction, residence life, athletics, extracurricular activities, employment, hiring, and other on-campus or off-campus activities organized or sponsored by an institution. The regulations implementing Title IX require educational institutions to follow a strict process when responding to reports or complaints of sex discrimination, and provide support for parties involved in the process, including autonomy for a complainant when deciding how to proceed.
There are many forms of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Title IX also prohibits discrimination based on an individual’s sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as pregnancy and parenting, childbirth and related medical conditions. Title IX prohibits retaliation against an individual who asserts any right or privilege under Title IX, or because the individual has made a report or Title IX complaint, or participated or refused to participate in the Title IX process.
As a recipient of federal funding, USC Upstate is required by Title IX regulations to operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. USC Upstate is committed to providing an environment for working, learning and living that promotes equal opportunity, inclusiveness and nondiscrimination, where students, faculty, staff and visitors are protected from all forms of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct (sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, stalking), and related retaliation.

Connect complainants and respondents to supportive measures and resources;
Review the options available at the university when making a report or Title IX complaint;
Advise complainants and respondents of their rights and resources;
