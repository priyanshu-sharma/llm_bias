A message from Dr. Roger J. Ward, the University's Chief Accountability Officer
Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
Thank you for helping to make our campus a harassment-free environment.

A message from Dr. Roger J. Ward, the University's Chief Accountability Officer
Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
Thank you for helping to make our campus a harassment-free environment.

CAO Letter - Updates to Title IX Regulations
To the UMB Community:On May 13, 2020, I communicated that the U.S. Department of Education had issued final amended regulations (the "Final Rule") regarding Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.In response to the Final Rule, the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) has released its Policy on Sexual Misconduct (VI-1.60(A)), which replaces the previous Policy Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct and Sex and Gender-Based Discrimination. This policy addresses the new requirements for defining and responding to reports of sexual misconduct. These changes are significant and, in some cases, require live hearings as part of the formal response.
In addition to the policy, UMB has issued two procedures that provide detailed expectations for the processes that will be used to respond to sexual misconduct:
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ("Title IX Procedures")
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ("Non-Title IX Procedures")
This policy and the procedures can be accessed from the UMB Policies and Procedures Library located here.
UMB's Office of Accountability and Compliance is operating remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, and our Title IX staff remains committed to providing information, resources, and assistance to our community. If you have questions, staff members are available via email at titleixcompliance@umaryland.edu or by telephone at 410-706-2281.
As always, if you have experienced, witnessed, or suspect someone has violated UMB's Policy on Sexual Misconduct, please do one of the following:
Report it by calling 866-594-5220.
Contact Stephanie Suerth, UMB’s Acting Title IX Coordinator, 410-706-5212, ssuerth@umaryland.edu or Marc Ware, UMB’s Deputy Title IX Coordinator, 410-706-1852, mware@umaryland.edu .
The University has worked diligently to respond to the changes in the requirements while affirming our commitment to an environment that is free from sex and gender-based discrimination.

Letter Regarding Updates to Title IX Regulations
To the UMB Community:The U.S. Department of Education recently announced final amended regulations regarding Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance.The new regulations are complex and require thoughtful examination and evaluation as the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) identifies the policy and operational responses needed to respond and remain compliant with the law. UMB is committed to continuing to provide a supportive University community and an environment that is free from sex- and gender-based discrimination.
We recognize that the new regulations may raise questions or concerns, so we invite the UMB community to contact our Title IX staff via email or by calling 410-706-2281.
UMB's Office of Accountability and Compliance is operating during the COVID-19 pandemic, and our Title IX staff remains committed to providing information, resources, and assistance to our community.
If you have experienced, witnessed, or suspect someone has violated Title IX, please do one of the following:
Report it by calling 866-594-5220.
Contact Title IX coordinator Mary MacFadden at 410-706-4938.

UMB is committed to a working and learning environment that is free from sex and gender-based discrimination.
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex or gender, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, as well as retaliation for reporting Title IX-prohibited behaviors or participating in Title IX processes. Through our policies and procedures, UMB not only fulfills its regulatory requirements, it also communicates the expectations UMB has for our community, the actions required, or requested, of our community if they experience or observe sexual misconduct, and the actions our community can expect from UMB when it receives reports of sexual misconduct.
The current UMB policies and procedures regarding prohibited sex discrimination are:
UMB Notice of Non-Discrimination [VI-1.00(C)]
UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct  [VI-1.60(A)]
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 “Title IX Procedures”
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 “Non-Title IX Procedures”
UMB Student Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures [VI-1.05(B)]
UMB Employee Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures [VI-1.05(A)]
UMB Policy Concerning Consensual Relationships  [VII-2.10(B)]
Under the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct, all UMB employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct that they regard as a violation of the policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority. Reports made through UMB’s Hotline are considered to be made to the Title IX Coordinator. UMB encourages students to report any experienced, witnessed, or suspected violations of the policy.
Reports of Sexual Misconduct may be made to UMB using any of the following options:
1. Report by phone, email, or U.S. mail to the Title IX Coordinator:

The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that sex offenses reportable under the Clery Act (20 U.S.C. §1092(f)) are reported in a timely manner to the UMB Police Department. An optional form for making the report can be found on the UMB Police website. Data collected for Clery Act reporting is to be used to increase public safety, not to identify the victim; therefore, personal identifying information is not required.

UMB is committed to a working and learning environment that is free from sex and gender-based discrimination.
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex or gender, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, as well as retaliation for reporting Title IX-prohibited behaviors or participating in Title IX processes. Through our policies and procedures, UMB not only fulfills its regulatory requirements, it also communicates the expectations UMB has for our community, the actions required, or requested, of our community if they experience or observe sexual misconduct, and the actions our community can expect from UMB when it receives reports of sexual misconduct.
The current UMB policies and procedures regarding prohibited sex discrimination are:
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 “Title IX Procedures”
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 “Non-Title IX Procedures”
UMB Student Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures [VI-1.05(B)]
UMB Employee Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures [VI-1.05(A)]
UMB Policy Concerning Consensual Relationships  [VII-2.10(B)]
Under the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct, all UMB employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct that they regard as a violation of the policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority. Reports made through UMB’s Hotline are considered to be made to the Title IX Coordinator. UMB encourages students to report any experienced, witnessed, or suspected violations of the policy.
Reports of Sexual Misconduct may be made to UMB using any of the following options:
1. Report by phone, email, or U.S. mail to the Title IX Coordinator:

Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.

UMB-Sponsored Educational Activities Involving Minors Procedures
Approved by the President March 30, 2015, replaced V1-1.30(A), to comply with USM V1-1.60 (eff. June 27, 2014, revised June 19, 2015); Revised August 26, 2015; Revised August 14, 2020; Revised March 24, 2023 to update links.
University of Maryland, Baltimore (“UMB” or “Institution”) is committed to providing a learning and working environment free from Sexual Misconduct, as defined in Section III of this Policy.  UMB prohibits and will not tolerate Sexual Misconduct. Sexual Misconduct is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by state and federal laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 as amended (“Title IX”) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and some forms of Sexual Misconduct may constitute criminal activity. UMB endeavors to foster a climate free from Sexual Misconduct through training, education, prevention programs, and policies and procedures that promote prompt reporting, prohibit retaliation, and promote timely, fair, and impartial investigation and resolution of Sexual Misconduct cases in a manner that eliminates the Sexual Misconduct, prevents its reoccurrence, and addresses its effects.
All students, faculty, and staff, as well as third parties and contractors under UMB control, are subject to this Policy regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This Policy applies to Sexual Misconduct in connection with any UMB educational program or activity, including Sexual Misconduct (1) in any UMB facility or on any UMB property; (2) in connection with any UMB sponsored, recognized or approved program, visit, or activity, regardless of location and inclusive of the online environment; (3) that impedes equal access to any UMB educational program or activity or adversely effects the employment of a member of the UMB community; or (4) that otherwise threatens the health or safety of a member of the UMB community. Nothing in this Policy is intended to supersede or conflict with any federal compliance obligation.
Federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) require that UMB implement certain procedures when UMB obtains Actual Knowledge of Sexual Harassment in its Education Programs or Activities against a person in the United States. UMB will address all allegations to determine whether the conduct occurred in the context of its employment or educational program or activity and/or has continuing effects on the campus or in an off-campus UMB program or activity, violating UMB policy. Prohibited Sexual Misconduct that violates UMB policy that does not fall under the scope of Title IX either because it occurs outside the United States or because it does not fall within Title IX’s definition of Sexual Harassment will be addressed using alternate processes as more fully described in UMB’s procedures.
If the Respondent is unknown or is not a member of the UMB community, the Title IX Coordinator will assist the Complainant (and the reporting party if someone other than the alleged victim has reported the Sexual Misconduct) in identifying appropriate campus and local resources and support options. UMB may take other actions as appropriate, such as barring a third party from UMB property and/or events. When the Respondent is enrolled in or employed by another USM institution, the Title IX Coordinator can assist in liaising with the appropriate individual for that institution and, in some instances, may make a report to the institution, as the alleged conduct may be prohibited by that school’s policies. Similarly, the Title IX Coordinator may be able to provide support to a student or employee who reports discrimination in an externship, study abroad program, or other environment external to UMB.
In Maryland, a person under the age of 16 years cannot consent to sexual activity. This means that sexual contact by an individual over the age of 18 with a person younger than 16 years old may be a crime, could require an immediate report to the applicable child welfare agency and/or local law enforcement agency, and represents a potential violation of this Policy, even if the minor appeared to welcome the sexual activity. See UMB’s Procedures for Reporting Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect (VI-1.50(A)) for mandatory requirements for Sexual Misconduct that includes a minor.
This Policy is not meant to inhibit or prohibit educational content or discussions inside or outside of the classroom that include controversial or sensitive subject matters protected by academic freedom.
UMB encourages those who are unsure whether a situation is controlled by this Policy to ask questions and seek advice through the Title IX Office or the Consultation Line, available at https://www.umaryland.edu/oac/consult-with-us/.
UMB will have actual knowledge that a violation of this Policy may have occurred when notice of the alleged violation is given to an Official with Authority to take corrective action. A report to the Title IX Coordinator or designee or received through UMB’s Hotline is sufficient to provide UMB with actual knowledge.
Advisor means a person chosen by a party or appointed by the institution to accompany the party to meetings related to the resolution process, to advise the party on that process, and to conduct cross-examination for the party at the hearing, if any.
An individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that is in violation of this Policy.
Employees of UMB who, in relation to the services being provided on behalf of the institution, have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential. A list of these individuals is listed in Section VI.C.4.
A knowing, voluntary, and affirmatively communicated willingness to mutually participate in a particular sexual activity or behavior.  Consent must be given by a person with the ability and capacity to exercise free will and make a rational and reasonable judgment. Consent may be expressed either by affirmative words or actions, as long as those words or actions create a mutually understandable permission regarding the conditions of sexual activity. Consent may be withdrawn at any time. Consent cannot be obtained by force, threat, coercion, fraud, manipulation, reasonable fear of injury, intimidation, or by using one’s mental or physical helplessness or incapacity. Consent cannot be implied based on the mere fact of a previous consensual dating or sexual relationship. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another.
If a person is incapacitated, which is to be deprived of their capacity or natural power, they are not able to make rational decisions and, therefore, cannot consent to sexual activity. Incapacity will be evaluated using a reasonable person standard, e.g., would a reasonable person believe the person is/was unable to consent.  Incapacitation can be caused by the consumption of alcohol, but a person who is “drunk” or intoxicated” may or may not be incapacitated; incapacitation can also be the result of being drugged, unconscious, sleep-deprived and/or ill.
Violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the Complainant’s statement, with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
A felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred; or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Maryland or the jurisdiction in which the crime or violence occurred.
Includes locations, events, or circumstances over which UMB has or does exercise substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by UMB.
Removal of a party from UMB’s program or activity on an emergency basis, provided UMB has undertaken an individualized safety and risk analysis, determined that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual harassment justifies removal, and provided the respondent with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.
A document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment by a Respondent and requesting that UMB investigate the allegation of sexual harassment. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator.
Decision-maker refers to the individual(s) who have decision-making and sanctioning authority within UMB’s formal grievance process.
Individuals who serve on hearing panels within UMB’s formal grievance process.
Investigator means the person or persons charged by UMB with gathering facts about an alleged violation of this Policy, synthesizing the evidence, and compiling this information into an investigation report.
Employees of UMB who do not have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential as listed in Section VI.C.4.
Any official of UMB with authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the institution.
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature by a person having power or authority over another and submission to such sexual conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual’s work or educational development or performance, or evaluation thereof.
A person who has been accused of violating this Policy.
Intimidating, threatening, coercing, or discriminating against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, USM or UMB policy relating to Sexual Misconduct, or because an individual has made a report, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to Sexual Misconduct. Retaliation includes retaliatory harassment.
The unfair, unfavorable, or inequitable treatment of a person based on their biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation.
An offense classified as a forcible or nonforcible sex offense, which as of 2018 have been combined in the single category “sex offenses,” under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is defined as:

The use of unreasonable pressure to compel another individual to initiate or continue sexual activity against the individual’s will. A person’s words or conduct are sufficient to constitute coercion if they wrongfully impair another individual’s freedom of will and ability to choose whether to engage in sexual activity. Coercion includes but is not limited to intimidation, manipulation, threats of emotional or physical harm, and blackmail. Examples of coercion include threatening to disclose another individual’s private sexual information, or threatening to harm oneself if the other party does not engage in the sexual activity.

Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the Complainant or the Respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipient’s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment.
UMB’s Title IX Coordinator oversees and coordinates UMB’s compliance with all aspects of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, all associated regulations promulgated under Title IX, and this Policy. The Title IX Coordinator is housed in the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC):
Stephanie Suerty, MPA, CCEPActing Title IX CoordinatorDirector, Special Projects Office of Accountability & Compliance 410-706-5212 titleixcompliance@umaryland.edu
The Title IX Coordinator acts to ensure that all UMB representatives involved in the investigation, resolution, and disciplinary processes act with objectivity and impartiality. Where the Title IX Coordinator determines that a UMB representative poses a conflict of interest or bias, the Title IX Coordinator shall recuse that person(s) from the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes. Concerns of bias or a potential conflict of interest by any other administrator involved in the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes should be raised with the Title IX Coordinator.
The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for receiving complaints or reports of conduct that could constitute sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managing the Title IX Program, including the informal and formal grievance processes, and ensuring effective implementation of any remedies determined through UMB’s grievance process.
Reports of misconduct or discrimination committed by the Title IX Coordinator, or concerns regarding potential bias or conflict of interest by the Title IX Coordinator, should be made to UMB’s Chief Accountability Officer and Vice President, Dr. Susan Buskirk; or through the UMB Hotline.
A. Prohibitions Against Sex and Gender-based Discrimination
UMB adheres to all federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination in public institutions of higher education. Specifically, Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in UMB programs and activities.
UMB does not discriminate, or tolerate discrimination, against any employee, applicant for employment, student, or applicant for admission on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.  Sex and Gender-based Discrimination is prohibited.
This Policy includes Sex and Gender-based Discrimination in both employment and access to educational opportunities, and access to services and programs provided by UMB.  Therefore, any member of the UMB community who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational or employment access and/or opportunities of any member of the UMB community, guest, or visitor on the basis of sex or gender in violation of federal and state laws and regulations is in violation of this Policy. UMB's prohibitions on discrimination extend to its admissions and hiring processes. UMB will take steps to eliminate prohibited conduct, prevent its reoccurrence, and remedy its effects.
UMB does not tolerate Sexual Misconduct of or by any employee, affiliate, volunteer, student, visitor, contractor, or guest. UMB will act to remedy all forms of Sexual Misconduct.
UMB reserves the right to address offensive conduct and/or harassment not prohibited by this Policy, for example, harassment that does not rise to the level of creating a hostile environment, or is of a generic nature not based on sex or gender. Such conduct may be referred for alternative review and resolution by the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC) to other departments as appropriate, including to Human Resources Services (HRS) for human resource related violations and to Deans or their designees for student code of conduct violations.
Any person may report Sexual Harassment (whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment).
All UMB Non-Confidential Employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct which they believe may be a violation of this Policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority.  Failure of a Non-Confidential Employee to report an incident or incidents of Sexual Misconduct of which they become aware is a violation of this Policy and the violator could be subject to disciplinary action.
No employee (other than UMB Police) is authorized to investigate or resolve reports of prohibited conduct without the involvement of the Title IX Coordinator.
All UMB students are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.
Third Parties (e.g., contractors, visitors, etc.) are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.
1. UMB is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of information of all individuals involved in a Sexual Misconduct matter.  Privacy and confidentiality have distinct meanings under this Policy.
Privacy generally means that information related to a report of Sexual Misconduct will be shared only with those UMB employees with a “need to know” the information in order to assist in the review, investigation, or resolution of the report.  Although not bound by confidentiality, these employees will make every effort to protect the privacy interests of all individuals, consistent with due process requirements and the need for a thorough review.
Confidentiality means that the information shared with professionals who have been designated by UMB as confidential resources cannot be revealed to any other person without the express permission of the individual who shared the information with the professional.  These designated professionals are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.
An individual who wishes to discuss a Sexual Misconduct matter confidentially may do so by speaking with a professional who has a legal duty to maintain confidentiality.  Confidential resources for UMB students and employees are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.  Information shared with these resources will not be shared with anyone without the individual’s express permission, unless maintaining such confidentiality would result in imminent physical harm to the individual or other individuals.  When a report involves suspected abuse of a minor, applicable laws and UMB policies require reporting to child protective services and/or local law enforcement.
If a Complainant or other reporting party does want their name to be shared, does not want an investigation to take place, or does not want a formal resolution to be pursued, they may make such a request to the Title IX Coordinator, who will evaluate the request along with various considerations, including risks to members of the UMB community and legal requirements. UMB will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with a request for privacy or a request not to pursue an investigation.  Where UMB is unable to take action consistent with the request of the Complainant or reporting party, the Title IX Coordinator will inform them about UMB’s chosen course of action.
If a report of Sexual Misconduct discloses a serious or continuing threat to the UMB community, UMB may issue a campus-wide timely warning to protect the health or safety of the UMB community. The timely warning will not include identifying information about the reporting party.
Reports of Sexual Misconduct may be made to UMB using any of the following options:
1. Report by phone, e-mail or U.S. mail, directly to the Title IX Coordinator:

Mercy Medical Center is the designated treatment center for sexual assault and domestic violence in Baltimore City where victims of sexual assault (aged 13 and older) may obtain a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE), including Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits.   A police report is not required in order to obtain an exam, which can be conducted up to five (5) days after an assault. Medical attention is recommended even if more than five (5) days have passed since the assault occurred.
Mercy Medical Center Emergency Room345 St. Paul PlaceBaltimore, Maryland 21202410-332-9494https://bmoresafemercy.org/for-patients/
UMB Title IX personnel are available to promptly assist anyone experiencing sex- or gender-based violence, including sexual assault, in obtaining medical attention, including providing transportation to the nearest designated SAFE hospital.
Information on Maryland SAFE programs located outside Baltimore City is included in Section XIV. Resources, below.
UMB encourages the reporting of Sexual Misconduct by victims and witnesses.  Sometimes, victims or witnesses are hesitant to report misconduct or participate in resolution processes because they fear that they themselves may be accused of policy violations.  It is in the best interest of the UMB community for victims and witnesses to report misconduct.  To encourage reporting, UMB offers amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.
If the behavior was a violation of the drug or alcohol policy, and UMB is not required by law to intervene or report, UMB will offer amnesty if the violation occurred reasonably during or near the time of the alleged Sexual Misconduct, the person reported or is cooperating with UMB’s investigation in good faith, and the behavior did not put another individual’s health or safety at risk.
UMB encourages community members to assist victims during or after an incident when it is safe to do so, and offers training in bystander intervention.  For students who offer help to others in need, UMB pursues a policy of amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.
Upon receipt by the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority of an allegation or notice of an alleged violation of the Policy, UMB initiates its resolution process, which involves a prompt preliminary review to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe this Policy has been violated.
The Title IX Coordinator will initiate communication with the Complainant to offer Supportive Measures and determine if the Complainant wishes to file a Formal Complaint.  Upon receipt of a Formal Complaint, the parties will be provided with written notice of the allegations, UMB’s grievance process, including formal and informal resolution processes, the right of an Advisor of the party’s choice, and UMB’s policies regarding knowingly making false statements or submitting false information.
UMB will investigate allegations in a Formal Complaint.  Any allegations that do not constitute an allegation of Sexual Harassment as defined in Section III.W, did not occur in UMB’s education program or activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, will be dismissed for purposes of a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment under Title IX; such a dismissal does not preclude UMB from taking action under this Policy, UMB’s Code of Ethics and Conduct or other relevant policies.
UMB’s investigatory process assumes the responsibility to ensure that the burden of proof and the burden of gathering sufficient evidence to reach a determination is borne by UMB. During the investigation process, the parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses, including fact and expert witness, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.  Neither party will be restricted from discussing the allegations or gathering and presenting relevant evidence.
To the extent allegations fall within the scope of Title IX, at the conclusion of the investigation, adjudication of the allegations will occur through a live hearing.  During the hearing, as more fully described in the Procedures, each party, through their Advisor, will have the opportunity to question and cross-examine the other party and any witnesses.  Live hearings may be conducted with the parties located in separate rooms/locations with technology enabling the decision-maker(s), panelists, and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. For parties that do not have an advisor, UMB will provide an Advisor of its choice, who may or may not be an attorney, for the purposes of conducting such questioning and cross-examination. An audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of the live hearing will be made available to the parties for inspection and review.  A Determination will be made by the Decision-maker and a written Determination report will be provided to the parties simultaneously.
To the extent allegations fall partially within the scope of Title IX and partially within the scope of other policies, UMB may bifurcate matters.
The parties may appeal a Determination, or any dismissal of a Formal Complaint, on the following grounds:
Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;
New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal of the Formal Complaint was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; and
The Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.
In order to make a determination of whether or not a policy violation occurred, UMB uses the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, that is, whether it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred.
The investigation and subsequent resolution processes determine whether the Policy has been violated. If it is determined that a policy violation occurred, UMB will promptly implement effective remedies designed to end the discrimination, prevent its reoccurrence, and address its effects.
Upon the freely given consent of both parties, an informal resolution process may be chosen in lieu of the formal process of investigation and adjudication.  For those parties that agree to an Informal Process, UMB will provide a written notice of the allegation, the requirements for participation in the Informal Resolution process, the right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution process at any time before a resolution is agreed upon, and the potential consequences that may result from participating in the Informal Resolution process. Where there is an allegation of Sexual Misconduct committed by an employee against a student, the Informal Resolution process will not be offered as an option.
UMB prohibits the use of mediation to resolve policy violations where the Sexual Misconduct includes stalking, sexual assault, or sexual coercion.
Complainants and Respondents may have an advisor of their choice attend with them all meetings and interviews within the resolution process, if they so choose.
Where a matter falls within the scope of Title IX such that a live hearing is required, Complainants and Respondents must have an advisor when a formal process is initiated and these advisors will be responsible for questioning witnesses during the live hearing of the grievance process. Each party may select whomever they wish for this role if the person(s) is eligible and available, i.e., is not a party or witness in the process and is not a minor. Examples of advisors include a licensed attorney, an advocate who is supervised by a licensed attorney, or a trained advocate. In addition, as necessary, a translator will be made available upon request of a party.
The advisor may attend meetings or interviews with the party.  The advisor must attend any hearings and will be required to conduct any cross-examination on behalf of the party they are advising.  The advisor may offer private consultations with the party during hearings, meetings, and interviews, except during questioning of the party.  Parties may request, through the Title IX Coordinator, to have more than one Advisor.  The decision to grant this request is at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and will be granted equitably to all parties.
A current or former UMB student who makes a complaint or who responds to a complaint on which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and who was enrolled as a student at UMB at the time of the incident that is the basis of the complaint may obtain legal counsel through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (the “Commission”). The Commission has developed a list of attorneys and legal services programs willing to represent students on a pro bono basis or at reduced fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. The student may select an attorney on the Commission’s list or seek an alternate attorney to whom the Commission will pay reasonable fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs.  Any fees above and beyond those paid under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation are the responsibility of the student. The Commission will not pay attorney’s fees for representation of a student in any criminal or civil matter or any administrative matter that is not a Title IX proceeding at an institution operating in Maryland. See https://mhec.maryland.gov/Pages/Title-IX-Campus-Sexual-Assault-Proceedings.aspx.
UMB will make a good faith effort to complete the resolution process, including any appeal, within a sixty (60) calendar day time period, which can be extended as necessary by the Title IX Coordinator, with notice to the parties.
UMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to weeks) and resolution process if circumstances require. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the need for language assistance, the absence of parties and/or witnesses, and/or accommodation for disabilities or health conditions. UMB will communicate in writing the anticipated duration of the delay and reason to the parties and provide the parties with status updates if necessary. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process as soon as feasible. During such a delay, UMB will implement Supportive Measures as deemed appropriate. Institutional action(s) are not precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.
C. Withdrawal or Resignation During Resolution Process
Students: Should a student decide not to participate in the process, the process will proceed to an appropriate resolution.
Should a student Respondent permanently withdraw from the Institution, the process will end, as the Institution no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former student. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that have contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct. The student who withdraws or leaves while the process is pending may not return to UMB and a hold will be placed on their ability to be readmitted. If the student withdraws or takes leave for a specified period of time (e.g., one semester or term), the process will continue and that student will not be permitted to return to UMB unless and until the process is concluded and, where applicable, any sanctions have been satisfied. During the process, UMB may put a hold on a Respondent’s transcript or place a note on a Respondent’s transcript or dean’s disciplinary certification that a disciplinary matter is pending.
Employees: Should an employee Respondent resign from employment with unresolved allegations pending, the resolution process ends, as UMB no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former employee. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct.
Individuals involved in reported Sexual Misconduct may be entitled to Supportive Measures.  In some instances, Supportive Measures such as no-contact orders, may extend beyond the conclusion of informal or formal resolution of a complaint.  Supportive Measures are not sanctions.
Supportive Measures, may include, but are not limited to, the following:
notification of the appropriate administrative authorities regarding possible absences from employment or academic program
extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments
arrangements for alternative academic, living, or employment situations, if such alternative is available and feasible
modifications to work or class schedules, building access points, parking lot assignments, and other similar logistics, including increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus
development of a mutual no-contact order (or a no-trespass order against a non-affiliated third party)
Any request(s) for Supportive Measures should be made to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact the appropriate UMB personnel to coordinate and implement Supportive Measures.
Sanctions may be imposed upon any member of the UMB community determined to have violated this Policy. The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:
UMB considers Sexual Assault to be the most serious sexual misconduct.  Respondents found responsible for Sexual Assault violations typically receive the most severe sanctions, including suspension or dismissal for students and termination for employees. However, UMB reserves the right to impose any level of sanction, ranging from a reprimand up to and including suspension or expulsion/termination, for any act of Sexual Misconduct, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
The Hearing Decision-maker or Panel reserves the right to deviate from the range of recommended sanctions in the case of serious mitigating circumstances or egregiously offensive conduct. Neither the initial hearing officers nor any appeals body or officer will deviate from the range of recommended sanctions unless compelling justification exists to do so.
Respondents are expected to comply with all assigned sanctions, responsive actions, and corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the Decision-maker and/or Title IX Coordinator. Failure to abide by the sanctions/actions imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanctions/actions, including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination, and may be noted on a student’s official transcript or in an employee’s official record. A suspension will be lifted only after compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.
Retaliation is any adverse action taken because of a person’s participation in a protected activity. Protected activities include reporting an incident that may implicate this Policy, participating in the resolution process (as a party or witness), supporting a reporting party, Complainant or Respondent, or assisting in providing information relevant to an investigation. Protected activities also include opposing Sexual Misconduct, refusing to participate in wrongful or unlawful activities or refusing to carry out a directive that would include engaging in or hiding wrongful or unlawful activities.   Adverse actions are negative professional or educational actions, that would not otherwise have been taken, to deter an individual from engaging in, or in retaliation against an individual for participating in, protected activities.  Adverse actions are actions that would dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in the complaint process (either as a party or non-party witness).
Acts of alleged retaliation should be reported immediately using the UMB Hotline and will be promptly investigated as a potential separate violation of this Policy. UMB is prepared to take appropriate steps to prevent retaliation.
Records of all allegations, investigations, formal and informal resolutions, and hearings will be kept for at least seven (7) years by the Title IX Coordinator. The Institution will also retain records of the training provided to Title IX Coordinators, investigators, and decision-makers.
Annually, UMB community members are expected to participate in training that addresses Title IX rights, responsibilities, and obligations, raises awareness regarding Sexual Misconduct, and seeks to prevent its occurrence. Information on mandatory training will be provided through the Title IX website.
Training for Students: UMB provides mandatory student training at the beginning of each academic year.
Training for Employees: UMB provides mandatory employee training upon hire and at the beginning of each academic year. Additional mandatory training may be required based on the employee’s role within UMB.
Additionally, University Recreation and Fitness (URecFit), in collaboration with University Police, offers Rape Aggression Defense Training (RAD) on techniques for prevention and defense.
Requests for additional training can be made through the Office of Accountability and Compliance, at www.umaryland.edu/oac.

UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 "Title IX Procedures"
To describe how UMB will act on any formal or informal notice/complaint of violation of the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct (“the Policy”) that is received by the Title IX Coordinator or any other Official with Authority by applying these procedures, known as “Title IX Procedures”.
The procedures below apply only to Qualifying Allegations of sexual harassment that are subject to the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX) (including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking) involving students, staff, administrator, or faculty members.
UMB will act on any formal or informal notice/complaint of violation of the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct (“the Policy”) that is received by the Title IX Coordinator or any other Official with Authority by applying these procedures, known as “Title IX Procedures”.
The procedures below apply only to Qualifying Allegations of sexual harassment that are subject to the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX) (including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking) involving students, staff, administrator, or faculty members.
Allegations of Prohibited Sexual Misconduct that violate the Policy that do not fall under the scope of Title IX are not Qualifying Allegations and will be resolved following UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Non-Title IX Procedures).  The UMB Title IX Coordinator is responsible for determining if an allegation is a Qualifying Allegation.   An allegation pertaining to Sexual Misconduct that occurred outside the United States and an allegation pertaining to Sexual Misconduct that does not satisfy the definition of Sexual Harassment under Title IX are not Qualifying Allegations.
The procedures below may be used to resolve non-sexual misconduct violations of UMB policy if the collateral misconduct arises from the investigation of or occurring in conjunction with the alleged discriminatory sexual conduct. Other allegations of misconduct, unrelated to sexual misconduct allegations covered by the UMB Policy will be addressed through other appropriate UMB procedures.  This procedure incorporates by reference the definitions in the UMB Policy.
Upon the Title IX Coordinator’s receipt of a complaint or notice alleging violation of the UMB Policy, the Title IX Coordinator will initiate a prompt Initial Assessment to determine the next steps UMB will take.
If a Complainant does not wish to disclose their personally identifiable information (i.e. wishes to remain anonymous) and/or does not wish to proceed, the Complainant may make such a request to the Title IX Coordinator. Regardless of their choice, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will offer Supportive Measures to the Complainant as appropriate.
Following receipt of notice or a complaint of an alleged violation of the Policy, the Title IX Coordinator engages in an initial assessment, typically within one to five business days. The steps in an initial assessment can include:
If notice is given, the Title IX Coordinator seeks to determine if the person impacted wishes to make a Formal Complaint, and will assist them to do so, if desired.
If they do not wish to do so, the Title IX Coordinator determines whether to initiate a complaint because a violence risk assessment indicates a compelling threat to health and/or safety.
If a Formal Complaint is received, the Title IX Coordinator assesses its sufficiency and works with the Complainant to make sure it is correctly completed.
The Title IX Coordinator reaches out to the Complainant to offer supportive measures.
The Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to ensure they are aware of the right to have an Advisor.
The Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to determine whether the Complainant prefers a supportive and remedial response, an informal resolution option, or a formal investigation and grievance process.
If a supportive and remedial response is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to identify their wishes, assesses the request, and implements accordingly. No Formal Grievance Process is initiated, though the Complainant can elect to initiate one later, if desired.
If an informal resolution option is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator assesses whether the complaint is suitable for informal resolution, and may seek to determine if the Respondent is also willing to engage in informal resolution. Either party may terminate the informal resolution process and proceed through the formal grievance process at any time up until an agreement is entered.
If a Formal Grievance Process is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator determines if the misconduct alleged falls within the scope of Title IX,
The alleged conduct would constitute Sexual Harassment within an Education Program or Activity against a person in the United States if substantiated; and
The Complainant is participating or attempting to participate in an Education Program or Activity, including the admissions or hiring process, at the time the Complainant files a Formal Complaint.
If it does, the Title IX Coordinator will initiate the formal investigation and grievance process under the Title IX Procedures, directing the investigation to address:
a culture/climate issue, based on the nature of the complaint.
If it does not, the Title IX Coordinator determines that Title IX does not apply (and will “dismiss” that aspect of the complaint, if any), assesses which policies may apply and refers the matter for resolution under Non-Title IX Procedures or other relevant resolution process.
Please note that dismissing a complaint under Title IX is solely a procedural requirement under Title IX, and does not limit UMB’s authority to address a complaint with an appropriate process and remedies.
At the discretion of the Title IX Officer or designee, multiple reports may be consolidated into one Informal Resolution and/or investigation if the information related to each incident is relevant in reaching a resolution. Matters may be consolidated where the matters involve multiple Complainants, multiple Respondents, or related facts and circumstances involving the same Parties, including those arising out of the same or different events(s).
In many cases, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that a Violence Risk Assessment (VRA) should be conducted by the UMB Behavioral Awareness and Threat Assessment (BETA) team as part of the initial assessment. A VRA can aid in ten critical and/or required determinations, including:
Emergency removal of a Respondent on the basis of immediate threat to physical health/safety;
Whether the Title IX Coordinator should pursue/sign a Formal Complaint absent a willing/able Complainant;
Whether to put the investigation on the footing of incident and/or pattern and/or climate;
Whether it is reasonable to try to resolve a complaint through Informal Resolution, and what modality may be most successful;
Whether to permit a voluntary withdrawal by the Respondent;
Whether to impose transcript notation or communicate with a transfer about a Respondent;
Assessment of appropriate sanctions/remedies (to be applied post-hearing); and/or
Whether a Clery Act Timely Warning/Trespass order/Persona-non-grata is needed.
Threat assessment is the process of evaluating the actionability of violence by an individual against another person or group following the issuance of a direct or conditional threat. A VRA is a broader term used to assess any potential violence or danger, regardless of the presence of a vague, conditional, or direct threat.
A VRA authorized by the Title IX Coordinator should occur in collaboration with the UMB BETA team. Where a VRA is required by the Title IX Coordinator, a Respondent refusing to cooperate may result in a charge of failure to comply within the appropriate student or employee conduct process.
A VRA is not an evaluation for an involuntary behavioral health hospitalization (e.g., 5150 in California, Section XII in Massachusetts, Baker Act in Florida), nor is it a psychological or mental health assessment. A VRA assesses the risk of actionable violence, often with a focus on targeted/predatory escalations, and is supported by research from the fields of law enforcement, criminology, human resources, and psychology.
UMB’s Policy XI-3.00(A) UMB Behavioral Evaluation and Threat Assessment Policy can be found here.
UMB must dismiss a Formal Complaint or any allegations therein if under the Title IX Procedures, at any time during the investigation or hearing, it is determined that:
1) The conduct alleged in the formal complaint would not constitute sexual harassment as defined in UMB’s Policy on Sexual Misconduct, even if proved; and/or
2) The conduct did not occur in an educational program or activity controlled by the UMB (including buildings or property controlled by recognized student organizations), and/or UMB does not have control of the Respondent; and/or
3) The conduct did not occur against a person in the United States; and/or
4) At the time of filing a formal complaint, a Complainant is not participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity of the UMB.
UMB may dismiss a formal complaint or any allegations therein if, at any time during the investigation or hearing:
1) A Complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the Complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein; or
2) The Respondent is no longer enrolled in or employed by UMB; or
3) Specific circumstances prevent UMB from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.
Upon any dismissal, UMB will promptly send written notice of the dismissal and the rationale for doing so simultaneously to the parties.  The written notice of dismissal will also include, if the Formal Complaint was dismissed due to falling outside the scope of Title IX, if the allegations will be addressed using Non-Title IX Procedures.  For complaints that will addressed using Non-Title IX Procedures, Alleged Violations of the Policy on Sexual Misconduct: Non-Title IX Procedures (“Non-Title IX Procedures”).
This dismissal decision is appealable by any party under the procedures for appeal below.  A Complainant who decides to withdraw a complaint may later request to reinstate it or refile it.
UMB is obligated to ensure that the grievance process is not abused for retaliatory purposes. UMB permits the filing of counterclaims but uses an initial assessment, described above, to assess whether the allegations in the counterclaim are made in good faith. Counterclaims by a Respondent may be made in good faith, but are, on occasion, made for purposes of retaliation, instead. Counterclaims made with retaliatory intent will not be permitted.
Counterclaims determined to have been reported in good faith will be processed using the grievance procedures below. Investigation of such claims may take place after resolution of the underlying initial allegation, in which case a delay may occur.
Counterclaims may also be resolved through the same investigation as the underlying allegation, at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator. When counterclaims are not made in good faith, they will be considered retaliatory and may constitute a violation of this policy.
The parties may each have an Advisor of their choice present with them for all meetings, interviews, and hearings within the resolution process, if they so choose. The parties may select whoever they wish to serve as their Advisor as long as the Advisor is eligible and available.
Choosing an Advisor who is also a witness in the process creates potential for bias and conflict-of-interest. A party who chooses an Advisor who is also a witness can anticipate that issues of potential bias will be explored by the hearing Decision-maker(s).
UMB may permit parties to have more than one Advisor upon request to the Title IX Coordinator. The decision to grant this request is at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and will be granted equitably to all parties.
As a public entity, UMB fully respects and accords the Weingarten rights of employees. For parties who are entitled to union representation, UMB will allow the unionized employee to have their union representative (if requested by the party) as well as an Advisor of their choice present for all resolution-related meetings and interviews. To uphold the principles of equity, the other party (regardless of union membership) will also be permitted to have two Advisors. Witnesses are not permitted to have union representation or Advisors in grievance process interviews or meetings.
The Advisor may be a friend, mentor, family member, attorney, or any other individual a party chooses to advise, support, and/or consult with them throughout the resolution process. The parties may choose Advisors from inside or outside of the UMB community.
The Title IX Coordinator will also offer to assign a trained Advisor for any party if the party so chooses. If the parties choose an Advisor from the pool available from UMB, the Advisor will be trained by UMB and be familiar with UMB’s resolution process.
If the parties choose an Advisor from outside the pool of those identified by UMB, the Advisor may not have been trained by UMB and may not be familiar with UMB policies and procedures.
Parties also have the right to choose not to have an Advisor in the initial stages of the resolution process, prior to a hearing.
Advisors may request to meet with the administrative officials conducting interviews/meetings in advance of these interviews or meetings. This pre-meeting allows Advisors to clarify and understand their role and UMB’s policies and procedures.
The parties may be accompanied by their Advisor in all meetings and interviews at which the party is entitled to be present, including intake and interviews. Advisors should help the parties prepare for each meeting and are expected to advise ethically, with integrity, and in good faith.
UMB cannot guarantee equal Advisory rights, meaning that if one party selects an Advisor who is an attorney, but the other party does not or cannot afford an attorney, UMB is not obligated to provide an attorney.
Under U.S. Department of Education regulations under Title IX, a form of indirect questioning is required during the hearing, but must be conducted by the parties’ Advisors. The parties are not permitted to directly question each other or any witnesses. If a party does not have an Advisor for a hearing, UMB will appoint a trained Advisor for the limited purpose of conducting any questioning of the other party and witnesses.
A party may reject this appointment and choose their own Advisor, but they may not proceed without an Advisor. If the party’s Advisor will not conduct questioning, UMB will appoint an Advisor who will do so thoroughly, regardless of the participation or non-participation of the advised party in the hearing itself. Extensive questioning of the parties and witnesses will also be conducted by the Decision-maker(s) during the hearing.
All Advisors are subject to the same UMB policies and procedures, whether they are attorneys or not. Advisors are expected to advise their advisees without disrupting proceedings. Advisors may not address UMB officials in a meeting or interview unless invited to (e.g., asking procedural questions). The Advisor may not make a presentation or represent their advisee during any meeting or proceeding and may not speak on behalf of the advisee to the Investigator(s) or other Decision-maker(s) except during a hearing proceeding, during cross-examination.
The parties are expected to ask and respond to questions on their own behalf throughout the investigation phase of the resolution process. Although the Advisor generally may not speak on behalf of their advisee, the Advisor may consult with their advisee, either privately as needed, or by conferring or passing notes during any resolution process meeting or interview. For longer or more involved discussions, the parties and their Advisors may ask for breaks to allow for private consultation.
Any Advisor who oversteps their role as defined by this policy will be warned only once. If the Advisor continues to disrupt or otherwise fails to respect the limits of the Advisor role, the meeting will be ended, or other appropriate measures implemented. Subsequently, the Title IX Coordinator will determine how to address the Advisor’s non-compliance and future role.
UMB expects that the parties may wish to have UMB share documentation and evidence related to the allegations with their Advisors. Parties may share this information directly with their Advisor or other individuals if they wish. Doing so may help the parties participate more meaningfully in the resolution process.
UMB provides a consent form that authorizes UMB to share such information directly with their Advisor. The parties must complete and submit this form to the Title IX Coordinator before UMB is able to share records with an Advisor.
If a party requests that all communication be made through their attorney Advisor, UMB will not comply with that request. It is the responsibility of the parties to provide information to their Advisor, including communications.
Advisors are expected to maintain the privacy of the records shared with them. These records may not be shared with third parties, disclosed publicly, or used for purposes not explicitly authorized by UMB. UMB may seek to restrict the role of any Advisor who does not respect the sensitive nature of the process or who fails to abide by UMB’s privacy expectations.
UMB generally expects an Advisor to adjust their schedule to allow them to attend meetings when planned, but may change scheduled meetings to accommodate an Advisor’s inability to attend, if doing so does not cause an unreasonable delay.
UMB may also make reasonable provisions to allow an Advisor who cannot attend in person to attend a meeting by telephone, video conferencing, or other similar technologies as may be convenient and available.
i. Expectations of the Parties with Respect to Advisors
A party may elect to change Advisors during the process and is not obligated to use the same Advisor throughout. The parties are expected to inform the Investigator(s) of the identity of their Advisor at least two (2) business days before the date of their first meeting with Investigators (or as soon as possible if a more expeditious meeting is necessary or desired).
The parties are expected to provide timely notice to the Title IX Coordinator if they change Advisors at any time. It is assumed that if a party changes Advisors, consent to share information with the previous Advisor is terminated, and a release for the new Advisor must be secured. Parties are expected to inform the Title IX Coordinator of the identity of their hearing Advisor at least two (2) business days before the hearing.
UMB provides an Advisor to either Party for the specific purpose of conducting cross-examination if the Party has not chosen an Advisor.  Advisors may be chosen from the UMB Community. UMB does not guarantee an Advisor will have legal knowledge or expertise.
For representation, Respondents may wish to contact organizations such as:
Complainants may wish to contact organizations such as:
The Victim Rights Law Center (http://www.victimrights.org)
The National Center for Victims of Crime (http://www.victimsofcrime.org), which maintains the Crime Victim’s Bar Association.
The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund: https://nwlc.org/times-up-legal-defense-fund/
k. Legal Representation Fund for Title IX Proceedings (Students Only)
A current or former UMB student who makes a complaint or who responds to a complaint on which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and who was enrolled as a student at UMB at the time of the incident that is the basis of the complaint may obtain legal counsel through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (the “Commission”). The Commission has developed a list of attorneys and legal services programs willing to represent students on a pro bono basis or at reduced fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. The student may select an attorney on the Commission’s list or seek an alternate attorney to whom the Commission will pay reasonable fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs.  Any fees above and beyond those paid under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation are the responsibility of the student. The Commission will not pay attorney’s fees for representation of a student in any criminal or civil matter or any administrative matter that is not a Title IX proceeding at an institution operating in Maryland. See https://mhec.maryland.gov/Pages/Title-IX-Campus-Sexual-Assault-Proceedings.aspx.
Resolution proceedings are private. All persons present at any time during the resolution process are expected to maintain the privacy of the proceedings in accordance with UMB’s policy. Although there is an expectation of privacy around what Investigators share with parties during interviews, the parties have discretion to share their own knowledge and evidence with others if they so choose, with the exception of information the parties agree not to disclose related to Informal Resolution, discussed below. UMB encourages parties to discuss any sharing of information with their Advisors before doing so.
Informal Resolution can include three different approaches:
When the Title IX Coordinator can resolve the matter informally by providing supportive measures (only) to remedy the situation.
When the parties agree to resolve the matter through an alternate resolution mechanism as described below, usually before a formal investigation takes place; see discussion in b., below.
When the Respondent accepts responsibility for violating policy, and desires to accept a sanction and end the resolution process (similar to above, but usually occurs post-investigation); see discussion in c., below.
To initiate Informal Resolution, a Complainant needs to submit a Formal Complaint.  A Respondent who wishes to initiate Informal Resolution should contact the Title IX Coordinator.
It is not necessary to pursue Informal Resolution first in order to pursue a Formal Grievance Process, and any party participating in Informal Resolution can stop the process at any time and begin or resume the Formal Grievance Process.
Prior to implementing Informal Resolution, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will provide the parties with written notice on behalf of UMB of the reported misconduct and any sanctions or measures that may result from participating in such a process, including information regarding any records that will be maintained or shared by UMB.
UMB will obtain voluntary, written confirmation that all parties wish to resolve the matter through Informal Resolution before proceeding and will not pressure the parties to participate in Informal Resolution. Upon conclusion of the Informal Resolution, the parties will be provided a written copy of the terms of resolution agreement.
Alternate Resolution is an informal mechanism by which the parties reach a mutually agreed upon resolution of an allegation. All parties must consent to the use of an Alternate Resolution n
The Title IX Coordinator may look to the following factors to assess whether Alternate Resolution is appropriate, or which form of Alternate Resolution may be most successful for the parties:
Likelihood of potential resolution, taking into account any power dynamics between the parties;
Results of a violence risk assessment/ongoing risk analysis;
Skill of the Alternate Resolution facilitator with this type of allegation;
Adequate resources to invest in Alternate Resolution (time, staff, etc.)
The ultimate determination of whether Alternate Resolution is available or successful is to be made by the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator maintains records of any resolution that is reached, and failure to abide by the resolution agreement may result in appropriate remedial/disciplinary actions. Results of complaints resolved by Informal Resolution or Alternate Resolution are not appealable.
c. Respondent Accepts Responsibility for Alleged Violations
The Respondent may accept responsibility for all or part of the alleged policy violations at any point during the resolution process. If the Respondent indicates an intent to accept responsibility for all of the alleged misconduct, the formal process will be paused, and the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether Informal Resolution can be used according to the criteria above.
If Informal Resolution is applicable, the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether all parties and UMB are able to agree on responsibility, sanctions, and/or remedies. If so, the Title IX Coordinator implements the accepted finding that the Respondent is in violation of UMB policy and implements agreed-upon sanctions and/or remedies, in coordination with other appropriate administrator(s), as necessary.
This result is not subject to appeal once all parties indicate their written assent to all agreed upon terms of resolution. When the parties cannot agree on all terms of resolution, the Formal Grievance Process will resume at the same point where it was paused.
When a resolution is accomplished, the appropriate sanction or remedial actions are promptly implemented in order to effectively stop the harassment or discrimination, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the effects of the discriminatory conduct, both on the Complainant and the community.
The Title IX Coordinator, with the consent of the parties, may negotiate and implement an agreement to resolve the allegations that satisfies all parties and UMB. Negotiated Resolutions are not appealable.
The Formal Grievance Process relies on a pool of administrators (“the Pool”) to carry out the process.
Members of the Pool are trained annually, and can serve in in the following roles, based on the training received and at the direction of the Title IX Coordinator:
To provide appropriate intake of and initial guidance pertaining to complaints
To serve in a facilitation role in Informal Resolution process
To serve as a hearing facilitator (process administrator, no decision-making role)
The Chief Accountability Officer, who may consult with the Title IX Coordinator or other relevant parties, appoints the Pool, which acts with independence and impartiality. Some members of the Pool may be trained in a variety of skill sets and can rotate amongst the different roles listed above in different cases.  Some members of the Pool will have permanent roles. This process of role assignment may be the result of particular training, skills, aptitudes, or talents identified that make them best suited to particular roles.
The Pool members receive annual training. Training will be specific to the roles the Pool member may hold and may include, but is not limited to:
The scope of the UMB’s Discrimination and Harassment Policy and Procedures
How to conduct investigations and hearings that protect the safety of Complainants and Respondents, and promote accountability
Applicable laws, regulations, and federal regulatory guidance
How to implement appropriate and situation-specific remedies
How to investigate in a thorough, reliable, and impartial manner
How to render findings and generate clear, concise, evidence-based rationales
How to apply definitions used by UMB with respect to consent (or the absence or negation of consent) consistently, impartially, and in accordance with policy
How to conduct an investigation and grievance process including hearings, appeals, and informal resolution processes
How to serve impartially by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias
Issues of relevance to create an investigation report that fairly summarizes relevant evidence
How to determine appropriate sanctions in reference to all forms of harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation allegations
Not all members of the Pool will receive training in skills applicable to roles they will not serve.
Specific training is also provided for Appeal Decision-makers, intake personnel, Advisors (who are UMB employees), and Chairs. All Pool members are required to attend trainings related to their roles annually. The materials used to train all members of the Pool are publicly posted here: www.umaryland.edu/titleix/training.
representative(s) from each of the Schools to serve as Hearing Panelists
Individuals who are interested in serving in the Pool are encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator.
8. Formal Grievance Process: Notice of Investigation and Allegations
The Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice of the investigation and allegations (the “NOIA”) to the Respondent upon commencement of the Formal Grievance Process. This facilitates the Respondent’s ability to prepare for the interview and to identify and choose an Advisor to accompany them. The NOIA is also copied to the Complainant, who is to be given advance notice of when the NOIA will be delivered to the Respondent.
The date and location of the alleged incident(s) (if known),
A statement of the potential sanctions/remedial actions that could result,
A statement that UMB presumes the Respondent is not responsible for the reported misconduct unless and until the evidence supports a different determination,
A statement that determinations of responsibility are made at the conclusion of the process and that the parties will be given an opportunity to inspect and review all directly related and/or relevant evidence obtained during the review and comment period,
Information on the need for each party to have an Advisor of their choosing and suggestions for ways to identify an Advisor,
A statement informing the parties that UMB’s Policy prohibits knowingly making false statements, including knowingly submitting false information during the resolution process,
Detail on how the party may request disability accommodations during the interview process,
A link to or physical copy of the UMB’s VAWA Brochure
The name(s) of the Investigator(s), along with a process to identify, in advance of the interview process, to the Title IX Coordinator any conflict of interest that the Investigator(s) may have, and
An instruction to preserve any evidence that is directly related to the allegations.
Amendments and updates to the NOIA may be made as the investigation progresses and more information becomes available regarding the addition or dismissal of various charges.
Notice will be made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the local or permanent address(es) of the parties as indicated in official UMB records, or emailed to the parties’ UMB-issued email or designated accounts. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered.
UMB will make a good faith effort to complete the resolution process within a sixty (60) business day time period, including appeal, which can be extended as necessary for appropriate cause by the Title IX Coordinator, who will provide notice and rationale for any extensions or delays to the parties as appropriate, as well as a estimate of how much additional time will be needed to complete the process.
Once the decision to commence a formal investigation is made, the Title IX Coordinator appoints a Pool member, or members, to conduct the investigation, usually within two (2) business days of determining that an investigation should proceed.
Any individual, including the Title IX Coordinator, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Investigator, Decision-maker(s), and Hearing Panelists, materially involved in the administration of the resolution process may neither have nor demonstrate a conflict of interest or bias for a party generally, or for a specific Complainant or Respondent.
The Title IX Coordinator will vet the assigned Investigator(s) to ensure impartiality by ensuring there are no actual or apparent conflicts of interest or disqualifying biases. The parties may, at any time during the resolution process, raise a concern regarding bias or conflict of interest, and the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether the concern is reasonable and supportable. If so, another Pool member will be assigned and the impact of the bias or conflict, if any, will be remedied. If the source of the conflict of interest or bias is the Title IX Coordinator, concerns should be raised with the Chief Accountability Officer.
The Formal Grievance Process involves an objective evaluation of all relevant evidence obtained, including evidence that supports that the Respondent engaged in a policy violation and evidence that supports that the Respondent did not engage in a policy violation. Credibility determinations may not be based solely on an individual’s status or participation as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness.
UMB is committed to due process.  It operates with the presumption that the Respondent is not responsible for the reported misconduct unless and until the Respondent is determined to be responsible for a policy violation by a preponderance of the evidence.
Investigations are completed expeditiously, normally within thirty (30) business days, though some investigations may take weeks or even months, depending on the nature, extent, and complexity of the allegations, availability of witnesses, police involvement, etc.
UMB will make a good faith effort to complete investigations as promptly as circumstances permit and will communicate regularly with the parties to update them on the progress and timing of the investigation.
13. Delays in the Investigation Process and Interactions with Law Enforcement
UMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to a few weeks) if circumstances require. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to: a request from law enforcement to temporarily delay the investigation, the need for language assistance, the absence of parties and/or witnesses, and/or accommodations for disabilities or health conditions.
UMB will communicate in writing the anticipated duration of the delay and reason to the parties, and provide the parties with status updates if necessary. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process as soon as feasible. During such a delay, UMB will implement supportive measures as deemed appropriate.
UMB’s action(s) or processes are not typically altered or precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.
All investigations are thorough, reliable, impartial, prompt, and fair. Investigations involve interviews with all relevant parties and witnesses; obtaining available, relevant evidence; and identifying sources of expert information, as necessary.
All parties have a full and fair opportunity, through the investigation process, to suggest witnesses and questions, to provide evidence and expert witnesses, and to fully review and respond to all evidence on the record.
The Investigator(s) typically take(s) the following steps, if not already completed (not necessarily in this order):
Determine the identity and contact information of the Complainant
In coordination with campus partners (e.g., the Title IX Coordinator), initiate or assist with any necessary supportive measures
Identify all policies implicated by the alleged misconduct and notify the Complainant and Respondent of all of the specific policies implicated
Assist the Title IX Coordinator with conducting a prompt initial assessment to determine if the allegations indicate a potential policy violation
Commence a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation by identifying issues and developing a strategic investigation plan, including a witness list, evidence list, intended investigation timeframe, and order of interviews for all witnesses and the parties
Meet with the Complainant to finalize their interview/statement, if necessary
Prepare and send the initial Notice of Investigation and Allegation (NOIA). The NOIA may be amended with any additional or dismissed allegations
a. The University’s complete Policy and Procedures as set forth herein;
b. The allegations of Prohibited Conduct as defined by the Policy;
d. Date(s), location(s), and time(s) of the alleged incident(s), if known;
e. Statement that the Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the adjudication process;
f. Parties may have an Advisor of their choice, who may be an attorney and who may inspect and review evidence;
g. If Parties do not select an Advisor of their choice, the University will provide a trained Advisor for purposes of performing cross-examination on behalf of that Party at the Hearing;
h. Parties may have a Support Person of their choice;
i. Advisement that knowingly making false statements or knowingly submitting false information during the investigation and adjudication process is prohibited under Section XII of the Policy;
j. If the University decides to investigate additional allegations about either Party that are not in the original notice, the Parties will receive an amended notice containing the additional allegations; and
k. The range of potential Sanctions associated with the alleged Prohibited Conduct.
Provide each interviewed party and witness an opportunity to review and verify the Investigator’s summary notes (or transcript) of the relevant evidence/testimony from their respective interviews and meetings
Make good faith efforts to notify the parties of any meeting or interview involving the other party, in advance when possible
When participation of a party is expected, provide that party with written notice of the date, time, and location of the meeting, as well as the expected participants and purpose
Interview all available, relevant witnesses and conduct follow-up interviews as necessary
Allow each party the opportunity to suggest witnesses and questions they wish the Investigator(s) to ask of the other party and witnesses, and document in the report which questions were asked, with a rationale for any changes or omissions
Complete the investigation promptly and without unreasonable deviation from the intended timeline
Provide regular status updates to the parties throughout the investigation
Prior to the conclusion of the investigation, provide the parties and their respective Advisors (if so desired by the parties) with a list of witnesses whose information will be used to render a finding
Write a comprehensive investigation report fully summarizing the investigation, all witness interviews, and addressing all relevant evidence. Appendices including relevant physical or documentary evidence will be included
The Investigator(s) gather, assess, and synthesize evidence, but make no conclusions, engage in no policy analysis, and render no recommendations as part of their report
Prior to the conclusion of the investigation, provide the parties and their respective Advisors (if a consent form has been properly completed and so desired by the parties) a secured electronic or hard copy of the draft investigation report as well as an opportunity to inspect and review all of the evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the reported misconduct, including evidence upon which UMB does not intend to rely in reaching a determination, for a ten (10) business day review and comment period so that each party may meaningfully respond to the evidence. The parties may elect to waive the full ten days. Each copy of the materials shared will be watermarked on each page with the role of the person receiving it (e.g., Complainant, Respondent, Complainant’s Advisor, Respondent’s Advisor).
The Investigator(s) may elect to respond in writing in the investigation report to the parties’ submitted responses and/or to share the responses between the parties for additional responses
The Investigator(s) will incorporate relevant elements of the parties’ written responses into the final investigation report, include any additional relevant evidence, make any necessary revisions, and finalize the report. The Investigator(s) should document all rationales for any changes made after the review and comment period
The Investigator(s) shares the report with the Title IX Coordinator and/or legal counsel for their review
The Investigator will incorporate any relevant feedback, and the final report is then shared with all parties and, if the proper Consent forms are completed, their Advisors through secure electronic transmission or hard copy at least ten (10) business days prior to a hearing. The parties are also provided with a file of any directly related evidence that was not included in the report.
15. Role and Participation of Witnesses in the Investigation
Witnesses (as distinguished from the parties) who are employees of UMB are required to cooperate with and participate in UMB’s investigation and resolution process. Failure of such witnesses to cooperate with and/or participate in the investigation or resolution process constitutes a violation of policy and may warrant discipline.
Although in-person interviews for parties and all potential witnesses are ideal, circumstances (e.g., study abroad, summer break) may require individuals to be interviewed remotely. Skype, Zoom, FaceTime, WebEx, or similar technologies may be used for interviews if the Investigator(s) determine that timeliness or efficiency dictate a need for remote interviewing. UMB will take appropriate steps to reasonably ensure the security/privacy of remote interviews.
Witnesses may also provide written statements in lieu of interviews or choose to respond to written questions, if deemed appropriate by the Investigator(s), though not preferred. If a witness submits a written statement but does not intend to be and is not present for cross examination at a hearing, their written statement may not be used as evidence.
No unauthorized audio or video recording of any kind is permitted during investigation meetings. If Investigator(s) elect to audio and/or video record interviews, all involved parties must be made aware of and consent to audio and/or video recording.
The investigation does not consider: 1) incidents not directly related to the possible violation, unless they evidence a pattern; 2) the character of the parties; or 3) questions and evidence about the Complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent.
Provided that the complaint is not resolved through Informal Resolution, once the final investigation report is shared with the parties, the Title IX Coordinator will refer the matter for a hearing.
The hearing cannot be less than ten (10) business days from the conclusion of the investigation –when the final investigation report is transmitted to the parties and the Decision-maker–unless all parties and the Decision-maker agree to an expedited timeline.
The Chief Accountability Officer, or their designee, serves as the Decision-maker for hearings.  The panel members for each hearing will be drawn from the Pool using a randomization process once any individuals in the Pool have been eliminated due to participation in the investigatory process, conflicts of interest, or bias.
The Decision-maker(s) will not have had any previous involvement with the investigation. The Title IX Coordinator may elect to have an alternate from the Pool sit in throughout the hearing process in the event that a substitute is needed for any reason.
Those who have served as Investigators will be witnesses in the hearing and therefore may not serve as Decision-makers. Those who are serving as Advisors for any party may not serve as Panelists in that matter.
The Title IX Coordinator may not serve as a Decision-maker or Chair in the matter but may serve as an administrative facilitator of the hearing if their previous role(s) in the matter do not create a conflict of interest. Otherwise, a designee may fulfill this role. The hearing will convene at a time determined by the Chair or designee.
Any evidence that the Decision-maker(s) determine(s) is relevant and credible may be considered. The hearing does not consider: 1) incidents not directly related to the possible violation, unless they evidence a pattern; 2) the character of the parties; or 3) questions and evidence about the Complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent.
Previous disciplinary action of any kind involving the Respondent may be considered in determining an appropriate sanction upon a determination of responsibility, assuming UMB uses a progressive discipline system. This information is only considered at the sanction stage of the process, and is not shared until then.
The parties may each submit a written impact statement prior to the hearing for the consideration of the Decision-maker(s) at the sanction stage of the process when a determination of responsibility is reached.
After post-hearing deliberation, the Decision-maker renders a determination based on a preponderance of the evidence; whether it is more likely than not that the Respondent violated the Policy as alleged.
No less than ten (10) business days prior to the hearing, the Title IX Coordinator will send notice of the hearing to the parties. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered.
A description of the alleged violation(s), a list of all policies allegedly violated, a description of the applicable procedures, and a statement of the potential sanctions/remedial actions that could result.
The time, date, and location of the hearing and a reminder that attendance is mandatory, superseding all other campus activities.
Any technology that will be used to facilitate the hearing.
Information about the option for the live hearing to occur with the parties located in separate rooms using technology that enables the Decision-maker(s) and parties to see and hear a party or witness answering questions. Such a request must be raised with the Title IX Coordinator at least five (5) business days prior to the hearing.
A list of all those who will attend the hearing, along with an invitation to object to any Decision-maker on the basis of demonstrated bias. This must be raised with the Title IX Coordinator at least two (2) business days prior to the hearing.
Information on how the hearing will be recorded and on access to the recording for the parties after the hearing.
A statement that if any party or witness does not appear at the scheduled hearing, the hearing may be held in their absence, and the party’s or witness’s testimony and any statements given prior to the hearing will not be considered by the Decision-maker(s). For compelling reasons, the Chair may reschedule the hearing.
Notification that the parties may have the assistance of an Advisor of their choosing at the hearing and will be required to have one present for any questions they may desire to ask. The party must notify the Title IX Coordinator if they do not have an Advisor, and UMB will appoint one. Each party must have an Advisor present. There are no exceptions.
A copy of all the materials provided to the Decision-maker(s) about the matter, unless they have been provided already.
An invitation to each party to submit to the Chair an impact statement pre-hearing that the Decision-maker will review during any sanction determination.
An invitation to contact the Title IX Coordinator to arrange any disability accommodations, language assistance, and/or interpretation services that may be needed at the hearing, at least seven (7) business days prior to the hearing.
Whether parties can/cannot bring mobile phones/devices into the hearing.
Hearings for possible violations that occur near or after the end of an academic term (assuming the Respondent is still subject to this Policy) and are unable to be resolved prior to the end of term will typically be held immediately after the end of the term or during the summer, as needed, to meet the resolution timeline followed by UMB and remain within the 60 business day goal for resolution.
In these cases, if the Respondent is a graduating student, a hold may be placed on graduation and/or official transcripts until the matter is fully resolved (including any appeal). A student facing charges under this Policy is not in good standing to graduate.
If a party or parties prefer not to attend or cannot attend the hearing in person, the party should request alternative arrangements from the Title IX Coordinator or the Chair at least five (5) business days prior to the hearing.
The Title IX Coordinator can arrange to use technology to allow remote testimony without compromising the fairness of the hearing. Remote options may also be needed for witnesses who cannot appear in person. Any witness who cannot attend in person should let the Title IX Coordinator or the Chair know at least five (5) business days prior to the hearing so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
The Chair or hearing facilitator after any necessary consultation with the parties, Investigator(s) and/or Title IX Coordinator, will provide the names of persons who will be participating in the hearing, all pertinent documentary evidence, and the final investigation report to the parties at least ten (10) business days prior to the hearing.
Any witness scheduled to participate in the hearing must have been first interviewed by the Investigator(s) or have proffered a written statement or answered written questions, unless all parties and the Chair assent to the witness’s participation in the hearing. The same holds for any evidence that is first offered at the hearing. If the parties and Chair do not assent to the admission of evidence newly offered at the hearing, the Chair may delay the hearing and instruct that the investigation needs to be re-opened to consider that evidence.
The parties will be given a list of the names of the Decision-maker and Panelists at least five (5) business days in advance of the hearing. All objections to any Decision-maker must be raised in writing, detailing the rationale for the objection, and must be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator as soon as possible and no later than one day prior to the hearing. Decision-makers will only be removed if the Title IX Coordinator concludes that their bias or conflict of interest precludes an impartial hearing of the allegation(s).
The Title IX Coordinator will give the Decision-maker(s) a list of the names of all parties, witnesses, and Advisors at least five (5) business days in advance of the hearing. Any Decision-maker who cannot make an objective determination must recuse themselves from the proceedings when notified of the identity of the parties, witnesses, and Advisors in advance of the hearing. If a Decision-maker is unsure of whether a bias or conflict of interest exists, they must raise the concern to the Title IX Coordinator as soon as possible.
During the ten (10) business day period prior to the hearing, the parties have the opportunity for continued review and comment on the final investigation report and available evidence. That review and comment can be shared with the Chair at the pre-hearing meeting or at the hearing and will be exchanged between each party by the Chair.
The parties and advisors will receive written notice of procedures for the hearing at least five (5) days in advance.
The Chair may convene a pre-hearing meeting(s) with the parties and their Advisors to invite them to submit the questions or topics each party wishes to ask or discuss at the hearing, so that the Chair can rule on their relevance ahead of time to avoid any improper evidentiary introduction in the hearing or provide recommendations for more appropriate phrasing. However, this advance review opportunity does not preclude the Advisors from asking a question for the first time at the hearing or from asking for a reconsideration based on any new information or testimony offered at the hearing. The Chair must document and share with each party their rationale for any exclusion or inclusion at a pre-hearing meeting.
The Chair, only with full agreement of the parties, may decide in advance of the hearing that certain witnesses do not need to be present if their testimony can be adequately summarized by the Investigator(s) in the investigation report or during the hearing.
At each pre-hearing meeting with a party and their Advisor, the Chair will consider arguments that evidence identified in the final investigation report as relevant is, in fact, not relevant. Similarly, evidence identified as directly related but not relevant by the Investigator(s) may be argued to be relevant. The Chair may rule on these arguments pre-hearing and will exchange those rulings between the parties prior to the hearing to assist in preparation for the hearing. The Chair may consult with legal counsel and/or the Title IX Coordinator, or ask either or both to attend pre-hearing meetings.
At the hearing, the Decision-maker(s) has the authority to hear and make determinations on all allegations of discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation and may also hear and make determinations on any additional alleged policy violations that have occurred in concert with the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation, even though those collateral allegations may not specifically fall within the Policy.
Participants at the hearing will include the Chair, any additional panelists, the hearing facilitator, the Investigator(s) who conducted the investigation, the parties (or three (3) organizational representatives when an organization is the Respondent), Advisors to the parties, any called witnesses, the Title IX Coordinator, and anyone providing authorized accommodations or assistive services.
The Chair will answer all questions of procedure. Anyone appearing at the hearing to provide information will respond to questions on their own behalf.
The Chair will allow witnesses who have relevant information to appear at a portion of the hearing in order to respond to specific questions from the Panelists and the parties and the witnesses will then be excused.
In hearings involving more than one Respondent or in which two (2) or more Complainants have accused the same individual of substantially similar conduct, the default procedure will be to hear the allegations jointly.
However, the Title IX Coordinator may permit the investigation and/or hearings pertinent to each Respondent to be conducted separately if there is a compelling reason to do so. In joint hearings, separate determinations of responsibility will be made for each Respondent with respect to each alleged policy violation.
27. The Order of the Hearing – Introductions and Explanation of Procedure
The Chair explains the procedures and introduces the participants. This may include a final opportunity for challenge or recusal of any member of the Hearing Panel on the basis of bias or conflict of interest. The Chair will rule on any such challenge unless the Chair is the individual who is the subject of the challenge, in which case the Title IX Coordinator will review and decide the challenge.
At the hearing, recording, witness logistics, party logistics, curation of documents, separation of the parties, and other administrative elements of the hearing process are managed by a non-voting hearing facilitator, either the Title IX Coordinator or an individual appointed by the Title IX Coordinator. The hearing facilitator may attend to: logistics of rooms for various parties/witnesses as they wait; flow of parties/witnesses in and out of the hearing space; ensuring recording and/or virtual conferencing technology is working as intended; copying and distributing materials to participants, as appropriate, etc.
28. Investigator Presents the Final Investigation Report
The Investigator(s) will then present a summary of the final investigation report, including items that are contested and those that are not, and will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Panelists and the parties (through their Advisors). The Investigator(s) will be present during the entire hearing process, but not during deliberations.
Neither the parties nor the Hearing Panel should ask the Investigator(s) their opinions on credibility, recommended findings, or determinations, and the Investigators, Advisors, and parties will refrain from discussion of or questions about these assessments. If such information is introduced, the Chair will direct that it be disregarded.
Once the Investigator(s) present their report and are questioned, the parties and witnesses may provide relevant information in turn, beginning with the Complainant, and then in the order determined by the Chair. The parties/witnesses will submit to questioning by the Hearing Panel and then by the parties through their Advisors (“cross-examination”).
All questions are subject to a relevance determination by the Chair. The Advisor, who will remain seated during questioning, will pose the proposed question orally, electronically, or in writing (orally is the default, but other means of submission may be permitted by the Chair upon request if agreed to by all parties and the Chair), the proceeding will pause to allow the Chair to consider it (and state it if it has not been stated aloud), and the Chair will determine whether the question will be permitted, disallowed, or rephrased.
The Chair may invite explanations or persuasive statements regarding relevance with the Advisors, if the Chair so chooses. The Chair will then state their decision on the question for the record and advise the party/witness to whom the question was directed, accordingly. The Chair will explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant, or to reframe it for relevance.
The Chair will limit or disallow questions on the basis that they are irrelevant, unduly repetitious (and thus irrelevant), or abusive. The Chair has final say on all questions and determinations of relevance. The Chair may consult with legal counsel on any questions of admissibility. The Chair may ask Advisors to frame why a question is or is not relevant from their perspective but will not entertain argument from the Advisors on relevance once the Chair has ruled on a question.
If the parties raise an issue of bias or conflict of interest of an Investigator or Hearing Panelist at the hearing, the Chair may elect to address those issues, consult with legal counsel, and/or refer them to the Title IX Coordinator, and/or preserve them for appeal. If bias is not in issue at the hearing, the Chair should not permit irrelevant questions that probe for bias.
30. Refusal to Submit to Cross-Examination and Inferences
If a party or witness chooses not to submit to cross-examination at the hearing, either because they do not attend the meeting, or they attend but refuse to participate in questioning, then the Decision-maker(s) may not rely on any prior statement made by that party or witness at the hearing (including those contained in the investigation report) in the ultimate determination of responsibility. The Decision-maker(s) must disregard that statement. Evidence provided that is something other than a statement by the party or witness may be considered.
If the party or witness attends the hearing and answers some cross-examination questions, only statements related to the cross-examination questions they refuse to answer cannot be relied upon. However, if the statements of the party who is refusing to submit to cross-examination or refuses to attend the hearing are the subject of the allegation itself (e.g., the case is about verbal harassment or a quid pro quo offer), then those statements are not precluded from admission. Similarly, statements can be relied upon when questions are posed by the Hearing Panelists, as distinguished from questions posed by Advisors through cross-examination.
The Hearing Panelists may not draw any inference solely from a party’s or witness’s absence from the hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions.
If charges of policy violations other than sexual harassment are considered at the same hearing, the Hearing Panelists may consider all evidence it deems relevant, may rely on any relevant statement as long as the opportunity for cross-examination is afforded to all parties through their Advisors, and may draw reasonable inferences from any decision by any party or witness not to participate or respond to questions.
If a party’s Advisor of choice refuses to comply with UMB’s established rules of decorum for the hearing, UMB may require the party to use a different Advisor. If a UMB-provided Advisor refuses to comply with the rules of decorum, UMB may provide that party with a different Advisor to conduct cross-examination on behalf of that party.
Hearings (but not deliberations) are recorded by UMB for purposes of review in the event of an appeal. The parties may not record the proceedings and no other unauthorized recordings are permitted.
The Hearing Panelists, the parties, their Advisors, and appropriate administrators of UMB will be permitted to listen to the recording in a controlled environment determined by the Title IX Coordinator. No person will be given or be allowed to make a copy of the recording without permission of the Title IX Coordinator.
32. Deliberation, Decision-making, and Standard of Proof
The Hearing Panelists will deliberate in closed session to determine whether the Respondent is responsible or not responsible for the policy violation(s) in question. A simple majority vote is required to determine the finding. The preponderance of the evidence standard of proof is used. The hearing facilitator may be invited to attend the deliberation by the Chair, but is there only to facilitate procedurally, not to address the substance of the allegations.
When there is a finding of responsibility on one or more of the allegations, the Hearing Panelists may then consider the previously submitted party impact statements in determining appropriate sanction(s).
The Chair will ensure that each of the parties has an opportunity to review any impact statement submitted by the other party(ies). The Hearing Panelists may – at their discretion – consider the statements, but they are not binding.
The Hearing Panelists will review the statements and any pertinent conduct history that may have been provided by the party’s School or administrative unit and will determine the appropriate sanction(s).
The Chair will then prepare a written deliberation statement and deliver it to the Title IX Coordinator, detailing the determination, rationale, the evidence used in support of its determination, the evidence not relied upon in its determination, credibility assessments, and any remedial actions or sanctions.
This report is typically three (3) to five (5) pages in length and must be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator within five (5) business days of the end of deliberations, unless the Title IX Coordinator grants an extension. If an extension is granted, the Title IX Coordinator will notify the parties.
Using the deliberation statement, the Title IX Coordinator will work with the Chair to prepare a Notice of Outcome, which may be reviewed by legal counsel. The Title IX Coordinator will then share the letter, including the final determination, rationale, and any applicable remedial actions and/or sanction(s) with the parties and their Advisors within seven (7) business days of receiving the Decision-maker(s)’ deliberation statement.
The Notice of Outcome will then be shared with the parties simultaneously. Notification will be made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in official UMB records, or emailed to the parties’ UMB-issued email or otherwise approved account. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered.
The Notice of Outcome will articulate the specific policy(ies) reported to have been violated, including the relevant policy section, and will contain a description of the procedural steps taken by UMB from the receipt of the misconduct report to the determination, including any and all notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to obtain evidence, and hearings held.
The Notice of Outcome will specify the finding on each alleged policy violation; the findings of fact that support the determination; conclusions regarding the application of the relevant policy to the facts at issue; a statement of, and rationale for, the result of each allegation to the extent UMB is permitted to share such information under state or federal law; any sanctions issued which UMB is permitted to share according to state or federal law; and any remedies provided to the Complainant designed to ensure access to the UMB’s educational or employment program or activity, to the extent UMB is permitted to share such information under state or federal law (this detail is not typically shared with the Respondent unless the remedy directly relates to the Respondent).
The Notice of Outcome will also include information on when the results are considered by UMB to be final, any changes that occur prior to finalization, and the relevant procedures and bases for any available appeal options.
Factors considered when determining a sanction/remedial action may include, but are not limited to:
The nature, severity of, and circumstances surrounding the violation(s)
Previous allegations or allegations involving similar conduct
The need for sanctions/remedial actions to bring an end to the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation
The need for sanctions/remedial actions to prevent the future recurrence of
The need to remedy the effects of the discrimination, harassment, and/or discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation on the Complainant and the community
Any other information deemed relevant by the Decision-maker(s)
The sanctions will be implemented as soon as is feasible, either upon the outcome of any appeal or the expiration of the window to appeal without an appeal being requested.
The sanctions described in the Policy are not exclusive of, and may be in addition to, other actions taken or sanctions imposed by external authorities or entities.
The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:
Warning: A formal statement that the conduct was unacceptable and a warning that further violation of any UMB policy, procedure, or directive will result in more severe sanctions/remedial actions.
Probation: A written reprimand for violation of institutional policy, providing for more severe disciplinary sanctions in the event that the student or organization is found in violation of any institutional policy, procedure, or directive within a specified period of time. Terms of the probation will be articulated and may include denial of specified social privileges, exclusion from co-curricular activities, exclusion from designated areas of campus, no-contact orders, and/or other measures deemed appropriate.
Suspension: Termination of student status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Students who return from suspension are automatically placed on probation through the remainder of their tenure as a student at UMB.
Dismissal: Permanent termination of student status and revocation of rights to be on campus for any reason or to attend UMB-sponsored events. This sanction will be noted permanently as a Conduct Expulsion on the student’s official transcript.
Required Counseling: A mandate to meet with and engage in either UMB-sponsored or external counseling to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.
Required Training or Education: A mandate to engage in either UMB-sponsored or external training or educational programs to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.
Withholding Degree: UMB may withhold a student’s degree for a specified period of time and/or deny a student participation in commencement activities if the student has an allegation pending or as a sanction if the student is found responsible for an alleged violation.
Revocation of Degree: UMB reserves the right to revoke a degree previously awarded from the UMB for fraud, misrepresentation, and/or other violation of UMB policies, procedures, or directives in obtaining the degree, or for other serious violations committed by a student prior to graduation.
Transcript Notation: A permanent notation on the student’s official transcript of the policy violation.
Other Actions: In addition to or in place of the above sanctions, UMB may assign any other sanctions as deemed appropriate.
The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:
Warning – Verbal or Written: A formal verbal or written statement that the conduct was unacceptable and a warning that further violation of any UMB policy, procedure, or directive will result in more severe sanctions/remedial actions.
Performance Improvement Plan: Inclusion of the violation on the employee’s Performance Improvement Plan with corrective actions to be taken by the employee.
Required Counseling: A mandate to meet with and engage in either UMB-sponsored or external counseling to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.
Required Training or Education: A mandate to engage in either UMB-sponsored or external training or educational programs to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.
Demotion: Lowering the employee’s status, title, and, if appropriate, pay.
Suspension with pay: Termination of employee’s status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Employees who return from suspension with pay are automatically placed on probation for a period to be determined at the time of suspension. The employee will continue to receive their base salary during the suspension period.
Suspension without pay: Termination of employee’s status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Employees who return from suspension with pay are automatically placed on probation for a period to be determined at the time of suspension. The employee will not receive their salary during the suspension period.
Termination: UMB will end its employment agreement with the employee. The employee will not be eligible to be re-hired by UMB.
Other Actions: In addition to or in place of the above sanctions/remedial actions, UMB may assign any other remedial actions as deemed appropriate.
The Policy on Sexual Misconduct provides the potential outcomes should a student withdrawal or resign with charges are pending.
The Policy on Sexual Misconduct provides the potential outcomes should an employee resign with charges are pending.
Any party may file a request for appeal (“Request for Appeal”), but it must be submitted in writing to the Title IX Coordinator within five (5) days of the delivery of the Notice of Outcome.
A single Appeal Decision-maker (“Appeal Chair”) will hear the appeal, who has not been previously involved in the process, including any dismissal appeal that may have been heard.
The Request for Appeal will be forwarded to the Appeal Chair for consideration to determine if the request meets the grounds for appeal (a Review for Standing).
This review of the Request for Appeal is not a review of the merits of the appeal, but solely a determination as to whether the request meets the grounds and is timely filed.
(A) Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;
(B) New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; and
(C) The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Panelist(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the specific Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.
If any of the grounds in the Request for Appeal do not meet the grounds in this Policy, that request will be denied by the Appeal Chair and the parties and their Advisors will be notified in writing of the denial and the rationale.
If any of the grounds in the Request for Appeal meet the grounds in this Policy, then the Appeal Chair will notify the other party(ies) and their Advisors, the Title IX Coordinator, and, when appropriate, the Investigators and/or the original Hearing Panelists.
The other party(ies) and their Advisors, the Title IX Coordinator, and, when appropriate, the Investigators and/or the original Hearing Panelists will be mailed, emailed, and/or provided a hard copy of the request with the approved grounds and then be given five (5) business days to submit a response to the portion of the appeal that was approved and involves them. All responses will be forwarded by the Chair to all parties for review and comment.
The non-appealing party (if any) may also choose to raise a new ground for appeal at this time. If so, that will be reviewed to determine if it meets the grounds in this Policy by the Appeal Chair and either denied or approved. If approved, it will be forwarded to the party who initially requested an appeal, the Investigator(s) and/or original Hearing Panelist(s), as necessary, who will submit their responses in five (5) business days, which will be circulated for review and comment by all parties.
Neither party may submit any new requests for appeal after this time period. The Appeal Chair will collect any additional information needed and all documentation regarding the approved grounds and the subsequent responses and the Appeal Chair will render a decision in no more than seven (7) business days, barring exigent circumstances. All decisions apply the preponderance of the evidence standard.
A Notice of Appeal Outcome will be sent to all parties simultaneously including the decision on each approved ground and rationale for each decision. The Notice of Appeal Outcome will specify the finding on each ground for appeal, any specific instructions for remand or reconsideration, any sanctions that may result which UMB is permitted to share according to state or federal law, and the rationale supporting the essential findings to the extent UMB is permitted to share under state or federal law.
Notification will be made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in official UMB records, or emailed to the parties’ UMB-issued email or otherwise approved account. Once mailed, emailed and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered.
Any sanctions imposed as a result of the hearing are stayed during the appeal process. Supportive measures may be maintained or, if necessary reinstated, subject to the same supportive measure procedures above.
If any of the sanctions are to be implemented immediately post-hearing, but pre-appeal, then emergency removal procedures (detailed above) for a hearing on the justification for doing so must be permitted within 48 hours of implementation.
UMB may still place holds on official transcripts, diplomas, graduations, and course registration pending the outcome of an appeal when the original sanctions included separation.
Decisions on appeal are to be deferential to the original decision, making changes to the finding only when there is clear error and to the sanction(s)/remedial action(s) only if there is a compelling justification to do so.
Appeals are not intended to provide for a full re-hearing (de novo) of the allegation(s). In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation or record of the original hearing and pertinent documentation regarding the specific grounds for appeal.
An appeal is not an opportunity for the Appeal Chair to substitute his/her judgment for that of the original Decision-maker(s) merely because he/she disagree with the finding and/or sanction(s).
The Appeal Chair may consult with the Title IX Coordinator on questions of procedure or rationale, for clarification, if needed. Documentation of all such consultation will be maintained.
Appeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the original Investigator(s) and/or Decision-maker(s) for reconsideration. Other appeals may be remanded at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator or, in limited circumstances, decided on appeal.
Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final: further appeals are not permitted, even if a decision or sanction is changed on remand (except in the case of a new hearing).
In rare cases where a procedural [or substantive] error cannot be cured by the original Hearing Panelist(s) (as in cases of bias), the appeal may order a new hearing with a new Hearing Panelist(s).
The results of a remand to the Hearing Panelists cannot be appealed.
In cases in which the appeal results in reinstatement to UMB or resumption of privileges, all reasonable attempts will be made to restore the Respondent to their prior status, recognizing that some opportunities lost may be irreparable in the short term.
Following the conclusion of the resolution process, and in addition to any sanctions implemented, the Title IX Coordinator may implement additional long-term remedies or actions with respect to the parties and/or the campus community that are intended to stop the harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation, remedy the effects, and prevent reoccurrence.
These remedies/actions may include, but are not limited to:
Permanent alteration of work arrangements for employees
Implementation of long-term contact limitations between the parties
Implementation of adjustments to academic deadlines, course schedules, etc.
At the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, certain long-term support or measures may also be provided to the parties even if no policy violation is found.
When no policy violation is found, the Title IX Coordinator will address any remedies owed by UMB to the Respondent to ensure no effective denial of educational access.
UMB will maintain the privacy of any long-term remedies/actions/measures, provided privacy does not impair UMB’s ability to provide these services.
39. Failure to Comply with Sanctions and/or Interim and Long-term Remedies and/or Remedial Actions
All Respondents are expected to comply with the assigned sanctions, remedial actions, and/or corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the final Decision-maker(s) (including the Appeal Chair).
Failure to abide by the sanction(s)/action(s) imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanction(s)/action(s), including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination from UMB and may be noted on a student’s official transcript.
A suspension will only be lifted when compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.
UMB will maintain for a period of seven years records of:
Each sexual harassment investigation including any determination regarding responsibility and any audio or audiovisual recording or transcript required under federal regulation;
Any disciplinary sanctions imposed on the Respondent;
Any remedies provided to the Complainant designed to restore or preserve equal access to UMB’s education program or activity;
All materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, Investigators, Decision-makers, and any person who facilitates an Informal Resolution process. UMB will make these training materials publicly available on UMB’s website or available for public inspection upon request; and
Any actions, including any supportive measures, taken in response to a report or formal complaint of sexual harassment, including:
The basis for all conclusions that the response was not deliberately indifferent;
Any measures designed to restore or preserve equal access to UMB’s education program or activity; and
If no supportive measures were provided to the Complainant, document the reasons why such a response was not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.
UMB will also maintain any and all records in accordance with state and federal laws.
41. Disabilities Accommodations in the Resolution Process
UMB is committed to providing reasonable accommodations and support to qualified students, employees, or others with disabilities to ensure equal access to the UMB’s resolution process.
Students needing such accommodations or support should complete the Disability and Reasonable Accommodations form located on the Educational Support and Disability Services website located at: https://www.umaryland.edu/disabilityservices/for-students/how-to-request-accommodations/.  Employees should complete the Request for Reasonable Accommodation form and submitting it to Human Resource Services (HRS) Employee Labor Relations (ELR), Office of Diversity, ADA and Affirmative Action located at https://www.umaryland.edu/hrs/current-employees/diversity-ada-aa/americans-with-disabilities-act/. Students and employees seeking accommodations or support should inform the Title IX Coordinator when they have submitted the request(s) to allow for consultation to determine which accommodations are appropriate and necessary for full participation in the process.
These procedures supersede any previous procedures for addressing harassment, sexual misconduct, discrimination, and/or retaliation under Title IX and will be reviewed and updated annually by the Title IX Coordinator. UMB reserves the right to make changes to this document as necessary, and once those changes are posted online, they are in effect.
During the resolution process, the Title IX Coordinator may make minor modifications to procedures that do not materially jeopardize the fairness owed to any party, such as to accommodate summer schedules. The Title IX Coordinator may also vary procedures materially with notice (on the institutional website, with the appropriate effective date identified) upon determining that changes to law or regulation require policy or procedural alterations not reflected in these procedures.
If government laws or regulations change – or court decisions alter – the requirements in a way that impacts this document, this document will be construed to comply with the most recent government regulations or holdings.
This document does not create legally enforceable protections beyond the protection of the background state and federal laws which frame such policies and codes, generally.

UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 "Non-Title IX Procedures"
To describe how UMB will respond to allegations of harassment or discrimination on the basis of protected class status involving students, staff, faculty members, or third parties, that do not fall into under the jurisdiction of the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX).
The procedures described below apply to all allegations of harassment or discrimination on the basis of protected class status involving students, staff, faculty members, or third parties, that do not fall into under the jurisdiction of the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX).
UMB will act on any formal or informal allegation or notice of violation of the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct that is received by the Title IX Coordinator or a member of the administration, faculty, or other employee, with the exception of confidential resources, as articulated in UMB’s Policy on Sexual Misconduct.
The procedures described below apply to all allegations of harassment or discrimination on the basis of protected class status involving students, staff, faculty members, or third parties, that do not fall into under the jurisdiction of the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX).   Allegations that are assessed to be potential violations of the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct that are within the scope of Title IX will be processed using the UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Federal Regulations Implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 “Title IX Procedures.”   VAWA Section 304 requirements apply to this, or any alternative process, for reports that fall under VAWA. Title IX requirements outside of Section 106.30 (based on the original 1975 regulations, the 2001 Revised Guidance, etc.) may also apply to these Non-Title IX Procedures.
These procedures may also be used to resolve non-sexual misconduct violations of UMB policy if the collateral misconduct arises from the investigation of or occurring in conjunction with the alleged discriminatory sexual conduct. Other allegations of misconduct unrelated to sexual misconduct allegations will be addressed through other appropriate UMB procedures.
These procedures incorporate by reference the definitions in the UMB Policy.
Following intake, receipt of notice, or a complaint of an alleged violation of the UMB’s Policy on Sexual Misconduct (the “Policy”), the Title IX Coordinator engages in a prompt Initial Assessment and a reasonable cause assessment to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support further review of the complaint under the UMB Policy, and to determine the next steps UMB will take.  The Initially Assessment typically takes one to five business days.
If the initial assessment determines the alleged misconduct does not fall under the scope of Title IX but may be violation of the UMB Policy the Title IX Coordinator will send a Notice of Dismissal under the Title IX Procedures that includes confirmation these Non-Title IX Procedures will be applied to assess and address the alleged misconduct.
The initial assessment includes, but is not limited to:
The Title IX Coordinator reaches out to the Complainant to offer supportive measures.
The Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to ensure they have an Advisor.
The Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to determine whether the Complainant prefers a supportive response or an Administrative Resolution.
If a supportive and remedial response is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to identify their preferences and then seeks to facilitate implementation. The Administrative Resolution process is not initiated, though the Complainant can elect to initiate it later, if desired.
If an Informal Resolution option is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator assesses whether the complaint is suitable for informal resolution, [which informal mechanism may serve the situation best or is available] and may seek to determine if the Respondent is also willing to engage in Informal Resolution.
If Administrative Resolution is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator initiates the investigation process and determines whether the scope of the investigation will address:
In many cases, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that a Violence Risk Assessment (VRA) should be conducted by the UMB Behavioral Awareness and Threat Assessment (BETA) Team as part of the Initial Assessment. A VRA can aid in ten critical and/or required determinations, including:
Interim suspension of a Respondent who is a threat to health/safety;
Whether the Title IX Coordinator should pursue Administrative Resolution absent a willing/able Complainant;
Whether to put the investigation on the footing of incident and/or pattern and/or climate;
Whether to permit a voluntary withdrawal by the Respondent;
Whether to impose transcript notation or communicate with a transfer about a Respondent;
Whether a Clery Act Timely Warning/Trespass order/Persona-non-grata is needed.
Based on the Initial Assessment, UMB will initiate one of two responses under these Non-Title IX Procedures:
Informal Resolution – typically used for less serious offenses and only when all parties agree, or when the Respondent is willing to accept responsibility for violating policy. This can also include a remedies-only response.
Administrative Resolution following Formal Investigation – formal investigation of allegation(s) and recommended findings, subject to a determination by a Decision-maker and the opportunity to appeal to an Appeal Panel/Appeal Decision-maker.
The Formal Investigation and the subsequent Administrative Resolution determine whether the UMB Policy has been violated. If so, UMB will promptly implement effective remedies designed to end the discrimination, prevent recurrence, and address the effects.
The process followed considers the preference of the parties but is ultimately determined at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator. At any point during the Initial Assessment, the Informal Resolution or the Administrative Resolution, the process will end if the Title IX Coordinator determines that the alleged misconduct is subject not to the jurisdiction of the UMB Policy or that there is insufficient evidence to supports further Informal Resolution or Administrative Resolution activity under the UMB Policy. In which case, the process will end, and the parties will be notified.
The Complainant may request that the Title IX Coordinator review the determination to end the Informal Resolution or Administrative Resolution and/re-open the investigation. This decision lies in the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, with oversight of the Chief Accountability Officer, and must be based on good cause shown.
Counterclaims by the Respondent may be made in good faith but are also sometimes made for purposes of retaliation. UMB is obligated to ensure that any process is not abused for retaliatory purposes.
UMB permits the filing of counterclaims, and uses the Initial Assessment, described above, to assess whether the allegations are made in good faith and if there is evidence supporting a conclusion the allegation was made for purposes of retaliatory or other improper purposes, in which case the Title IX Coordinator may dismiss the counterclaim, subject to a Respondent’s request that the Title IX Coordinator review the dismissal and re-open the investigation.  This decision lies in the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator with oversight of the Chief Accountability Officer and must be based on good cause shown.  This decision may be appealed by either party within five (5) days of receipt of the written decision to dismiss through the process included for appeals herein.  Counterclaims will be processed using the resolution procedures below, typically after resolution of the underlying allegation.
A delay in the processing of counterclaims is permitted, accordingly. Occasionally, allegations and counterclaims can be resolved through the same Informal Resolution or Administrative Resolution - Formal Investigation, at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator. When counterclaims are not made in good faith, they will be considered retaliatory, and may constitute a violation of UMB Policy.
An individual serving as an Advisor should not accept role the before considering UMB’s expectations as follows:
UMB generally expects an Advisor to have a sufficiently flexible schedule to allow the Advisor to attend all meetings when planned.   UMB will consider requests to change scheduled meetings to accommodate an Advisor’s inability to attend, if doing so does not cause an unreasonable burden or delay.
UMB may also make reasonable provisions to allow an Advisor who cannot attend a meeting in person to attend a meeting by telephone, video conferencing, or other similar technology as may be convenient and available.
Parties whose Advisors are disruptive or who do not abide by UMB policies and procedures may be required to select an alternative Advisor.
Advisors are expected to consult with their advisees without disrupting UMB meetings or interviews. Advisors do not represent parties in the process as legal advocates.  The Advisor’s role is only to advise their advisee.
b. Expectations of the Parties with Respect to Advisors
Each party may choose an Advisor who is eligible and available to accompany them throughout the process. The Advisor can be anyone, including an attorney, but cannot be someone who is also a witness in the process or whom otherwise may be involved in or have a direct interest in the circumstances of the complaint.  A party may elect to change Advisors during the process and is not obligated to use the same Advisor throughout.
The parties are expected to inform the investigator(s) of the identity of their Advisor at least two (2) business days before the date of their first meeting with the Investigator(s) (or as soon as  possible if a more expeditious meeting is necessary or desired).
The parties are expected to provide timely notice to the Investigator(s) and/or the Title IX Coordinator if they change Advisors at any time.
UMB will not copy the Advisor on all communications between the UMB and the party. It is the responsibility of the parties to keep their Advisors informed.  The Advisor may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) regarding private, sensitive records and information.
For parties who are entitled to union representation, UMB will allow the unionized employee to have their union representative (if requested by the party) as well as an Advisor of their choice present for all resolution-related meetings and interviews. To uphold the principles of equity, the other party (regardless of union membership) will also be permitted to have two Advisors. Witnesses are/are not permitted to have union representation or Advisors in grievance process interviews or meetings.
At the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, more than one Advisor may be permitted to the parties, upon request.  For equity purposes, if one party is allowed another Advisor, the other party must be allowed one to as well.
UMB does not provide Advisors under this Non-Title IX Procedure.
For representation, Respondents may wish to contact organizations such as:
Complainants may wish to contact organizations such as:
The Victim Rights Law Center (http://www.victimrights.org)
The National Center for Victims of Crime (http://www.victimsofcrime.org), which maintains the Crime Victim’s Bar Association
The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund: https://nwlc.org/times-up-legal-defense-fund/
Proceedings under the Policy, records of the matter, including copies of evidence and related communications, are confidential. All persons present at any time during the resolution process are expected to maintain the confidentiality of the proceedings.
While there is an expectation of confidentiality regarding interviews, the parties have discretion to share their own experiences with others if they so choose, provided confidential and legally protected information is not improperly shared.  Parties are also encouraged to discuss the appropriateness of sharing information with their Advisors first before making disclosures.
Informal Resolution is applicable when the parties voluntarily agree to resolve the matter through Alternate Resolution, or when the Respondent accepts responsibility for violating the Policy, or when the Title IX Coordinator can resolve the matter informally by providing remedies to resolve the situation.
It is not necessary to pursue Informal Resolution first in order to pursue Administrative Resolution, and any party participating in Informal Resolution can stop the process at any time and request the Administrative Resolution process. Further, if an Informal Resolution fails, Administrative Resolution may be pursued.
Alternate Resolution is a type of Informal Resolution process, and includes options such as mediation or restorative practices, by which the parties mutually agree to resolve an allegation. It may be used for less serious, yet potentially offensive, behaviors and is encouraged as an alternative to the Administrative Resolution process (described below) to resolve conflicts. The parties must consent to the use of Alternate Resolution.
The Title IX Coordinator determines if Alternate Resolution is appropriate, based on the willingness of the parties, the nature of the conduct at issue, and the susceptibility of the conduct to Alternate Resolution.
In an Alternate Resolution meeting, a trained administrator facilitates a dialogue with the parties to reach an effective resolution, if possible.
The Title IX Coordinator maintains records of any resolution that is reached, and failure to abide by the resolution can result in appropriate corrective actions to achieve compliance.
Alternate Resolution is not typically the primary resolution mechanism used to address reports of violent behavior of any kind or in other cases of serious violations of policy, though it may be made available after the Administrative Resolution process is completed should the parties and the Title IX Coordinator believe it could be beneficial. The results of Alternate Resolution are not appealable.
ii. Respondent Accepts Responsibility for Alleged Violations
The Respondent may accept responsibility for all or part of the alleged policy violations at any point during the resolution process. If the Respondent accepts responsibility, the Title IX Coordinator makes a determination that the individual has admitted to violation of UMB Policy.
The Title IX Coordinator then determines appropriate sanction(s) or remedial actions, which are promptly implemented in order to effectively stop the harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation; prevent its recurrence; and remedy the effects of the conduct, both on the Complainant and the community.
If the Respondent accepts responsibility for all of the alleged policy violations and the Title IX Coordinator or designee has determined appropriate sanction(s) or remedial actions, which are promptly implemented, the resolution process is over. The Complainant will be informed of this outcome.  And conclusion of the complaint will be recorded in the Title IX Coordinator files.
If the Respondent accepts responsibility for some of the alleged policy violations but not others.  The Title IX Coordinator will determine appropriate sanction(s) or remedial actions, to be promptly implemented, for admitted violations.   The remaining allegations will continue to be investigated and resolved. The Complainant will be informed of this outcome. The parties are still able to seek Alternate Resolution on the remaining allegations, subject to the procedures above.
The Title IX Coordinator, with the consent of the parties, may negotiate and implement an agreement to resolve the allegations that satisfies UMB and all parties.
Administrative Resolution can be pursued for any behavior for which the Respondent has not accepted responsibility that constitutes conduct covered by the UMB Policy which is outside the scope of Title IX at any time during the process. Administrative Resolution starts with a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation.
If Administrative Resolution is initiated, the Title IX Coordinator will provide written notification of the investigation to the parties.  Typically, notice to a party or witness of an Investigation interview is given at least 48 hours in advance of the interview. Advanced notice facilitates the parties’ ability to identify and choose an Advisor, if any, to accompany them to the interview.
Notification of an Investigation will include a meaningful summary of the allegations, will be made in writing, and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in official UMB records, or emailed to the parties’ UMB-issued or designated email account.
Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered. The notification of an Investigation will identify the policies allegedly violated, if known at the time. Alternatively, the policies allegedly violated can be provided at a later date, in writing, as the investigation progresses, and details become clearer.
UMB aims to complete all investigations within a thirty (30) business days, which can be extended as necessary by the Title IX Coordinator when good cause has been shown, with notice to the parties as appropriate. Investigations are completed expeditiously, though some investigations take weeks or even months, depending on the nature, extent, and complexity of the allegations, availability of witnesses, police involvement, etc.
UMB will make a good faith effort to complete investigations as promptly as circumstances permit and will communicate regularly with the parties to update them on the progress and timing of the investigation.
UMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to weeks) to allow evidence collection when criminal charges based on the same behaviors that invoke UMB’s resolution process are being investigated by law enforcement. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process once notified by law enforcement that the initial evidence collection process is complete.
UMB action(s) are not typically delayed, altered or precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.
Once the decision is made to commence an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator assigns an Investigator to conduct the investigation, usually within two (2) business days of determining that an investigation should proceed. At the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, more than one Investigator may be assigned.
The Title IX Coordinator will vet the assigned Investigator(s) to ensure impartiality by ensuring there are no conflicts of interest or disqualifying bias.
The parties may, at any time during this process, raise a concern regarding bias or conflict of interest, and the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether the concern is reasonable and supportable. If so, another Investigator will be assigned and the impact of the bias or conflict, if any, will be remedied if necessary. If the bias or conflict relates to the Title IX Coordinator, concerns should be raised with the Chief Accountability Officer.
Investigations involve interviews with all relevant parties and witnesses, obtaining available, relevant evidence, and identifying sources of expert information, as necessary.
All parties have a full and fair opportunity, though the investigation process, to suggest witnesses and questions, to provide evidence, and to fully review and respond to all relevant evidence, on the record.
The Investigators typically take the following steps, if not already completed (not necessarily in this order):
Determine the identity and contact information of the Complainant
In coordination with campus partners (e.g., the Title IX Coordinator), initiate or assist with any necessary supportive measures
Identify all policies implicated by the alleged misconduct
Assist the Title IX Coordinator with conducting an initial assessment to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe the Respondent has violated policy
If there is insufficient evidence to support an Investigation of the allegation, the process is closed with no further action. The decision to close the Investigation on this basis is appealable for reconsideration to the Investigator or the Title IX Coordinator.
Commence a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation by developing a strategic investigation plan, including a witness list, evidence list, intended investigation timeframe, and order of interviews for all parties and witnesses
Meet with the Complainant to obtain information for a full and final statement, if necessary
Prepare the initial Notice of Investigation and Allegation (NOIA) on the basis of the initial assessment. Notice may be one step or multiple steps, depending on how the investigation unfolds, and potential policy violations may be added or dropped as more is learned. Investigators will update the NOIA accordingly and provide it to the parties.
Notice should inform the parties of their right to have the assistance of an Advisor of their choosing present for all meetings attended by the advisee
When formal notice is given, it should provide the parties with a written description of the alleged violation(s), a list of all policies allegedly violated, a description of the applicable procedures, and a statement of the potential sanctions/remedial actions that could result
Give an instruction to the parties to preserve any evidence that is directly related to the allegations
Provide the parties and witnesses with an opportunity to review and verify the accuracy of Investigator’s summary notes from interviews and meetings with that specific party or witness.
Make good faith efforts to notify the parties of any meeting or interview involving the other party for informational purposes, in advance when possible
Interview all relevant individuals and conduct follow-up interviews as necessary
Allow each party the opportunity to submit questions they wish the Investigator(s) to ask of the other party and witnesses for review and approval of the Title IX Coordinator. The decision of final questions to be presented is made by the Title IX Coordinator in consultation with the Investigator.
Complete the investigation promptly and without unreasonable deviation from the intended timeline
Provide regular status updates to the parties throughout the investigation
Prior to the conclusion of the investigation, summarize for the parties the list of witnesses whose information will be used to determine a finding
Write a comprehensive investigation report fully summarizing the investigation and all evidence
Provide parties with a copy of the draft investigation report when it is completed.
Provide each party with a full and fair opportunity to respond to the report in writing within seven (7) days and incorporate that response into the report
Investigators may choose to respond in writing in the report to the responses of the parties, and/or to share the responses between the parties for their responses, while also ensuring that reasonable limits on opportunities to comment are observed so the Investigation is not unduly delayed.
Share the report with the Title IX Coordinator or legal counsel for review and feedback.
Provide the final report to the Title IX Coordinator that summarizes, assesses, and synthesizes evidence without making a finding, conclusion, determination or recommendation.
Provide the final report to the Title IX Coordinator.
Within five (5) business days of receiving the Investigator’s report, the Chief Accountability Officer will designate a Decision-maker to review the report, any evidence, and all responses, then make the final determination on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence. At the sole discretion of the Chief Accountability Officer, the Investigator’s report may be provided to a team of decision-makers for review and determination.
If the record is incomplete, the Title IX Coordinator/Decision-maker may return the report to the Investigator for re-opening of the investigation, or may direct or conduct any additional inquiry necessary, including meeting with the parties or any witnesses, if needed.
The Title IX Coordinator or Decision-maker may invite and consider impact statements from the parties if and when determining appropriate sanction(s), if any.
The Title IX Coordinator then timely provides the parties with a written Notice of Outcome to include findings, any sanction(s), and a detailed rationale, delivered simultaneously (without undue delay) to the parties.
Witnesses (as distinguished from the parties) who are faculty or staff of UMB are required to cooperate with and participate in UMB’s investigation and resolution process. Failure of a witness to cooperate with and/or participate in the investigation or resolution process constitutes a violation of Policy and may be subject to discipline.
Parties and witnesses may be interviewed remotely by phone, video conferencing, or similar technologies if the Investigator(s) or Decision-maker determine that timeliness or efficiency dictates a need for remote interviewing. Witnesses may also provide written statements in lieu of interviews, or respond to questions in writing, if deemed appropriate by the Investigator(s), though this approach is normally considered not ideal. Where remote technologies are used, UMB makes reasonable efforts to ensure privacy, and that any technology does not work to the detriment of any party or subject them to unfairness.
No unauthorized audio or video recording of any kind is permitted during the resolution process. If Investigator(s) elect to audio and/or video record interviews, all involved parties must be made aware of and consent to audio and/or video recording.
Any evidence that is relevant and credible may be considered, including an individual’s prior misconduct history as well as evidence indicating a pattern of misconduct. The process should exclude irrelevant or immaterial evidence and may disregard evidence lacking in credibility or that is improperly prejudicial.
Unless the Title IX Coordinator determines it is appropriate, the investigation and the finding do not consider: (1) incidents not directly related to the possible violation, unless they evidence a pattern; (2) the sexual history of the parties (though there may be a limited exception made with regard to the sexual history between the parties); or (3) the character of the parties.
While previous conduct violations by the Respondent are not generally admissible as information supporting the current allegation, the Investigator(s) may supply the Title IX Coordinator with information about previous good faith allegations and/or findings, when that information suggests potential pattern and/or predatory conduct. This information will be included in the Investigator’s Report.
Previous disciplinary action of any kind involving the Respondent may be considered in determining the appropriate sanction(s), if UMB uses a progressive discipline system.
Neither the Title IX Coordinator nor the Investigator(s) will meet with character witnesses, but the Investigator(s) may accept up to two (2) letters supporting the character of each of the parties. Such letters must be provided to the Investigator(s) prior to the report being finalized; otherwise, the parties have waived their right to provide such letters. Any impact letters provided to the Investigator will become part of the evidentiary file.
If the Respondent admits to the violation(s), or is found in violation, the Decision-maker, in consultation with other administrators as appropriate, determines sanction(s) and/or remedial actions, which are promptly implemented in order to effectively to stop the harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation; prevent its recurrence; and remedy the effects of the discriminatory conduct, both on the Complainant and the community. This process will include consultation with the appropriate Dean or Conduct Review Board, as applicable.  If the admission occurs prior to referral for Administrative Review, the Chief Accountability Officer will assign a Decision-maker for the purpose of determining the sanction.
The Title IX Coordinator informs the parties of the determination within five (5) business days of the decision, ideally simultaneously, but without significant time delay between notifications. Notifications are made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person; mailed to the local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in official UMB records; or emailed to the parties’ UMB-issued or designated email account. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice is presumptively delivered.
The Notification of Outcome specifies the finding for each alleged policy violation, any sanction(s) that may result which UMB is permitted to share pursuant to state or federal law, and the rationale supporting the essential findings to the extent UMB is permitted to share the information under applicable law.
The notice will detail when the determination is considered final and will detail any changes that are made prior to finalization.
Unless based on an acceptance of violation by the Respondent, the determination may be appealed by either party. The Notification of Outcome also includes the grounds on which the parties may appeal and the steps the parties may take to request an appeal of the findings. More information about the appeal procedures can be found below.
Factors considered when determining any sanction(s)/remedial action(s) may include, but are not limited to:
The nature, severity of, and circumstances surrounding the violation
Previous allegations or allegations involving similar conduct
The need for sanctions/remedial actions to bring an end to the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation
The need for sanctions/remedial actions to prevent the future recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation
The need to remedy the effects of the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation on the Complainant and the community
Any other information deemed relevant by the Decision-maker
In determining sanctions, the process will include consultation with the appropriate Dean or Conduct Review Board, as applicable.  The sanction(s) will be implemented as soon as is feasible. The sanctions described in this policy are not exclusive of, and may be in addition to, other actions taken, or sanctions imposed by outside authorities.
The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:
Warning: A formal statement identifying conduct that was found to be a violation and a warning that further violation of any UMB policy, procedure, or directive will result in more or potentially more severe sanctions/remedial actions.
Probation: A written reprimand for violation of institutional policy, providing for more severe disciplinary sanctions in the event that the student or organization is found in violation of any institutional policy, procedure, or directive within a specified period of time. Terms of the probation will be articulated and may include denial of specified UMB-related social privileges, exclusion from co-curricular activities, exclusion from designated areas of campus, no-contact orders, and/or other measures deemed appropriate.
Suspension: Termination of student status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Students who return from suspension are automatically placed on probation through the remainder of their tenure as a student at UMB.
Dismissal: Permanent termination of student status and revocation of rights to be on campus for any reason or to attend UMB-sponsored events. This sanction will be noted permanently as a Conduct Expulsion on the student’s official transcript.
Required Counseling: A mandate to meet with and engage in either UMB-sponsored or external counseling to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.
Required Training or Education: A mandate to engage in either UMB-sponsored or external training or educational programs to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.
Withholding Degree: UMB may withhold a student’s degree for a specified period of time and/or deny a student participation in commencement activities if the student has an allegation pending or as a sanction if the student is found responsible for an alleged violation.
Revocation of Degree: UMB reserves the right to revoke a degree previously awarded by UMB as a sanction if the student if found responsible for an alleged violation.
Transcript Notation: A permanent notation on the student’s official transcript of the policy violation.
Other Actions: In addition to or in place of the above sanctions, UMB may assign any other sanctions as deemed appropriate.
The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:
Warning – Verbal or Written: A formal verbal or written statement that the conduct was unacceptable and a warning that further violation of any UMB policy, procedure, or directive will result in more severe sanctions/remedial actions.
Performance Improvement Plan: Inclusion of the violation on the employee’s Performance Improvement Plan with corrective actions to be taken by the employee.
Required Counseling: A mandate to meet with and engage in either UMB-sponsored or external counseling to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.

Demotion: Lowering the employee’s status, title, and, if appropriate, pay.
Suspension with pay: Termination of employee’s status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Employees who return from suspension with pay are automatically placed on probation for a period to be determined at the time of suspension. The employee will continue to receive their base salary during the suspension period.
Suspension without pay: Termination of employee’s status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Employees who return from suspension with pay are automatically placed on probation for a period to be determined at the time of suspension. The employee will not receive their salary during the suspension period.
Termination: UMB will end its employment agreement with the employee. The employee will not be eligible to be re-hired by UMB.
Other Actions: In addition to or in place of the above sanctions/remedial actions, UMB may assign any other remedial actions as deemed appropriate.
The UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct provides the potential outcomes should a student withdrawal or resign with charges are pending.
The UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct provides the potential outcomes should an employee resign with charges are pending.
All requests for appeal consideration must be submitted in writing to the Title IX Coordinator within five (5) business days of the delivery of the written finding of the Title IX Coordinator or Decision-maker. Any party may appeal the findings only under the grounds described below.
The President, or the President’s designee, is appointed as the Appeal Decision-maker. Any party may appeal, but appeals are limited to the following grounds:
A procedural error or omission occurred that significantly impacted the outcome of the hearing (e.g., substantiated bias, material deviation from established procedures, failure to correctly apply the evidentiary standard).
To consider new evidence, unknown or could not be made available during the investigation, and that could substantially impact the original finding or sanction. A summary of this new evidence and its potential impact must be included in the appeal.
The Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or Decision-maker(s) had a significant conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent, or a related interest not disclosed that materially affected the outcome of the matter.
When any party requests an appeal, the Title IX Coordinator will share the appeal request with the other party(ies) or other appropriate persons such as the Investigator(s), who may file a response within five (5) business days. The other party may also bring their own appeal on separate grounds.
If new grounds are raised, the original appealing party will be permitted to submit a written response to these new grounds within five (5) business days. These responses or appeal requests will be shared with each party. The Appeal Decision-maker will review the appeal request(s) within seven (7) business days of completing the pre-appeal exchange of materials. If grounds are not sufficient for an appeal, or the appeal is not timely, the appeal will be dismissed.
When the Appeal Decision-maker finds that at least one of the grounds is met by at least one party, additional principles governing the review of appeals include the following:
Decisions by the Appeal Decision-maker are to be deferential to the original decision, making changes to the finding only when there is clear error and to the sanction(s)/remedial action(s) only if there is compelling justification to do so.
Appeals are not intended to be full re-hearings (de novo) of the allegation(s). In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation or record of the investigation and pertinent documentation regarding the grounds for appeal.
An appeal is not an opportunity for the Appeal Decision-maker to substitute their judgment for that of the original Investigator(s) or Title IX Coordinator/Decision-maker merely because they disagree with the finding and/or sanction(s).
Appeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the Investigator(s) for reconsideration. Other appeals should be remanded at the discretion of the Appeal Decision-maker.
Sanctions imposed as the result of Administrative Resolution are implemented immediately unless the Title IX Coordinator stays their implementation in extraordinary circumstances, pending the outcome of the appeal.
For students: Graduation, study abroad, internships/ externships, etc., do NOT in and of themselves constitute exigent circumstances, and students may not be able to participate in those activities during their appeal.
All parties will be informed in writing within (7) business days of the outcome of the appeal without significant time delay between notifications, and in accordance with the standards for Notice of Outcome as defined above.
Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final; further appeals are not permitted, even if a decision or sanction is changed on remand.
In rare cases when a procedural [or substantive] error cannot be cured by the original Investigator(s) and/or Decision-maker (as in cases of bias), the Appeal Decision-maker may recommend a new investigation and/or Administrative Resolution process, including new resolution Decision-maker(s).
In cases in which the appeal results in Respondent’s reinstatement to UMB or resumption of privileges, all reasonable attempts will be made to restore the Respondent to their prior status, recognizing that some opportunities lost may be irreparable in the short term.
Following the conclusion of the resolution process, and in addition to any sanctions implemented, the Title IX Coordinator may implement long-term remedies or actions with respect to the parties and/or the campus community to stop the harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation; remedy its effects; and prevent its reoccurrence.
These remedies/actions may include, but are not limited to:
Permanent alteration of work arrangements for employees
Implementation of long-term contact limitations between the parties
Implementation of adjustments to academic deadlines, course schedules, etc.
At the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, long-term remedies may also be provided to the Complainant even if no policy violation is found.
When no policy violation is found, the Title IX Coordinator will address any remedial requirements that may appropriately be made available by UMB to the Respondent.
13. Failure to Complete Sanctions/Comply with Interim and Long-term Remedies/Remedial Actions
All Respondents are expected to comply with sanctions, remedial actions, and corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the Title IX Coordinator.
Failure to abide by the sanction(s)/action(s) imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanction(s)/remedial/corrective action(s), including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination from UMB and may be noted on a student’s official transcript.
A suspension will only be lifted when compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.
In implementing this policy, records of all allegations, investigations, resolutions, and hearings will be kept for a minimum of seven (7) years, or as required by state or federal law or institutional policy, by the Title IX Coordinator in the Title IX case database.
15. Disabilities Accommodation in the Resolution Process
UMB is committed to providing reasonable accommodations and support to qualified students, employees, or others with disabilities to ensure equal access to the UMB’s resolution process.
Students needing such accommodations or support should complete the Disability and Reasonable Accommodations form located on the Educational Support and Disability Services website located at: https://www.umaryland.edu/disabilityservices/for-students/how-to-request-accommodations/.  Employees should complete the Request for Reasonable Accommodation form and submitting it to Human Resource Services (HRS) Employee Labor Relations (ELR), Office of Diversity, ADA and Affirmative Action located at https://www.umaryland.edu/hrs/current-employees/diversity-ada-aa/americans-with-disabilities-act/. Students and employees seeking accommodations or support should inform the Title IX Coordinator when they have submitted the request(s) to allow for consultation to determine which accommodations are appropriate and necessary for full participation in the process.
These procedures will be reviewed and updated annually by the Title IX Coordinator. UMB reserves the right to make changes to this document as necessary and once those changes are posted online, they are in effect.
The Title IX Coordinator may make minor modifications to these procedures that do not materially jeopardize the fairness owed to any party, such as to accommodate summer schedules.
The Title IX Coordinator may also vary procedures materially with notice (in the Policy and Procedures section of UMB’s Title IX website located at https://www.umaryland.edu/titleix/policies-and-procedures/ , with the appropriate effective date identified) upon determining that changes to law or regulation require policy or procedural alterations not reflected in this procedure.
At the discretion of UMB, Policy in effect at the time of the offense will apply even if the policy is changed subsequently but prior to resolution, unless the parties consent to be bound by the current policy.
If government regulations change in a way that impacts this document, this document will be construed to comply with the most recent government regulations.
This document does not create legally enforceable protections beyond the protection of the background state and federal laws which frame such policies and codes, generally.

UMB Student Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures
Approved by the President, November 6, 1997; Amended October 9, 2012 [nondiscrimination definition, per USM VI 1.05]
Effective July 11, 1997, the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland specifically prohibited discrimination against students on the basis of sexual orientation in academic admissions, financial aid, educational services, housing, student programs and activities and recruitment. Effective June 22, 2012, the Board of Regents prohibited discrimination based upon sexual identity or expression. The Board reserved the right to enforce or comply with any Federal or State law, regulation, or guideline, including conditions for the receipt of federal funding. This University reiterates its commitment to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity by requiring that treatment of its students and applicants for admission be based on individual abilities and qualifications and be free from invidious discrimination.
University students who are also University employees should be aware of the Employee Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Procedures.
Consistent with Board of Regents policy, it is this University's policy that (a) within the University, the educational environment will be free of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and (b) University students are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation against fellow students, University personnel, and other persons with whom the students interact during the course of their educational experiences both on and off campus. Students may be disciplined for violation of this policy.
A student's questions about peer, staff or faculty behavior that may constitute discrimination based on sexual orientation and a student's questions about disciplinary policies should be directed to the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs in the UMB Office of Academic Affairs (“AVPSA”), (410) 706-2477 or, to the campus Director of Employee Relations and Diversity Initiatives, at 410-706-7302, or to the student affairs dean of the student's school.
A complaint of discrimination based on sexual orientation may be made initially to the dean of the complaining student's school, to the appropriate student or school judicial board of the complaining student's school, or to the AVPSA. The AVPSA should be notified of any complaint filed with another office. Investigation of complaints will be made through appropriate school judicial bodies whenever feasible. If a complaint involves persons from more than one school, the AVPSA will work with the deans of the schools involved to develop an appropriate investigational process.
To determine whether alleged conduct constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the University will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances. The determination of whether a particular action is discrimination will be made from all the facts, on a case by case basis.
Timely reporting of allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation is crucial. It permits effective University intervention to protect students and educate and discipline offenders. Incidents of discrimination should be documented promptly and reported as soon as practical. Reporting within the time limits set in a school's judicial policy is strongly encouraged. Reporting an incident of discrimination more than thirty (30) days after it occurs can hinder the ability of the school and institution to investigate the matter. Nevertheless, the school and institution will investigate any complaint filed within a reasonable time.
Institutional investigations of discrimination based on sexual orientation charges often require the complainant's identity to be known by the accused. However, complainants should be aware that the University will not tolerate or condone any form of retaliation against a student complainant whose discrimination claim is made in good faith. Deliberate filing of false accusations may be the basis for independent disciplinary action against the accuser.
Many University students will be supervised by employees of the University's affiliates and teaching sites during their educational experiences. If a student experiences discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in such a setting, the University will attempt to resolve the issue, and will attempt to reassign the student if a resolution is not feasible.
The Counseling Center offers assistance in coping with the stress resulting from discrimination based on sexual orientation or participation in campus proceedings to investigate such discrimination charges. Please call 410-328-8404 for more information about campus counseling services.
Programs for students about discrimination based on sexual orientation can be arranged through the AVPSA, the student affairs dean of each school, or the Director of Employee Relations and Diversity Initiatives.
Definitions Sexual orientation is the identification, perception, or status of an individual as to homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.
Gender identity or expression is defined as a person’s actual or perceived gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression, regardless of whether that identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the person’s gender at birth.

UMB Employee Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures
Approved by President, November 6, 1997; Amended October 9, 2012 [nondiscrimination definition, per USM VI 1.05]
Effective July 11, 1997, the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland specifically prohibited discrimination against faculty and staff on the basis of sexual orientation in recruitment, hiring, employment, appointment, promotion, tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff or termination, rates of pay, selection for training and professional development, and employee services. Effective June 22, 2012, the Board of Regents prohibited discrimination based upon sexual identity or expression. The Board reserved the right to observe the terms of any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, and to enforce or comply with any Federal or State law, regulation, or guideline, including conditions for the receipt of federal funding. This University reiterates its commitment to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity by requiring that treatment of its faculty and staff and applicants for employment be based on individual abilities and qualifications and be free from invidious discrimination.
Faculty and staff who interact with students should be aware of the Student Sexual Orientation NonDiscrimination Procedures.
Consistent with Board of Regents policy, this University will not discriminate against faculty or staff on the basis of sexual orientation in recruitment, hiring, employment, appointment, promotion, tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff or termination, rates of pay, selection for training and professional development, and employee services.
Complaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation by a University employee may be processed internally (a) by classified staff, associate staff and faculty, by reporting the matter to the Executive Director, Human Resource Services, for investigation, mediation, and referral for supervisory action; and/or (b) by classified and associate staff employees, by filing grievances through the University's grievance process; and/or (c) by faculty, by filing grievances with the head of the academic unit in which the complaining faculty member is appointed.
Timely reporting of allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation is crucial and permits effective University intervention. Complaints should be filed within thirty (30) days of an incident perceived as discrimination. Reporting an incident more than thirty (30) days after it occurs can hinder the ability of the University to investigate the matter. Prompt filing of complaints in many cases will enable the University to investigate and attempt to mediate and resolve problems in an expeditious manner. Nevertheless, the University will investigate any and all complaints filed within a reasonable time.
To determine whether alleged conduct constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the University will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances. The determination of whether a particular action is discrimination will be made from all the facts, on a case by case basis.
Investigations of alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation often require the complainant's identity to be known by the party or parties whose conduct is being reviewed. However, the investigation shall be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible with the allegations made available only to those who need to know.
The University will not tolerate or condone any form of retaliation against a complainant whose discrimination claim is made in good faith. Deliberate filing of false accusations may be the basis for independent disciplinary action against the accuser.
Many University employees are obligated to work with, supervise, or be supervised by employees of the University's affiliates and teaching sites (e.g., University of Maryland Medical System Corporation, University Physicians, Inc., faculty professional associations, Veterans' Administration Medical Center). It is the University's policy to attempt to secure for its employees in all settings a work environment free of discrimination based on sexual orientation. University employees are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation against employees of affiliates, and such discrimination may be the basis for disciplinary action.
The University's affiliates will be informed of the University's commitment to its employees to provide a workplace free of discrimination based on sexual orientation and will be asked to work with the University to eliminate such discrimination within their respective workplaces through education and, if need be, employee sanctions. The University cannot discipline employees of its affiliates, but the University will cooperate with its affiliates in an attempt to resolve complaints.
University employees, affiliates, and affiliates' employees are encouraged to report to the University, through Employee Relations and Diversity Initiatives, Human Resource Services, any allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation involving interactions of University employees and employees of affiliates. Employees of affiliates should be aware that their complaints involving University employees should be filed with their own employer as well as with the University. Likewise, University employees should file complaints involving affiliates' employees with the University as well as with the affiliates.
Employees of the University are encouraged to work with the Employee Assistance Program (410-328-5860) or personal counselors to secure assistance in coping with stress that can result from employment-related discrimination based on sexual orientation or from participation in investigation of complaints based on sexual orientation.
Through Human Resource Services, educational programs and preventive consultations with employees can be arranged. More information is available from Employee/Labor Relations and Diversity Initiatives, 410-706-7302.
Definitions Sexual orientation is the identification, perception, or status of an individual as to homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.
Gender identity or expression is defined as a person’s actual or perceived gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression, regardless of whether that identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the person’s gender at birth.

UMB HomeAbout UMBPolicies and ProceduresLibraryHuman ResourcesHuman Resources Policies
UMB-Sponsored Educational Activities Involving Minors Procedures
Purpose The purpose of this Policy is to minimize the risk of conflicts of interest arising from consensual relationships with subordinates or students, promote fairness, and protect all members of the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) community from instances of real or perceived sexual harassment that may result from consensual relationships between UMB personnel and subordinates or students.
SCOPE: This Policy applies to all members of the UMB community (paid and unpaid), including all staff, faculty, students, and trainees.
Policy Statement I. Prohibited Conduct of Persons in Consensual Relationships
A. Supervisors and Subordinates. No member of the UMB community in a leadership, management or supervisory position shall have a consensual romantic, dating, or sexual relationship with a subordinate he or she directly supervises or evaluates, or whose terms or conditions of employment he or she controls directly or indirectly. Terms and conditions of employment include promotion, renewal of appointments or contracts, termination, discipline, compensation, and work assignments.
B. Relationships with Students or Trainees. No member of the UMB community shall have a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship with a student or trainee whom he or she teaches, grades, evaluates, manages, supervises, or advises in any way.
C. Professional Conduct. Consensual relationships must not interfere with any employee's or student’s professionalism. Sexual relations and sexual contact are strictly prohibited in workplace or academic facilities. Individuals in leadership, management, or supervisory positions are expected to conduct themselves with a high standard of professionalism in their workplace and social interactions with subordinates or students.
The University recognizes that some relationships subject to this Policy may already exist, and that others may come into existence in ways that are not the result of a conflict of interest or sexual harassment. For example, reporting relationships may change due to promotions, transfers, school enrollment, graduations, etc. An individual who has a relationship with a member of the UMB community that is addressed by this Policy is required to disclose the relationship in writing to the Chief Accountability Officer (“CAO”) as soon as practical. Upon disclosure of the relationship, the individual may propose an acceptable alternative arrangement for the CAO’s consideration.
“Acceptable alternative arrangement” means an arrangement that removes any supervisory or evaluation responsibilities between the individuals or an individual’s control over the terms and conditions of employment of the subordinate individual involved in the relationship. An acceptable alternative arrangement should avoid negative consequences for the individual in the subordinate role. An individual may request an exception to this Policy from the CAO if an acceptable alternative arrangement is not feasible.
The CAO will consider and may modify a proposal for an acceptable alternative arrangement or grant an exception to this Policy. UMB retains discretion in its enforcement of this Policy and in the approval of acceptable alternative arrangements or exceptions.
Individuals who engage in prohibited consensual relationships (i.e., who do not disclose relationships covered by this Policy to the CAO and do not seek approval of and implement an acceptable alternative arrangement, or secure an exception to this Policy) are in violation of this Policy. Supervisors, including faculty supervisors, who obtain information that would lead a reasonable person to believe that this Policy has been violated, should report the alleged violation to the CAO.
III. Investigation, Corrective Action, and Discipline
A. Alleged violations of this Policy, including concerns of conflicts of interest, will be investigated by the CAO or designee.
B. A relationship covered by this Policy may result in the removal of a management or supervisory employee from his or her position or a reorganization of the reporting or academic relationship so that no conflict of interest exists.
C. Violations of this Policy or failure to adhere to an approved alternative arrangement or conditions of an exception may result in disciplinary action. Disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment, will be considered as warranted by the circumstances and consistent with relevant University policies and procedures.
Decisions made under this Policy will be made based on operational, academic and business considerations and without regard to sex, race, color, religion, creed, age (40 and over), national origin, citizenship, physical or mental disability, military service or application, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, or any other protected characteristic under federal or Maryland law.

Sexual Misconduct, as defined in the UMB Policy Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct and Sex and Gender-Based Discrimination [VI-1.60(A)], is a form of sex-based discrimination that includes Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Harassment, Sexual Intimidation, Sexual Violence, and Stalking. UMB prohibits Sexual Misconduct in any form.
Sexual Harassment, including Sexual Violence, means unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome requests for sexual favors, and other behavior of a sexual nature. Sexual Violence is a form of sexual harassment and means physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person’s will or where a person cannot give consent. Sexual Violence encompasses rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, and sexual coercion.
The following conduct, as well as others that are not listed, can constitute Sexual Harassment/Sexual Violence:
Harassment through public or private insult, sexually suggestive comments concerning a person’s body or behavior, and sexual demands.
Subtle or overt pressure to comply with demands of sexual activity.
Remarks about another person’s clothing, body, sexual activities, sexual preferences, or sexual orientation, as well as teasing, jokes, remarks, or gestures that are sexual in nature.
Unnecessary touching, pinching, patting, or exposure to another person’s body.
Unwanted communications of a sexual nature in writing, by telephone, or by other means.
Requests or demands for sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt threats about grades, clinical assignments, class academic assignments, recommendations, student employment, etc.
Repetition of unwanted invitations for dates.
Physical assault of a sexual nature, up to and including attempted or actual rape.
Dating Violence means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the complainant, based upon the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons in the relationship.
Domestic Violence means violence committed by any of the following persons:
A current or former spouse or intimate partner of the complainant.
A person with whom the complainant shares a child.
A person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the complainant as a spouse or intimate partner.
A person similarly situated to a spouse of the complainant.
Any other person against an adult or youth complainant protected from those acts by domestic or family violence laws of Maryland.
Stalking means engaging in a course of conduct that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress.
If it is a health emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. You also may go to University Police, located at the Pine Street Station, at any time of the day or night to report an incident and receive assistance. University Police must be notified if the Sexual Misconduct involves threatening, aggressive or violent behavior and there is a risk of danger to yourself or others. Reports to University Police can be made in person, by phone, in writing, via email, or by using the University Associate’s Report form, available at:
http://cf.umaryland.edu/umpolicies/usmpolicyInfo.cfm?polid=369&section=all
Regardless of whether a report is made to University Police, you should report any incident of Sexual Misconduct to the University’s Title IX Coordinator as soon as reasonably possible after the incident. The Title IX Coordinator is trained in receiving reports of Sexual Misconduct and will be able to guide you to the appropriate campus support services and assist in eliminating the harassment and preventing recurrence. A list of campus support resources is provided in the UMB Policy Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct and Sex and Gender-Based Discrimination [VI-1.60(A)] as well as the link below:
https://www.umaryland.edu/titleix/resources-and-references/
The Title IX Coordinator, in conjunction with your school or program, will help formulate a plan of interim steps to protect you while a complaint is being investigated. Steps may include:
A change in course or class selection.
University notice to the parties to refrain from contact pending the outcome of the investigation.
Information about campus support services.
Members of the University community are expected to promptly report incidents of Sexual Misconduct involving the University community to the Title IX Coordinator in person, by phone, in writing, via email, or online using the Hotline. A report should be made to the Title IX Coordinator even if you do not have complete information.
If the behavior you observed involved threatening, aggressive, or violent behavior, in addition to notifying the Title IX Coordinator, you also should immediately make a report to University Police.
You can remind the individual that the University has campus support services that are available to the campus community and encourage and assist the individual, as needed, to connect with appropriate support services and to make reports to University Police and the Title IX Coordinator. Even if the individual does not wish to make a formal report or pursue an inquiry, you are expected to promptly report the allegation of Sexual Misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator. Reports to the Title IX Coordinator can be made in person, by phone, in writing, via email, or online using the Hotline. Reports should be made even if you do not have complete information and even if the individual requests confidentiality.
You may request partial or complete confidentiality; however, a request for confidentiality may limit the University’s ability to respond. The University will take reasonable steps to investigate and respond to a complaint consistent with a request for confidentiality as long as doing so does not prevent the University from responding effectively to a hostile environment and preventing hostile behavior that may be directed toward others.
Even if you do not wish to identify yourself or pursue an investigation, you should make a report to the Title IX Coordinator, who will provide you with information about the campus support services available to you and work with you and your school on steps to eliminate the harassment and prevent recurrence. You may make an anonymous report, but this might limit the University’s ability to respond to the complaint.
You always may contact the police about filing a criminal complaint. Regardless of whether the hostile behavior is part of a criminal investigation or proceeding, the University will conduct its own investigation and take reasonable steps to end the misconduct and prevent recurrences.
Yes. Incidents of Sexual Misconduct involving a member of the campus community that occur off campus should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator. Behavior that is threatening, aggressive, or violent should be reported to law enforcement in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred, as well as to UMB Police. The University will investigate and take reasonable steps to resolve such complaints to the extent necessary to protect the complainant and prevent harassment directed toward others.
If you have been accused of Sexual Misconduct, be aware that University policy does not presume an accused individual is responsible for the alleged conduct. The University will investigate and take reasonable steps to end the misconduct and prevent recurrences. The complainant and the respondent have equal opportunity to due process.
The University offers many campus support services. A list of campus resources is available in the  UMB Policy Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct and Sex and Gender-Based Discrimination [VI-1.60(A)] and at http://www.umaryland.edu/titleix/resources-and-references/.
If you have any questions or need guidance regarding campus resources, contact the University’s Title IX Coordinator.
The University’s Behavioral Evaluation and Threat Assessment (BETA) Team coordinates activities in response to reports of threatening, aggressive, or violent behavior or warning signs of such behavior. Warning signs are described in the UMB Behavioral Evaluation and Threat Assessment Policy [XI-3.00(A)] available at https://www.umaryland.edu/policies-and-procedures/library/public-safety/policies/xi-300a.php.
The BETA Team can be reached through a report to University Police. If an incident of Sexual Misconduct involves threatening, aggressive, or violent behavior and you believe there is risk of continuing or recurrent danger to members of the University community, immediately report the matter to University Police in person, by phone, via email, or by using the University Associate’s Report form, available at the above-referenced BETA policy link.
Reports of Sexual Misconduct, regardless of whether or not reported to University Police and the BETA Team, also should be made to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator may consult with the BETA Team if a report of Sexual Misconduct presents a risk of danger to the individual making the report or others.
The University does not tolerate or condone any form of retaliation against an individual whose report or complaint is made in good faith or against any person who participates in good faith in an inquiry or investigation of a complaint under the applicable University policies and procedures.
Harassment Prevention for Employees provides an overview of the types of behaviors that can give rise to harassment claims, including those based on gender, race, color, national origin, religion, age, and disability, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (and ADA Amendments Act), and the University's nondiscrimination policies and procedures.
The Title IX for Higher Education course provides an overview of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that prohibits sexual harassment of members of the University community. Compliance with this law is required for all educational institutions (kindergarten through higher education). The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has indicated that failure to comply with Title IX can have serious repercussions for institutions, including loss of federal funding, and has sanctioned schools nationwide for failing to meet the standards under Title IX. Sexual assault also is a form of sexual discrimination prohibited under Title IX. More information about Title IX at UMB can be found in the University's sexual misconduct policies and procedures.
All UMB employees must take both the Harassment Prevention and Title IX training courses. This includes anyone on the UMB payroll, such as graduate students, postdocs, hourly, and student workers.
All members of the UMB community, including affiliates and students, must take the Title IX training course.
Currently, residents who are employed through University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) and any employees of Faculty Physicians Inc. (FPI) can use the same course as UMB Affiliates.
Before accessing the Learning Hub, or beginning a course in the eLearning system, please disable your pop-up blocker.
If you continue to have trouble, email eLearning@umaryland.edu with a detailed description of your issue (description of screen, error message, etc.).
Human Resource Services (HRS) and OAC will maintain tracking information and provide reports to supervisors, as requested.
If a supervisor would like to verify completion by their employees, OAC prints completion reports at the end of each month and can provide the last available report upon request. Supervisors should encourage their employees to sign in to eLearning. The online training has been assigned to all employees as part of their eLearning profile. Reminders will be sent directly from the Learning Hub to any employee who has signed into eLearning connection but has not completed the training.
UMB must maintain continuous compliance with Title IX requirements. Therefore, this training must be completed every academic year.
OAC has been meeting with schools and departments since April 2013 regarding Title IX training and the upcoming all-staff electronic training. In 2013, OAC presented in-person Title IX training at the deans and vice presidents meeting, at the law school’s faculty council meeting, and at the all-employee/staff meetings for the schools of nursing, social work, and pharmacy, and for URecFit. In 2014, OAC presented Title IX training to employees of the counseling center and student health.
Title IX training is required by the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) for all employees. Given the large number of UMB employees, online training is the best method to reach the majority of the University community.
The Learning Hub system requires the username and password that employees use to enter their timesheets. OAC understands that some employees do not complete timesheets through myUMB and are unfamiliar with the portal and mechanism for logging in. Please contact eLearning@umaryland.edu to address any access concerns.
Supervisors should communicate this message to any staff without UMB email addresses in the same way other communications are sent to those staff members. OAC can provide informational flyers for any units that may have this issue. Please contact TitleIXCompliance@umaryland.edu.
The Department of Education can withhold federal funding from any institution that doesn’t comply with Title IX. Since 2001, the Department of Education has issued guidance to schools with steps to follow in order to comply with Title IX; one such step is Title IX training for all employees.
Every UMB employee must take this training. While the intention is not to single out individual employees, the failure of any one UMB employee/department/lab/unit to comply means the University, as a whole, could lose federal funding. UMB employees who fail to timely complete required training may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Again, it is highly recommended that employees access the eLearning system well in advance of the annual deadline to ensure that any issues or concerns will be resolved well ahead of the deadline.
Supervisors should help lead the push for compliance by their employees. Ensuring employees complete mandatory training is a metric upon which a supervisor may be evaluated as part of informal and formal performance evaluations.
Your online training information is stored for UMB’s records — you do not need to send confirmation of completion to OAC.
If you would like to save or print proof of completion for your own records, the certificate of completion becomes available at the end of the training. You can print or save the certificate from that new window.

UMB HomeAbout UMBPolicies and ProceduresLibraryAdministrationAdministration Policies
Approved by the President March 30, 2015, replaced V1-1.30(A), to comply with USM V1-1.60 (eff. June 27, 2014, revised June 19, 2015); Revised August 26, 2015; Revised August 14, 2020; Revised March 24, 2023 to update links.
University of Maryland, Baltimore (“UMB” or “Institution”) is committed to providing a learning and working environment free from Sexual Misconduct, as defined in Section III of this Policy.  UMB prohibits and will not tolerate Sexual Misconduct. Sexual Misconduct is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by state and federal laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 as amended (“Title IX”) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and some forms of Sexual Misconduct may constitute criminal activity. UMB endeavors to foster a climate free from Sexual Misconduct through training, education, prevention programs, and policies and procedures that promote prompt reporting, prohibit retaliation, and promote timely, fair, and impartial investigation and resolution of Sexual Misconduct cases in a manner that eliminates the Sexual Misconduct, prevents its reoccurrence, and addresses its effects.
All students, faculty, and staff, as well as third parties and contractors under UMB control, are subject to this Policy regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This Policy applies to Sexual Misconduct in connection with any UMB educational program or activity, including Sexual Misconduct (1) in any UMB facility or on any UMB property; (2) in connection with any UMB sponsored, recognized or approved program, visit, or activity, regardless of location and inclusive of the online environment; (3) that impedes equal access to any UMB educational program or activity or adversely effects the employment of a member of the UMB community; or (4) that otherwise threatens the health or safety of a member of the UMB community. Nothing in this Policy is intended to supersede or conflict with any federal compliance obligation.
Federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) require that UMB implement certain procedures when UMB obtains Actual Knowledge of Sexual Harassment in its Education Programs or Activities against a person in the United States. UMB will address all allegations to determine whether the conduct occurred in the context of its employment or educational program or activity and/or has continuing effects on the campus or in an off-campus UMB program or activity, violating UMB policy. Prohibited Sexual Misconduct that violates UMB policy that does not fall under the scope of Title IX either because it occurs outside the United States or because it does not fall within Title IX’s definition of Sexual Harassment will be addressed using alternate processes as more fully described in UMB’s procedures.
If the Respondent is unknown or is not a member of the UMB community, the Title IX Coordinator will assist the Complainant (and the reporting party if someone other than the alleged victim has reported the Sexual Misconduct) in identifying appropriate campus and local resources and support options. UMB may take other actions as appropriate, such as barring a third party from UMB property and/or events. When the Respondent is enrolled in or employed by another USM institution, the Title IX Coordinator can assist in liaising with the appropriate individual for that institution and, in some instances, may make a report to the institution, as the alleged conduct may be prohibited by that school’s policies. Similarly, the Title IX Coordinator may be able to provide support to a student or employee who reports discrimination in an externship, study abroad program, or other environment external to UMB.
In Maryland, a person under the age of 16 years cannot consent to sexual activity. This means that sexual contact by an individual over the age of 18 with a person younger than 16 years old may be a crime, could require an immediate report to the applicable child welfare agency and/or local law enforcement agency, and represents a potential violation of this Policy, even if the minor appeared to welcome the sexual activity. See UMB’s Procedures for Reporting Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect (VI-1.50(A)) for mandatory requirements for Sexual Misconduct that includes a minor.
This Policy is not meant to inhibit or prohibit educational content or discussions inside or outside of the classroom that include controversial or sensitive subject matters protected by academic freedom.
UMB encourages those who are unsure whether a situation is controlled by this Policy to ask questions and seek advice through the Title IX Office or the Consultation Line, available at https://www.umaryland.edu/oac/consult-with-us/.
UMB will have actual knowledge that a violation of this Policy may have occurred when notice of the alleged violation is given to an Official with Authority to take corrective action. A report to the Title IX Coordinator or designee or received through UMB’s Hotline is sufficient to provide UMB with actual knowledge.
Advisor means a person chosen by a party or appointed by the institution to accompany the party to meetings related to the resolution process, to advise the party on that process, and to conduct cross-examination for the party at the hearing, if any.
An individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that is in violation of this Policy.
Employees of UMB who, in relation to the services being provided on behalf of the institution, have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential. A list of these individuals is listed in Section VI.C.4.
A knowing, voluntary, and affirmatively communicated willingness to mutually participate in a particular sexual activity or behavior.  Consent must be given by a person with the ability and capacity to exercise free will and make a rational and reasonable judgment. Consent may be expressed either by affirmative words or actions, as long as those words or actions create a mutually understandable permission regarding the conditions of sexual activity. Consent may be withdrawn at any time. Consent cannot be obtained by force, threat, coercion, fraud, manipulation, reasonable fear of injury, intimidation, or by using one’s mental or physical helplessness or incapacity. Consent cannot be implied based on the mere fact of a previous consensual dating or sexual relationship. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another.
If a person is incapacitated, which is to be deprived of their capacity or natural power, they are not able to make rational decisions and, therefore, cannot consent to sexual activity. Incapacity will be evaluated using a reasonable person standard, e.g., would a reasonable person believe the person is/was unable to consent.  Incapacitation can be caused by the consumption of alcohol, but a person who is “drunk” or intoxicated” may or may not be incapacitated; incapacitation can also be the result of being drugged, unconscious, sleep-deprived and/or ill.
Violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the Complainant’s statement, with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
A felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred; or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Maryland or the jurisdiction in which the crime or violence occurred.
Includes locations, events, or circumstances over which UMB has or does exercise substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by UMB.
Removal of a party from UMB’s program or activity on an emergency basis, provided UMB has undertaken an individualized safety and risk analysis, determined that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual harassment justifies removal, and provided the respondent with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.
A document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment by a Respondent and requesting that UMB investigate the allegation of sexual harassment. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator.
Decision-maker refers to the individual(s) who have decision-making and sanctioning authority within UMB’s formal grievance process.
Investigator means the person or persons charged by UMB with gathering facts about an alleged violation of this Policy, synthesizing the evidence, and compiling this information into an investigation report.
Employees of UMB who do not have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential as listed in Section VI.C.4.
Any official of UMB with authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the institution.
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature by a person having power or authority over another and submission to such sexual conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual’s work or educational development or performance, or evaluation thereof.
Intimidating, threatening, coercing, or discriminating against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, USM or UMB policy relating to Sexual Misconduct, or because an individual has made a report, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to Sexual Misconduct. Retaliation includes retaliatory harassment.
The unfair, unfavorable, or inequitable treatment of a person based on their biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation.
An offense classified as a forcible or nonforcible sex offense, which as of 2018 have been combined in the single category “sex offenses,” under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is defined as:

The use of unreasonable pressure to compel another individual to initiate or continue sexual activity against the individual’s will. A person’s words or conduct are sufficient to constitute coercion if they wrongfully impair another individual’s freedom of will and ability to choose whether to engage in sexual activity. Coercion includes but is not limited to intimidation, manipulation, threats of emotional or physical harm, and blackmail. Examples of coercion include threatening to disclose another individual’s private sexual information, or threatening to harm oneself if the other party does not engage in the sexual activity.

Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the Complainant or the Respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipient’s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment.
UMB’s Title IX Coordinator oversees and coordinates UMB’s compliance with all aspects of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, all associated regulations promulgated under Title IX, and this Policy. The Title IX Coordinator is housed in the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC):
Stephanie Suerty, MPA, CCEPActing Title IX CoordinatorDirector, Special Projects Office of Accountability & Compliance 410-706-5212 titleixcompliance@umaryland.edu
The Title IX Coordinator acts to ensure that all UMB representatives involved in the investigation, resolution, and disciplinary processes act with objectivity and impartiality. Where the Title IX Coordinator determines that a UMB representative poses a conflict of interest or bias, the Title IX Coordinator shall recuse that person(s) from the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes. Concerns of bias or a potential conflict of interest by any other administrator involved in the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes should be raised with the Title IX Coordinator.
The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for receiving complaints or reports of conduct that could constitute sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managing the Title IX Program, including the informal and formal grievance processes, and ensuring effective implementation of any remedies determined through UMB’s grievance process.
Reports of misconduct or discrimination committed by the Title IX Coordinator, or concerns regarding potential bias or conflict of interest by the Title IX Coordinator, should be made to UMB’s Chief Accountability Officer and Vice President, Dr. Susan Buskirk; or through the UMB Hotline.
UMB adheres to all federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination in public institutions of higher education. Specifically, Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in UMB programs and activities.
UMB does not discriminate, or tolerate discrimination, against any employee, applicant for employment, student, or applicant for admission on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.  Sex and Gender-based Discrimination is prohibited.
This Policy includes Sex and Gender-based Discrimination in both employment and access to educational opportunities, and access to services and programs provided by UMB.  Therefore, any member of the UMB community who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational or employment access and/or opportunities of any member of the UMB community, guest, or visitor on the basis of sex or gender in violation of federal and state laws and regulations is in violation of this Policy. UMB's prohibitions on discrimination extend to its admissions and hiring processes. UMB will take steps to eliminate prohibited conduct, prevent its reoccurrence, and remedy its effects.
UMB does not tolerate Sexual Misconduct of or by any employee, affiliate, volunteer, student, visitor, contractor, or guest. UMB will act to remedy all forms of Sexual Misconduct.
UMB reserves the right to address offensive conduct and/or harassment not prohibited by this Policy, for example, harassment that does not rise to the level of creating a hostile environment, or is of a generic nature not based on sex or gender. Such conduct may be referred for alternative review and resolution by the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC) to other departments as appropriate, including to Human Resources Services (HRS) for human resource related violations and to Deans or their designees for student code of conduct violations.
Any person may report Sexual Harassment (whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment).
All UMB Non-Confidential Employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct which they believe may be a violation of this Policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority.  Failure of a Non-Confidential Employee to report an incident or incidents of Sexual Misconduct of which they become aware is a violation of this Policy and the violator could be subject to disciplinary action.
No employee (other than UMB Police) is authorized to investigate or resolve reports of prohibited conduct without the involvement of the Title IX Coordinator.
All UMB students are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.
Third Parties (e.g., contractors, visitors, etc.) are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.
1. UMB is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of information of all individuals involved in a Sexual Misconduct matter.  Privacy and confidentiality have distinct meanings under this Policy.
Privacy generally means that information related to a report of Sexual Misconduct will be shared only with those UMB employees with a “need to know” the information in order to assist in the review, investigation, or resolution of the report.  Although not bound by confidentiality, these employees will make every effort to protect the privacy interests of all individuals, consistent with due process requirements and the need for a thorough review.
Confidentiality means that the information shared with professionals who have been designated by UMB as confidential resources cannot be revealed to any other person without the express permission of the individual who shared the information with the professional.  These designated professionals are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.
An individual who wishes to discuss a Sexual Misconduct matter confidentially may do so by speaking with a professional who has a legal duty to maintain confidentiality.  Confidential resources for UMB students and employees are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.  Information shared with these resources will not be shared with anyone without the individual’s express permission, unless maintaining such confidentiality would result in imminent physical harm to the individual or other individuals.  When a report involves suspected abuse of a minor, applicable laws and UMB policies require reporting to child protective services and/or local law enforcement.
If a Complainant or other reporting party does want their name to be shared, does not want an investigation to take place, or does not want a formal resolution to be pursued, they may make such a request to the Title IX Coordinator, who will evaluate the request along with various considerations, including risks to members of the UMB community and legal requirements. UMB will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with a request for privacy or a request not to pursue an investigation.  Where UMB is unable to take action consistent with the request of the Complainant or reporting party, the Title IX Coordinator will inform them about UMB’s chosen course of action.
If a report of Sexual Misconduct discloses a serious or continuing threat to the UMB community, UMB may issue a campus-wide timely warning to protect the health or safety of the UMB community. The timely warning will not include identifying information about the reporting party.
Reports of Sexual Misconduct may be made to UMB using any of the following options:

The above resources will maintain confidentiality except in cases involving a threat of imminent physical injury, or abuse of a minor or vulnerable adult. Confidential employees who are also designated as Campus Security Authorities will submit timely anonymous, aggregate statistical information for Clery Act purposes.
Campus counselors and the Employee Assistance Program are available to help free of charge and can be seen on an emergency basis during regular business hours.

Mercy Medical Center is the designated treatment center for sexual assault and domestic violence in Baltimore City where victims of sexual assault (aged 13 and older) may obtain a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE), including Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits.   A police report is not required in order to obtain an exam, which can be conducted up to five (5) days after an assault. Medical attention is recommended even if more than five (5) days have passed since the assault occurred.
Mercy Medical Center Emergency Room345 St. Paul PlaceBaltimore, Maryland 21202410-332-9494https://bmoresafemercy.org/for-patients/
UMB Title IX personnel are available to promptly assist anyone experiencing sex- or gender-based violence, including sexual assault, in obtaining medical attention, including providing transportation to the nearest designated SAFE hospital.
Information on Maryland SAFE programs located outside Baltimore City is included in Section XIV. Resources, below.
UMB encourages the reporting of Sexual Misconduct by victims and witnesses.  Sometimes, victims or witnesses are hesitant to report misconduct or participate in resolution processes because they fear that they themselves may be accused of policy violations.  It is in the best interest of the UMB community for victims and witnesses to report misconduct.  To encourage reporting, UMB offers amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.
If the behavior was a violation of the drug or alcohol policy, and UMB is not required by law to intervene or report, UMB will offer amnesty if the violation occurred reasonably during or near the time of the alleged Sexual Misconduct, the person reported or is cooperating with UMB’s investigation in good faith, and the behavior did not put another individual’s health or safety at risk.
UMB encourages community members to assist victims during or after an incident when it is safe to do so, and offers training in bystander intervention.  For students who offer help to others in need, UMB pursues a policy of amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.
Upon receipt by the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority of an allegation or notice of an alleged violation of the Policy, UMB initiates its resolution process, which involves a prompt preliminary review to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe this Policy has been violated.
The Title IX Coordinator will initiate communication with the Complainant to offer Supportive Measures and determine if the Complainant wishes to file a Formal Complaint.  Upon receipt of a Formal Complaint, the parties will be provided with written notice of the allegations, UMB’s grievance process, including formal and informal resolution processes, the right of an Advisor of the party’s choice, and UMB’s policies regarding knowingly making false statements or submitting false information.
UMB will investigate allegations in a Formal Complaint.  Any allegations that do not constitute an allegation of Sexual Harassment as defined in Section III.W, did not occur in UMB’s education program or activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, will be dismissed for purposes of a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment under Title IX; such a dismissal does not preclude UMB from taking action under this Policy, UMB’s Code of Ethics and Conduct or other relevant policies.
UMB’s investigatory process assumes the responsibility to ensure that the burden of proof and the burden of gathering sufficient evidence to reach a determination is borne by UMB. During the investigation process, the parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses, including fact and expert witness, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.  Neither party will be restricted from discussing the allegations or gathering and presenting relevant evidence.
To the extent allegations fall within the scope of Title IX, at the conclusion of the investigation, adjudication of the allegations will occur through a live hearing.  During the hearing, as more fully described in the Procedures, each party, through their Advisor, will have the opportunity to question and cross-examine the other party and any witnesses.  Live hearings may be conducted with the parties located in separate rooms/locations with technology enabling the decision-maker(s), panelists, and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. For parties that do not have an advisor, UMB will provide an Advisor of its choice, who may or may not be an attorney, for the purposes of conducting such questioning and cross-examination. An audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of the live hearing will be made available to the parties for inspection and review.  A Determination will be made by the Decision-maker and a written Determination report will be provided to the parties simultaneously.
To the extent allegations fall partially within the scope of Title IX and partially within the scope of other policies, UMB may bifurcate matters.
The parties may appeal a Determination, or any dismissal of a Formal Complaint, on the following grounds:
New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal of the Formal Complaint was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; and
The Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.
In order to make a determination of whether or not a policy violation occurred, UMB uses the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, that is, whether it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred.
The investigation and subsequent resolution processes determine whether the Policy has been violated. If it is determined that a policy violation occurred, UMB will promptly implement effective remedies designed to end the discrimination, prevent its reoccurrence, and address its effects.
Upon the freely given consent of both parties, an informal resolution process may be chosen in lieu of the formal process of investigation and adjudication.  For those parties that agree to an Informal Process, UMB will provide a written notice of the allegation, the requirements for participation in the Informal Resolution process, the right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution process at any time before a resolution is agreed upon, and the potential consequences that may result from participating in the Informal Resolution process. Where there is an allegation of Sexual Misconduct committed by an employee against a student, the Informal Resolution process will not be offered as an option.
UMB prohibits the use of mediation to resolve policy violations where the Sexual Misconduct includes stalking, sexual assault, or sexual coercion.
Complainants and Respondents may have an advisor of their choice attend with them all meetings and interviews within the resolution process, if they so choose.
Where a matter falls within the scope of Title IX such that a live hearing is required, Complainants and Respondents must have an advisor when a formal process is initiated and these advisors will be responsible for questioning witnesses during the live hearing of the grievance process. Each party may select whomever they wish for this role if the person(s) is eligible and available, i.e., is not a party or witness in the process and is not a minor. Examples of advisors include a licensed attorney, an advocate who is supervised by a licensed attorney, or a trained advocate. In addition, as necessary, a translator will be made available upon request of a party.
The advisor may attend meetings or interviews with the party.  The advisor must attend any hearings and will be required to conduct any cross-examination on behalf of the party they are advising.  The advisor may offer private consultations with the party during hearings, meetings, and interviews, except during questioning of the party.  Parties may request, through the Title IX Coordinator, to have more than one Advisor.  The decision to grant this request is at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and will be granted equitably to all parties.
A current or former UMB student who makes a complaint or who responds to a complaint on which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and who was enrolled as a student at UMB at the time of the incident that is the basis of the complaint may obtain legal counsel through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (the “Commission”). The Commission has developed a list of attorneys and legal services programs willing to represent students on a pro bono basis or at reduced fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. The student may select an attorney on the Commission’s list or seek an alternate attorney to whom the Commission will pay reasonable fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs.  Any fees above and beyond those paid under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation are the responsibility of the student. The Commission will not pay attorney’s fees for representation of a student in any criminal or civil matter or any administrative matter that is not a Title IX proceeding at an institution operating in Maryland. See https://mhec.maryland.gov/Pages/Title-IX-Campus-Sexual-Assault-Proceedings.aspx.
UMB will make a good faith effort to complete the resolution process, including any appeal, within a sixty (60) calendar day time period, which can be extended as necessary by the Title IX Coordinator, with notice to the parties.
UMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to weeks) and resolution process if circumstances require. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the need for language assistance, the absence of parties and/or witnesses, and/or accommodation for disabilities or health conditions. UMB will communicate in writing the anticipated duration of the delay and reason to the parties and provide the parties with status updates if necessary. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process as soon as feasible. During such a delay, UMB will implement Supportive Measures as deemed appropriate. Institutional action(s) are not precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.
Students: Should a student decide not to participate in the process, the process will proceed to an appropriate resolution.
Should a student Respondent permanently withdraw from the Institution, the process will end, as the Institution no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former student. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that have contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct. The student who withdraws or leaves while the process is pending may not return to UMB and a hold will be placed on their ability to be readmitted. If the student withdraws or takes leave for a specified period of time (e.g., one semester or term), the process will continue and that student will not be permitted to return to UMB unless and until the process is concluded and, where applicable, any sanctions have been satisfied. During the process, UMB may put a hold on a Respondent’s transcript or place a note on a Respondent’s transcript or dean’s disciplinary certification that a disciplinary matter is pending.
Employees: Should an employee Respondent resign from employment with unresolved allegations pending, the resolution process ends, as UMB no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former employee. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct.
Individuals involved in reported Sexual Misconduct may be entitled to Supportive Measures.  In some instances, Supportive Measures such as no-contact orders, may extend beyond the conclusion of informal or formal resolution of a complaint.  Supportive Measures are not sanctions.
notification of the appropriate administrative authorities regarding possible absences from employment or academic program
arrangements for alternative academic, living, or employment situations, if such alternative is available and feasible
modifications to work or class schedules, building access points, parking lot assignments, and other similar logistics, including increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus
development of a mutual no-contact order (or a no-trespass order against a non-affiliated third party)
Any request(s) for Supportive Measures should be made to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact the appropriate UMB personnel to coordinate and implement Supportive Measures.
Sanctions may be imposed upon any member of the UMB community determined to have violated this Policy. The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:
UMB considers Sexual Assault to be the most serious sexual misconduct.  Respondents found responsible for Sexual Assault violations typically receive the most severe sanctions, including suspension or dismissal for students and termination for employees. However, UMB reserves the right to impose any level of sanction, ranging from a reprimand up to and including suspension or expulsion/termination, for any act of Sexual Misconduct, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
The Hearing Decision-maker or Panel reserves the right to deviate from the range of recommended sanctions in the case of serious mitigating circumstances or egregiously offensive conduct. Neither the initial hearing officers nor any appeals body or officer will deviate from the range of recommended sanctions unless compelling justification exists to do so.
Respondents are expected to comply with all assigned sanctions, responsive actions, and corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the Decision-maker and/or Title IX Coordinator. Failure to abide by the sanctions/actions imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanctions/actions, including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination, and may be noted on a student’s official transcript or in an employee’s official record. A suspension will be lifted only after compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.
Retaliation is any adverse action taken because of a person’s participation in a protected activity. Protected activities include reporting an incident that may implicate this Policy, participating in the resolution process (as a party or witness), supporting a reporting party, Complainant or Respondent, or assisting in providing information relevant to an investigation. Protected activities also include opposing Sexual Misconduct, refusing to participate in wrongful or unlawful activities or refusing to carry out a directive that would include engaging in or hiding wrongful or unlawful activities.   Adverse actions are negative professional or educational actions, that would not otherwise have been taken, to deter an individual from engaging in, or in retaliation against an individual for participating in, protected activities.  Adverse actions are actions that would dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in the complaint process (either as a party or non-party witness).
Acts of alleged retaliation should be reported immediately using the UMB Hotline and will be promptly investigated as a potential separate violation of this Policy. UMB is prepared to take appropriate steps to prevent retaliation.
Records of all allegations, investigations, formal and informal resolutions, and hearings will be kept for at least seven (7) years by the Title IX Coordinator. The Institution will also retain records of the training provided to Title IX Coordinators, investigators, and decision-makers.
Annually, UMB community members are expected to participate in training that addresses Title IX rights, responsibilities, and obligations, raises awareness regarding Sexual Misconduct, and seeks to prevent its occurrence. Information on mandatory training will be provided through the Title IX website.
Training for Students: UMB provides mandatory student training at the beginning of each academic year.
Training for Employees: UMB provides mandatory employee training upon hire and at the beginning of each academic year. Additional mandatory training may be required based on the employee’s role within UMB.
Additionally, University Recreation and Fitness (URecFit), in collaboration with University Police, offers Rape Aggression Defense Training (RAD) on techniques for prevention and defense.
Requests for additional training can be made through the Office of Accountability and Compliance, at www.umaryland.edu/oac.

Approved by the President March 30, 2015, replaced V1-1.30(A), to comply with USM V1-1.60 (eff. June 27, 2014, revised June 19, 2015); Revised August 26, 2015; Revised August 14, 2020; Revised March 24, 2023 to update links.
University of Maryland, Baltimore (“UMB” or “Institution”) is committed to providing a learning and working environment free from Sexual Misconduct, as defined in Section III of this Policy.  UMB prohibits and will not tolerate Sexual Misconduct. Sexual Misconduct is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by state and federal laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 as amended (“Title IX”) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and some forms of Sexual Misconduct may constitute criminal activity. UMB endeavors to foster a climate free from Sexual Misconduct through training, education, prevention programs, and policies and procedures that promote prompt reporting, prohibit retaliation, and promote timely, fair, and impartial investigation and resolution of Sexual Misconduct cases in a manner that eliminates the Sexual Misconduct, prevents its reoccurrence, and addresses its effects.
All students, faculty, and staff, as well as third parties and contractors under UMB control, are subject to this Policy regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This Policy applies to Sexual Misconduct in connection with any UMB educational program or activity, including Sexual Misconduct (1) in any UMB facility or on any UMB property; (2) in connection with any UMB sponsored, recognized or approved program, visit, or activity, regardless of location and inclusive of the online environment; (3) that impedes equal access to any UMB educational program or activity or adversely effects the employment of a member of the UMB community; or (4) that otherwise threatens the health or safety of a member of the UMB community. Nothing in this Policy is intended to supersede or conflict with any federal compliance obligation.
Federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) require that UMB implement certain procedures when UMB obtains Actual Knowledge of Sexual Harassment in its Education Programs or Activities against a person in the United States. UMB will address all allegations to determine whether the conduct occurred in the context of its employment or educational program or activity and/or has continuing effects on the campus or in an off-campus UMB program or activity, violating UMB policy. Prohibited Sexual Misconduct that violates UMB policy that does not fall under the scope of Title IX either because it occurs outside the United States or because it does not fall within Title IX’s definition of Sexual Harassment will be addressed using alternate processes as more fully described in UMB’s procedures.
If the Respondent is unknown or is not a member of the UMB community, the Title IX Coordinator will assist the Complainant (and the reporting party if someone other than the alleged victim has reported the Sexual Misconduct) in identifying appropriate campus and local resources and support options. UMB may take other actions as appropriate, such as barring a third party from UMB property and/or events. When the Respondent is enrolled in or employed by another USM institution, the Title IX Coordinator can assist in liaising with the appropriate individual for that institution and, in some instances, may make a report to the institution, as the alleged conduct may be prohibited by that school’s policies. Similarly, the Title IX Coordinator may be able to provide support to a student or employee who reports discrimination in an externship, study abroad program, or other environment external to UMB.
In Maryland, a person under the age of 16 years cannot consent to sexual activity. This means that sexual contact by an individual over the age of 18 with a person younger than 16 years old may be a crime, could require an immediate report to the applicable child welfare agency and/or local law enforcement agency, and represents a potential violation of this Policy, even if the minor appeared to welcome the sexual activity. See UMB’s Procedures for Reporting Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect (VI-1.50(A)) for mandatory requirements for Sexual Misconduct that includes a minor.
This Policy is not meant to inhibit or prohibit educational content or discussions inside or outside of the classroom that include controversial or sensitive subject matters protected by academic freedom.
UMB encourages those who are unsure whether a situation is controlled by this Policy to ask questions and seek advice through the Title IX Office or the Consultation Line, available at https://www.umaryland.edu/oac/consult-with-us/.
UMB will have actual knowledge that a violation of this Policy may have occurred when notice of the alleged violation is given to an Official with Authority to take corrective action. A report to the Title IX Coordinator or designee or received through UMB’s Hotline is sufficient to provide UMB with actual knowledge.
Advisor means a person chosen by a party or appointed by the institution to accompany the party to meetings related to the resolution process, to advise the party on that process, and to conduct cross-examination for the party at the hearing, if any.
An individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that is in violation of this Policy.
Employees of UMB who, in relation to the services being provided on behalf of the institution, have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential. A list of these individuals is listed in Section VI.C.4.
A knowing, voluntary, and affirmatively communicated willingness to mutually participate in a particular sexual activity or behavior.  Consent must be given by a person with the ability and capacity to exercise free will and make a rational and reasonable judgment. Consent may be expressed either by affirmative words or actions, as long as those words or actions create a mutually understandable permission regarding the conditions of sexual activity. Consent may be withdrawn at any time. Consent cannot be obtained by force, threat, coercion, fraud, manipulation, reasonable fear of injury, intimidation, or by using one’s mental or physical helplessness or incapacity. Consent cannot be implied based on the mere fact of a previous consensual dating or sexual relationship. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another.
If a person is incapacitated, which is to be deprived of their capacity or natural power, they are not able to make rational decisions and, therefore, cannot consent to sexual activity. Incapacity will be evaluated using a reasonable person standard, e.g., would a reasonable person believe the person is/was unable to consent.  Incapacitation can be caused by the consumption of alcohol, but a person who is “drunk” or intoxicated” may or may not be incapacitated; incapacitation can also be the result of being drugged, unconscious, sleep-deprived and/or ill.
Violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the Complainant’s statement, with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
A felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred; or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Maryland or the jurisdiction in which the crime or violence occurred.
Includes locations, events, or circumstances over which UMB has or does exercise substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by UMB.
Removal of a party from UMB’s program or activity on an emergency basis, provided UMB has undertaken an individualized safety and risk analysis, determined that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual harassment justifies removal, and provided the respondent with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.
A document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment by a Respondent and requesting that UMB investigate the allegation of sexual harassment. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator.
Decision-maker refers to the individual(s) who have decision-making and sanctioning authority within UMB’s formal grievance process.

Intimidating, threatening, coercing, or discriminating against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, USM or UMB policy relating to Sexual Misconduct, or because an individual has made a report, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to Sexual Misconduct. Retaliation includes retaliatory harassment.

The use of unreasonable pressure to compel another individual to initiate or continue sexual activity against the individual’s will. A person’s words or conduct are sufficient to constitute coercion if they wrongfully impair another individual’s freedom of will and ability to choose whether to engage in sexual activity.

Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipient’s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment.
UMB’s Title IX Coordinator oversees and coordinates UMB’s compliance with all aspects of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, all associated regulations promulgated under Title IX, and this Policy. The Title IX Coordinator is housed in the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC):
Stephanie Suerty, MPA, CCEPActing Title IX CoordinatorDirector, Special Projects Office of Accountability & Compliance 410-706-5212 titleixcompliance@umaryland.edu
The Title IX Coordinator acts to ensure that all UMB representatives involved in the investigation, resolution, and disciplinary processes act with objectivity and impartiality. Where the Title IX Coordinator determines that a UMB representative poses a conflict of interest or bias, the Title IX Coordinator shall recuse that person(s) from the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes. Concerns of bias or a potential conflict of interest by any other administrator involved in the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes should be raised with the Title IX Coordinator.
The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for receiving complaints or reports of conduct that could constitute sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managing the Title IX Program, including the informal and formal grievance processes, and ensuring effective implementation of any remedies determined through UMB’s grievance process.
Reports of misconduct or discrimination committed by the Title IX Coordinator, or concerns regarding potential bias or conflict of interest by the Title IX Coordinator, should be made to UMB’s Chief Accountability Officer and Vice President, Dr. Susan Buskirk; or through the UMB Hotline.
UMB adheres to all federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination in public institutions of higher education. Specifically, Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in UMB programs and activities.
UMB does not discriminate, or tolerate discrimination, against any employee, applicant for employment, student, or applicant for admission on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.  Sex and Gender-based Discrimination is prohibited.
This Policy includes Sex and Gender-based Discrimination in both employment and access to educational opportunities, and access to services and programs provided by UMB.  Therefore, any member of the UMB community who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational or employment access and/or opportunities of any member of the UMB community, guest, or visitor on the basis of sex or gender in violation of federal and state laws and regulations is in violation of this Policy. UMB's prohibitions on discrimination extend to its admissions and hiring processes. UMB will take steps to eliminate prohibited conduct, prevent its reoccurrence, and remedy its effects.
UMB does not tolerate Sexual Misconduct of or by any employee, affiliate, volunteer, student, visitor, contractor, or guest. UMB will act to remedy all forms of Sexual Misconduct.
UMB reserves the right to address offensive conduct and/or harassment not prohibited by this Policy, for example, harassment that does not rise to the level of creating a hostile environment, or is of a generic nature not based on sex or gender. Such conduct may be referred for alternative review and resolution by the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC) to other departments as appropriate, including to Human Resources Services (HRS) for human resource related violations and to Deans or their designees for student code of conduct violations.
Any person may report Sexual Harassment (whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment).
All UMB Non-Confidential Employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct which they believe may be a violation of this Policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority.  Failure of a Non-Confidential Employee to report an incident or incidents of Sexual Misconduct of which they become aware is a violation of this Policy and the violator could be subject to disciplinary action.
No employee (other than UMB Police) is authorized to investigate or resolve reports of prohibited conduct without the involvement of the Title IX Coordinator.
All UMB students are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.
Third Parties (e.g., contractors, visitors, etc.) are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.
1. UMB is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of information of all individuals involved in a Sexual Misconduct matter.  Privacy and confidentiality have distinct meanings under this Policy.
Privacy generally means that information related to a report of Sexual Misconduct will be shared only with those UMB employees with a “need to know” the information in order to assist in the review, investigation, or resolution of the report.  Although not bound by confidentiality, these employees will make every effort to protect the privacy interests of all individuals, consistent with due process requirements and the need for a thorough review.
Confidentiality means that the information shared with professionals who have been designated by UMB as confidential resources cannot be revealed to any other person without the express permission of the individual who shared the information with the professional.  These designated professionals are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.
An individual who wishes to discuss a Sexual Misconduct matter confidentially may do so by speaking with a professional who has a legal duty to maintain confidentiality.  Confidential resources for UMB students and employees are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.  Information shared with these resources will not be shared with anyone without the individual’s express permission, unless maintaining such confidentiality would result in imminent physical harm to the individual or other individuals.  When a report involves suspected abuse of a minor, applicable laws and UMB policies require reporting to child protective services and/or local law enforcement.
If a Complainant or other reporting party does want their name to be shared, does not want an investigation to take place, or does not want a formal resolution to be pursued, they may make such a request to the Title IX Coordinator, who will evaluate the request along with various considerations, including risks to members of the UMB community and legal requirements. UMB will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with a request for privacy or a request not to pursue an investigation.  Where UMB is unable to take action consistent with the request of the Complainant or reporting party, the Title IX Coordinator will inform them about UMB’s chosen course of action.
If a report of Sexual Misconduct discloses a serious or continuing threat to the UMB community, UMB may issue a campus-wide timely warning to protect the health or safety of the UMB community. The timely warning will not include identifying information about the reporting party.
Reports of Sexual Misconduct may be made to UMB using any of the following options:

Mercy Medical Center is the designated treatment center for sexual assault and domestic violence in Baltimore City where victims of sexual assault (aged 13 and older) may obtain a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE), including Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits.   A police report is not required in order to obtain an exam, which can be conducted up to five (5) days after an assault. Medical attention is recommended even if more than five (5) days have passed since the assault occurred.
Mercy Medical Center Emergency Room345 St. Paul PlaceBaltimore, Maryland 21202410-332-9494https://bmoresafemercy.org/for-patients/
UMB Title IX personnel are available to promptly assist anyone experiencing sex- or gender-based violence, including sexual assault, in obtaining medical attention, including providing transportation to the nearest designated SAFE hospital.
Information on Maryland SAFE programs located outside Baltimore City is included in Section XIV. Resources, below.
UMB encourages the reporting of Sexual Misconduct by victims and witnesses.  Sometimes, victims or witnesses are hesitant to report misconduct or participate in resolution processes because they fear that they themselves may be accused of policy violations.  It is in the best interest of the UMB community for victims and witnesses to report misconduct.  To encourage reporting, UMB offers amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.
If the behavior was a violation of the drug or alcohol policy, and UMB is not required by law to intervene or report, UMB will offer amnesty if the violation occurred reasonably during or near the time of the alleged Sexual Misconduct, the person reported or is cooperating with UMB’s investigation in good faith, and the behavior did not put another individual’s health or safety at risk.
UMB encourages community members to assist victims during or after an incident when it is safe to do so, and offers training in bystander intervention.  For students who offer help to others in need, UMB pursues a policy of amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.
Upon receipt by the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority of an allegation or notice of an alleged violation of the Policy, UMB initiates its resolution process, which involves a prompt preliminary review to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe this Policy has been violated.
The Title IX Coordinator will initiate communication with the Complainant to offer Supportive Measures and determine if the Complainant wishes to file a Formal Complaint.  Upon receipt of a Formal Complaint, the parties will be provided with written notice of the allegations, UMB’s grievance process, including formal and informal resolution processes, the right of an Advisor of the party’s choice, and UMB’s policies regarding knowingly making false statements or submitting false information.
UMB will investigate allegations in a Formal Complaint.  Any allegations that do not constitute an allegation of Sexual Harassment as defined in Section III.W, did not occur in UMB’s education program or activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, will be dismissed for purposes of a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment under Title IX; such a dismissal does not preclude UMB from taking action under this Policy, UMB’s Code of Ethics and Conduct or other relevant policies.
UMB’s investigatory process assumes the responsibility to ensure that the burden of proof and the burden of gathering sufficient evidence to reach a determination is borne by UMB. During the investigation process, the parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses, including fact and expert witness, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.  Neither party will be restricted from discussing the allegations or gathering and presenting relevant evidence.
To the extent allegations fall within the scope of Title IX, at the conclusion of the investigation, adjudication of the allegations will occur through a live hearing.  During the hearing, as more fully described in the Procedures, each party, through their Advisor, will have the opportunity to question and cross-examine the other party and any witnesses.  Live hearings may be conducted with the parties located in separate rooms/locations with technology enabling the decision-maker(s), panelists, and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. For parties that do not have an advisor, UMB will provide an Advisor of its choice, who may or may not be an attorney, for the purposes of conducting such questioning and cross-examination. An audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of the live hearing will be made available to the parties for inspection and review.  A Determination will be made by the Decision-maker and a written Determination report will be provided to the parties simultaneously.
To the extent allegations fall partially within the scope of Title IX and partially within the scope of other policies, UMB may bifurcate matters.
The parties may appeal a Determination, or any dismissal of a Formal Complaint, on the following grounds:
New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal of the Formal Complaint was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; and
The Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.
In order to make a determination of whether or not a policy violation occurred, UMB uses the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, that is, whether it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred.
The investigation and subsequent resolution processes determine whether the Policy has been violated. If it is determined that a policy violation occurred, UMB will promptly implement effective remedies designed to end the discrimination, prevent its reoccurrence, and address its effects.
Upon the freely given consent of both parties, an informal resolution process may be chosen in lieu of the formal process of investigation and adjudication.  For those parties that agree to an Informal Process, UMB will provide a written notice of the allegation, the requirements for participation in the Informal Resolution process, the right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution process at any time before a resolution is agreed upon, and the potential consequences that may result from participating in the Informal Resolution process. Where there is an allegation of Sexual Misconduct committed by an employee against a student, the Informal Resolution process will not be offered as an option.
UMB prohibits the use of mediation to resolve policy violations where the Sexual Misconduct includes stalking, sexual assault, or sexual coercion.
Complainants and Respondents may have an advisor of their choice attend with them all meetings and interviews within the resolution process, if they so choose.
Where a matter falls within the scope of Title IX such that a live hearing is required, Complainants and Respondents must have an advisor when a formal process is initiated and these advisors will be responsible for questioning witnesses during the live hearing of the grievance process. Each party may select whomever they wish for this role if the person(s) is eligible and available, i.e., is not a party or witness in the process and is not a minor. Examples of advisors include a licensed attorney, an advocate who is supervised by a licensed attorney, or a trained advocate. In addition, as necessary, a translator will be made available upon request of a party.
The advisor may attend meetings or interviews with the party.  The advisor must attend any hearings and will be required to conduct any cross-examination on behalf of the party they are advising.  The advisor may offer private consultations with the party during hearings, meetings, and interviews, except during questioning of the party.  Parties may request, through the Title IX Coordinator, to have more than one Advisor.  The decision to grant this request is at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and will be granted equitably to all parties.
A current or former UMB student who makes a complaint or who responds to a complaint on which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and who was enrolled as a student at UMB at the time of the incident that is the basis of the complaint may obtain legal counsel through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (the “Commission”). The Commission has developed a list of attorneys and legal services programs willing to represent students on a pro bono basis or at reduced fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. The student may select an attorney on the Commission’s list or seek an alternate attorney to whom the Commission will pay reasonable fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs.  Any fees above and beyond those paid under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation are the responsibility of the student. The Commission will not pay attorney’s fees for representation of a student in any criminal or civil matter or any administrative matter that is not a Title IX proceeding at an institution operating in Maryland.

UMB will make a good faith effort to complete the resolution process, including any appeal, within a sixty (60) calendar day time period, which can be extended as necessary by the Title IX Coordinator, with notice to the parties.
UMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to weeks) and resolution process if circumstances require. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the need for language assistance, the absence of parties and/or witnesses, and/or accommodation for disabilities or health conditions. UMB will communicate in writing the anticipated duration of the delay and reason to the parties and provide the parties with status updates if necessary. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process as soon as feasible. During such a delay, UMB will implement Supportive Measures as deemed appropriate. Institutional action(s) are not precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.
Students: Should a student decide not to participate in the process, the process will proceed to an appropriate resolution.
Should a student Respondent permanently withdraw from the Institution, the process will end, as the Institution no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former student. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that have contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct. The student who withdraws or leaves while the process is pending may not return to UMB and a hold will be placed on their ability to be readmitted. If the student withdraws or takes leave for a specified period of time (e.g., one semester or term), the process will continue and that student will not be permitted to return to UMB unless and until the process is concluded and, where applicable, any sanctions have been satisfied. During the process, UMB may put a hold on a Respondent’s transcript or place a note on a Respondent’s transcript or dean’s disciplinary certification that a disciplinary matter is pending.
Employees: Should an employee Respondent resign from employment with unresolved allegations pending, the resolution process ends, as UMB no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former employee. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct.
Individuals involved in reported Sexual Misconduct may be entitled to Supportive Measures.  In some instances, Supportive Measures such as no-contact orders, may extend beyond the conclusion of informal or formal resolution of a complaint.  Supportive Measures are not sanctions.
notification of the appropriate administrative authorities regarding possible absences from employment or academic program
arrangements for alternative academic, living, or employment situations, if such alternative is available and feasible
modifications to work or class schedules, building access points, parking lot assignments, and other similar logistics, including increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus
development of a mutual no-contact order (or a no-trespass order against a non-affiliated third party)
Any request(s) for Supportive Measures should be made to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact the appropriate UMB personnel to coordinate and implement Supportive Measures.
Sanctions may be imposed upon any member of the UMB community determined to have violated this Policy. The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:
UMB considers Sexual Assault to be the most serious sexual misconduct.  Respondents found responsible for Sexual Assault violations typically receive the most severe sanctions, including suspension or dismissal for students and termination for employees. However, UMB reserves the right to impose any level of sanction, ranging from a reprimand up to and including suspension or expulsion/termination, for any act of Sexual Misconduct, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
The Hearing Decision-maker or Panel reserves the right to deviate from the range of recommended sanctions in the case of serious mitigating circumstances or egregiously offensive conduct. Neither the initial hearing officers nor any appeals body or officer will deviate from the range of recommended sanctions unless compelling justification exists to do so.
Respondents are expected to comply with all assigned sanctions, responsive actions, and corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the Decision-maker and/or Title IX Coordinator. Failure to abide by the sanctions/actions imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanctions/actions, including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination, and may be noted on a student’s official transcript or in an employee’s official record. A suspension will be lifted only after compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.
Retaliation is any adverse action taken because of a person’s participation in a protected activity. Protected activities include reporting an incident that may implicate this Policy, participating in the resolution process (as a party or witness), supporting a reporting party, Complainant or Respondent, or assisting in providing information relevant to an investigation. Protected activities also include opposing Sexual Misconduct, refusing to participate in wrongful or unlawful activities or refusing to carry out a directive that would include engaging in or hiding wrongful or unlawful activities.   Adverse actions are negative professional or educational actions, that would not otherwise have been taken, to deter an individual from engaging in, or in retaliation against an individual for participating in, protected activities.  Adverse actions are actions that would dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in the complaint process (either as a party or non-party witness).
Acts of alleged retaliation should be reported immediately using the UMB Hotline and will be promptly investigated as a potential separate violation of this Policy. UMB is prepared to take appropriate steps to prevent retaliation.
Records of all allegations, investigations, formal and informal resolutions, and hearings will be kept for at least seven (7) years by the Title IX Coordinator. The Institution will also retain records of the training provided to Title IX Coordinators, investigators, and decision-makers.
Annually, UMB community members are expected to participate in training that addresses Title IX rights, responsibilities, and obligations, raises awareness regarding Sexual Misconduct, and seeks to prevent its occurrence. Information on mandatory training will be provided through the Title IX website.
Training for Students: UMB provides mandatory student training at the beginning of each academic year.
Training for Employees: UMB provides mandatory employee training upon hire and at the beginning of each academic year. Additional mandatory training may be required based on the employee’s role within UMB.
Additionally, University Recreation and Fitness (URecFit), in collaboration with University Police, offers Rape Aggression Defense Training (RAD) on techniques for prevention and defense.

A message from Dr. Roger J. Ward, the University's Chief Accountability Officer
Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
Thank you for helping to make our campus a harassment-free environment.

Substantiated - means supported by proof or evidence.
