If you don’t have a website, you will have to make hard copies of materials available for inspection. ATIXA will not be providing hardcopies of any items on this page.
Materials are posted from January 1st, 2018 to the present. The materials included are those you received from ATIXA in your registrant site when you registered for your certification training.
You are not required to post trainings prior to August 14th, 2020, but we have placed two years of prior trainings on this site for you.
Training materials are listed below by type of certification or training and by year but not by location.
ATIXA cannot vouch that any materials on this site were seen by any particular trainee, and ATIXA has not verified the registration or attendance of any individual for any particular training.
Certification from ATIXA refers to attendance at a qualifying event; ATIXA cannot speak to individual attendees’ knowledge, expertise, or command of the material. Each attendee is responsible for the learning outcomes of any training.
There is nothing that would stop someone from copying a link from this site and claiming training they have attended. As such, ATIXA makes no guarantees as to representation or posting of its content with respect to any level of understanding, competence, comprehension, or even attendance of any individual.
The materials posted below are the aggregate of all trainings provided by ATIXA. They are not broken down by each individual training ATIXA has provided.
All post-August 14th, 2020 ATIXA certification registrants should come back to this page to obtain their publicly posted training materials. Do not take any links from the Lobby or a Course Material page to post.
Members and trainees, please understand that any member of the public can access these materials, and some will be searching for evidence that you have received training that is biased or biasing. While ATIXA materials are neutral, encourage impartiality (or multi-partiality), and a fair evaluation of all evidence, you should be careful about taking trainings from organizations that are biased or that have political agendas. Also, be careful about some trauma-informed training organizations whose content is not well-grounded in empirical scientific research or data.
If you would like to request a transcript of the events that you have attended please send an email to transcripts@requests.atixa.org with the subject line “My Transcript”. A copy of your transcript will be emailed to you automatically.
If you would like to request the transcript for someone else, please send an email to transcripts@requests.atixa.org with the subject line the email address of the person who’s transcript you would like to request. Please allow up to 1 business day for these requests to be processed.
We used an item not listed to create our forms, policies, and procedures; how do I post this?
You don’t. These are not trainings, or training materials and therefore not expected to post them. You do not have permission from ATIXA to post these copyrighted materials.
Why do you only have 2018 items to present on this page?
ATIXA determined that materials older than that would not address current regulations-based training requirements. Certifications older than two-years are no longer in good standing with ATIXA.
How quickly do I need to post the training materials once I take a training?
The regulations do not specify, they only state that all trainings must be posted.
I want to post the actual video recording (where applicable), how do I do this?
The regulations did not specify that recordings be posted, only training materials. Thus, ATIXA has provided training materials, and does not grant permission for the posting of any recordings at this time.
ATIXA has posted generic slide sets for the most part, as a training content does not vary substantially from training to training.
I want to list every training I have ever taken with ATIXA, can you provide this to me?
Training materials are only required to be posted for the time period starting August 14, 2020 and forward. There is no requirement to post trainings taken prior to this date. However, as there are people within their 2-year ATIXA Certification time-period, we have provided everything from 2018 to present.
How do I know which supplemental materials to post for my Certification Course?
You can post the applicable materials that were contained on your Course Materials/Lobby page that was provided to you at the time of training.
To publicly post ATIXA materials on your site, you have these options, only:
Copy the URL for this entire page (https://atixa.org/2020-regulations-requirement-posting-of-training-materials/) and post it to your institutional or organizational website.
Copy the link to any particular item/training below that you or your Title IX team members attended, and post that link(s) to your website. In order to copy the correct link, please LEFT click on the page icon next to the material(s) you want to copy. If you copy the blue URL, the link will expire after two weeks.
If you don’t have a website, you will have to make hard copies of these materials available for inspection. ATIXA will not be providing hardcopies of any items on this page.
Again, the above pathways are the only methods permitted. You are not authorized to post ATIXA materials publicly in any other way.

Texas Launches Lawsuit Against Biden’s Unlawful Title IX Guidance Forcing “Transgender” Policies in Schools by Threatening Education Funds
The Office of the Attorney General has filed a lawsuit challenging the Biden Administration’s unlawful interpretation of Title IX, exposing the Department of Education’s new guidance as an illegal effort to force schools to adopt “transgender” ideology in schools or risk losing federal education funds. This is Texas’s 50th lawsuit against the Biden Administration.
Title IX is a federal statute that prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex” in educational institutions. Under Biden, the Department of Education has issued guidance arbitrarily expanding this category to include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” The guidance risks federal education funding for Texas colleges and universities as well as all Texas K-12 schools receiving any amount of federal funding by unlawfully asserting that these conceptions promoted by the extremist transgender movement are covered by Title IX protections.
Examples purported by the Biden Administration to be violations of Title IX include teachers failing to forcibly compel students to use classmates’ so-called “preferred pronouns,” schools’ policies enforcing separate bathroom facilities for biological males and females, and schools’ policies refusing to allow biological males to compete on female sports teams. Under this doctrine, Texas schools would be investigated by the federal government for following Texas law, including Chapter 33 of the Education Code protecting the integrity of school athletics participation on the basis of biological sex.
Texas is challenging this blatant attempt to misuse federal regulatory power to force K-12 schools, colleges, and universities in our state to accept and implement “transgender” ideology—in violation of state law—by misusing the Title IX statute to threaten the withholding of federal education funds. The Administration’s unlawful guidance could put at risk over $6 billion in federal funding that supports Texas K-12 and higher education institutions.

Pax­ton and Nor­mangee ISD Announce Set­tle­ment with UBS to Com­pen­sate School Dis­trict Over State Pro-Ener­gy Law
Attorney General Paxton and Normangee Independent School District (“Normangee ISD”) announced a settlement with UBS in the amount of $850,000. The settlement resulted from the company’s inability to underwrite Normangee ISD’s bonds under the terms of a Texas law known as “SB 13,” which stipulates the terms on which certain companies can do business with state governmental entities.
“UBS’s actions in this case were costly, and it is critical that they compensate Normangee ISD to recover losses. That’s exactly what this settlement accomplishes,” said Attorney General Paxton. “I remain committed to combatting the corporate ESG investment agenda, shielding taxpayers from the extra costs that come with it by shifting the burden to banks, and protecting Texas energy companies.”
SB 13 requires financial companies who contract with Texas governments to certify that they do not boycott energy companies. UBS certified that it does not boycott energy companies when it entered into a contract to underwrite $18.6 million in bonds to be issued by Normangee ISD.
But the Texas Comptroller placed UBS and several other financial services firms on a list of energy boycotters in August 2022, and the Attorney General’s Public Finance Division concurred in that determination, thus disapproving the underwriting contract with Normangee ISD. Through no fault of its own, Normangee ISD then had to re-bid the contract at a higher interest rate, causing it financial harm. Attorney General Paxton then negotiated the settlement with UBS on Normangee ISD’s behalf.

Pax­ton Empha­sizes Title IX Legal Pro­tec­tions for Female Athletes
Attorney General Paxton joined an amicus brief to protect women’s sports from unfair and dangerous competition from biological men.
The Tennessee-led brief, filed in the New York City-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, highlights the protections for biological women under Title IX. For decades, Title IX has helped create opportunities for girls to participate in sports by prohibiting educational programs from discriminating on the basis of sex.
Despite recent attempts to radically alter the definition of “sex,” Title IX has long operated under the biological reality that there are two separate sexes: male and female. Given this fact, allowing subjective “gender identity” to trump biological sex would render much of Title IX unworkable.
Relying on a definition of “sex” that is entirely subjective allows biological men to compete against biological women, oftentimes hampering a key protection under Title IX, which is the “chance to be champions.” The brief describes recent events in Connecticut, highlighting instances in which biological boys were able to win a large number of track-and-field competitions when competing against women, limiting the athletic experience for biological girls.
The amicus brief states: “Providing girls the opportunity to experience the thrill of victory was one of the main athletic purposes of Title IX. At the time of Title IX’s enactment, the public understood that allowing biological boys to compete against girls would result in boys taking away championship opportunities designated for girls. In this circumstance, Defendants have failed to ‘effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes’ by refusing to offer truly sex-separated track-and-field competitions for the two sexes.”
