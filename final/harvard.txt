Harvard College's Title IX Resource Coordinators work with undergraduate students impacted in any way by sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct – including sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking – to navigate resources, learn about options, and access supportive measures
College Title IX aims to promote a Harvard College free of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct, to educate our community about policy and Title IX compliance, and help impacted students make the most informed decisions possible about their safety and well-being.
Title IX Resource Coordinators partner with students to help you:
College Title IX can be a starting point for College students who have been impacted in any way by sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, or gender-based harassment.
Title IX Resource Coordinators treat information shared with them with the utmost privacy.
Title IX Resource Coordinators share information only a need-to-know basis.
Speaking with a Title IX Resource Coordinator does not automatically trigger an investigation or formal complaint.
Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
Have a question or need to talk to a Title IX Resource Coordinator?

“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.
Title IX regulations guide how colleges and universities, including Harvard, must respond to sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct through appropriate grievance procedures, supportive measures, and related policies. At Harvard, our policies and procedures not only follow the requirements of Title IX regulations, but expand beyond them to also address behaviors that we deem inappropriate for members of the Harvard community.

Title IX Resource Coordinators have specialized experience in responding to disclosures of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. They serve in a neutral role, support all members of the Harvard community, and are expert resources around the University’s policies, procedures, and resources in the realm of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. Resource Coordinators serve as the primary point of contact for individuals seeking supportive measures, individualized supports that enable Harvard community members impacted by sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct to access their work or studies.
Contacting your local Title IX Resource Coordinator is not the same as filing a formal complaint with the University Title IX Coordinator. Rather, the Resource Coordinators are a resource to help you make an informed decision about which pathways are right for you.

What is Title IX? Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance from the Department of Education, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.

The Departmentï¿½s Title IX Liaison was created to help students, staff, faculty, and all in our community deal with any issues concerning sexual and gender-based discrimination, including sexual violence.ï¿½ The current Title IX Liaisons areï¿½ Professors Yuhua Wang and Mashail Malik.
Anyone in the Department can reach out to one of the Liaisons to report misconduct and seek help. The Liaison serves as a neutral point of contact supporting individuals in response to concerns regarding sexual and gender harassment.ï¿½ Here, we are committed to creating an environment of psychological safety, so that people who have experienced or know of instances of sexual harassment are comfortable reporting it.
Itï¿½s important to know that the Liaison is not the sole point of contact for dealing with Title IX issues; it is just one of many options Harvard provides for dealing with these issues. People should feel free to approach anyone inside or outside the Department with whom they feel comfortable sharing their concerns about discrimination, health, and work issues.ï¿½ They do not have to go through the Department of Government Liaison.
Feel free to contact Liaison Prof. Yuhua Wang yuhuawang@fas.harvard.edu or visit his office at CGIS Knafel Bldg., K 214. Or Liaison Prof. Mashail Malik by mashailmalik@fas.harvard.edu or visit her office at CGIS Knafel Bldg., K208.
Liaisons must disclose all known details about potential incidents of harassment.
Under Harvardï¿½s Title IX, all faculty, staff, and grad students are Responsible Employees while employed by Harvard. As a Responsible Employee, the Liaison then must share with a Title IX Coordinator all known details (ï¿½a disclosureï¿½) about potential incidents of sexual or gender-based harassment. However, before revealing details to the Liaison, an individual has the option of working with others,ï¿½on and/or off campus, who can provide varying degrees of confidentiality (e.g. lawyers, doctors, mental health clinicians, clergy, ombuds). The individual can decide whether or not to disclose a potential incident to the Liaison.
Please note that sharing a concern with a Title IX Liaison is not the same as filing a formal complaint; filing a formal complaint is a separate process handled by the Office for Dispute Resolution.ï¿½ Rather, the Liaison is resource to help you make an informed decision about which pathways are right for you. The Title IX Liaison can also arrangeï¿½interimï¿½measures (supports that help members of the Harvard community continue with their studies and work and to participate in campus life) and may facilitateï¿½informalï¿½resolutions, as appropriate, between the involved parties, with a goal of memorializing a mutually acceptable resolution in writing.

Law and Justice. Learning how to create a more equitable society.
Overview: The curricular program in Law and Justice allows Government students to look at the intersection of law and politics and learn how political and legal institutions can interact to promote or impede the creation of a just society. It is particularly well-suited for students who plan to go to law school and would like to use their time at Harvard College to complement their future study of legal doctrine with normative and empirical investigations of the social institution of law. Coursework in the program spans all four subfields of political science (political theory, American politics, comparative politics, and international relations), and students are encouraged to pursue their own research on an empirical or normative topic related to law and justice through the Government Departmentï¿½s senior thesis program.
Requirements: Four courses out of the ten courses required for the concentration, chosen from the list below. ï¿½No more than one of the courses can be taken at the Harvard Kennedy School. All four courses for the program must be taken for a letter grade.

Nafees graduated magna cum laude in Government in 2010. She attended Yale Law School, where she was Co-Chair of the Moot Court Board, student government representative,ï¿½Yale Law and Policy Reviewï¿½Notesï¿½Editor, and teaching fellow for four Yale College courses. She is currently an Associate at Boies, Schiller, & Flexner in New York City and a Visiting Fellow at Yale Law Schoolï¿½s Information Society Project. Her research interests include information privacy and civil liberties.
At Harvard, Nafees wrote forï¿½The Harvardï¿½Crimsonï¿½and interned both for the British Parliament and the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Immediately after her graduation, she served as a congressional staffer for the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee under Chairman John Conyers. There, she worked on BP oil spill legal issues and constitutional matters with the FBI. On behalf of the committee, she helped to successfully impeach Judge Thomas Porteous, Jr. at trial. Nafees also advised Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson on foreign policy, veteransï¿½ affairs, and womenï¿½s issues.
As a writer, Nafees has reached millions of readers and spoken to several media outlets on legal issues and current events (CNN, Foreign Policy, The International Journal of the History of Sport, andï¿½The Huffington Post.) Clickï¿½hereï¿½toï¿½read her June 2018 op-ed in theï¿½New York Times.ï¿½More recently, she has spoken at Columbia Law School on a panel on Faith and the Law and at Princeton University on Literary Arts.
Hannah Mullen is a student at Harvard Law School, where she is an editor of theï¿½Harvard Law Review.ï¿½ She has worked as a summer intern at the Department of Justice and as a summer associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson.ï¿½ She is especially interested in appellate and constitutional law.ï¿½ After graduating from law school, Hannah will clerk for Chief Judge Merrick Garland on the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit.ï¿½ She graduated from Harvard College in 2015 with a Degree in Government.
One of the things that I appreciated the most about the Government Department at Harvard and my degree in general was the amazing staff that were so supportive of my interests that intersected with my focus on International Relations. Whether it was letting me count my Anthropology of Violence and Conflict class towards my degree requirements, helping me figure which classes to take my junior fall to prepare for my study abroad tutorials at Oxford University, or creating more small group section times in the early morning or evening to accommodate my rugby training schedule, the people in the Government Department truly made me feel valued and heard, despite how large our degree class was. As a first-generation college student, being supported by the teaching fellows, the professors and the staff of the Government Department was critical to my undergraduate success. After graduating in 2013, I moved from Cambridge, MA to New York City. This was a pretty big shift for me, as I was the first person in my family to live outside of Massachusetts. I became a trial preparation assistant and then was promoted to investigative analyst in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau in the New York County District Attorneyï¿½s Office. Though my main focus as an undergraduate was international conflict, the skills I learned from my Government classes played a large role in my job. The careful analysis of numerical data, being able to take a complex narrative and translate it into something accessible, and being highly organized helped me to excel in my role at the District Attorneyï¿½s Office. More importantly, the small group sophomore tutorial laid the groundwork for the interpersonal skills necessary to work as part of a prosecution team. I worked in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau for three years before applying to law school. I am currently a rising 2L at Boston University School of Law. This past summer I was a federal judicial intern in the Honorable Judge Ann Donnelly in the Eastern District of New York, as well as a part time research assistant for Professor Rossman and Clinical Professor Mann. My two research projects were on the history of misdemeanor courts in early America and the intersection of procedural due process and Title XI. Now that the compulsory first year curriculum has passed I am getting back into my academic passion of international relations, as well as writing an international-based ï¿½noteï¿½ as a 2L editor for the Public Interest Law Journal. (I guess I had to write a ï¿½thesisï¿½ at some point!) My tentative topic is a comparative note on domestic violence jurisprudence in the US and the UK. I would encourage all Harvard undergraduates to take at least one Government class. Regardless of the subfield, a class in Government will teach you to develop a critical eye for history and politics, and enable you to participate in the great debates that capture our collective attention. We all need more informed citizens in this world and thereï¿½s no better place to start than here.

Purpose: The purpose of this meeting space is to bring together faculty/staff who support fellow Harvard community members affected by interpersonal violence and want to improve their own care practices.
About: This intentional gathering will take a deep dive into Part One of the book, Trauma Stewardship: An Everyday Guide to Caring for Self While Caring for Others, by Laura van Dernoot Lipsky and Connie Burk. This text will provide a framework to refine and expand self-care strategies of employees who bear witness to the traumatic experiences of others. This is a drop-in meeting space on secure zoom where participants are encouraged to attend as many of the meetings as their schedule allows: September 28, October 19, November 16, and December 21 at 3:00-4:15 p.m. See hollis.harvard.edu for the e-book version of Trauma Stewardship.
For more information or if you plan to attend the meetings, please contact SHARE at oge_share@harvard.edu.
Purpose: The purpose of this group is to practice slowing down and learning new embodiment tools through yoga with community. This will include regulating the nervous system, attuning to personal needs, and learning breathwork and meditation skills.
About: The Restorative Yoga Group will meet to practice yoga (physical movement, breathwork, and meditation) and learn how to integrate yoga practices into your daily life. These classes will be taught from a South-Asian perspective that honors the lineage and origins of yoga and explore how we can use these tools to support personal and collective healing.
You do not need to have any prior yoga experience to join. If you have any questions or concerns about this, we are happy to talk through them with you. These classes will be open to individuals who have experienced power-based interpersonal violence, and we ask that you register in advance.

Title IX Resource Coordinators have specialized experience in responding to disclosures of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. They serve in a neutral role, support all members of the Harvard community, and are expert resources around the Universityï¿½s policies, procedures, and resources in the realm of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. Resource Coordinators serve as the primary point of contact for individuals seeking supportive measures, individualized supports that enable Harvard community members impacted by sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct to access their work or studies.
Contacting your local Title IX Resource Coordinator is not the same as filing a formal complaint with the University Title IX Coordinator. Rather, the Resource Coordinators are a resource to help you make an informed decision about which pathways are right for you.

The Center for WorkLife Law is an advocacy and research organization at UC Law SF that seeks to advance racial, gender, and class equity. At WorkLife Law, we address inequality at a structural level by developing and implementing concrete, evidence-based interventions in schools and workplaces and changing public policy at the state and national levels. We are extremely strategic in how we approach each structural intervention, forging partnerships with grassroots groups and field experts to identify the best change levers to tackle the problem at hand. With our interventions, we aim to produce dramatic changes within a two to five year timeframe. Our main areas of impact are economic security, maternal & child health, education equity, and racial and gender justice in the workplace. Throughout the pandemic, our team has also mobilized a COVID-19 emergency response, applying our legal expertise to help protect workersï¿½ rights during the crisis.
These are just some of the problems that U.S. workers currently face. At the Center for WorkLife Law, we intervene on these problems through both systems-level change and individual interventions.
The Center for WorkLife Law is celebrating the appointment of Sequoia Ayala as a Reproductive Justice Legal Fellow. Sequoia will work to assist birthing persons facing discrimination in the workplace, as well as conduct research on employment discrimination based on pregnancy, lactation, childbirth, and parenthood nationwide for the Center.
Advocating for Strong Implementation to Protect Pregnant Workers
Today the Center for WorkLife Law filed comments with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) offering feedback on its proposed regulations implementing the Pregnant Worker Fairness Act. While the law is already robust, our priority is advocating for the strongest interpretation of the law to protect workers, but especially historically excluded communities, who need accommodations to stay healthy during pregnancy, childbirth, or if they have related medical conditions.
Exciting Advancement of CA Legislation Banning Family Caregiver Discrimination
Californiaï¿½s legislature this week passed important legislation prohibiting discrimination against family caregivers at work! The Family Caregiver Anti-Discrimination Act (AB 524, Wicks) was approved by the California Senate and Assembly and is now headed to the Governorï¿½s desk.ï¿½ WorkLife Law is proud of the central role its advocacy and research have played in bringing California workers so close to winning this critical workplace protection.

The Departmentï¿½s Title IX Liaison was created to help students, staff, faculty, and all in our community deal with any issues concerning sexual and gender-based discrimination, including sexual violence.ï¿½ The current Title IX Liaisons areï¿½ Professors Yuhua Wang and Mashail Malik.
Anyone in the Department can reach out to one of the Liaisons to report misconduct and seek help. The Liaison serves as a neutral point of contact supporting individuals in response to concerns regarding sexual and gender harassment.ï¿½ Here, we are committed to creating an environment of psychological safety, so that people who have experienced or know of instances of sexual harassment are comfortable reporting it.
Itï¿½s important to know that the Liaison is not the sole point of contact for dealing with Title IX issues; it is just one of many options Harvard provides for dealing with these issues. People should feel free to approach anyone inside or outside the Department with whom they feel comfortable sharing their concerns about discrimination, health, and work issues.ï¿½ They do not have to go through the Department of Government Liaison.
Feel free to contact Liaison Prof. Yuhua Wang yuhuawang@fas.harvard.edu or visit his office at CGIS Knafel Bldg., K 214. Or Liaison Prof. Mashail Malik by mashailmalik@fas.harvard.edu or visit her office at CGIS Knafel Bldg., K208.
Liaisons must disclose all known details about potential incidents of harassment.
Under Harvardï¿½s Title IX, all faculty, staff, and grad students are Responsible Employees while employed by Harvard. As a Responsible Employee, the Liaison then must share with a Title IX Coordinator all known details (ï¿½a disclosureï¿½) about potential incidents of sexual or gender-based harassment. However, before revealing details to the Liaison, an individual has the option of working with others,ï¿½on and/or off campus, who can provide varying degrees of confidentiality (e.g. lawyers, doctors, mental health clinicians, clergy, ombuds). The individual can decide whether or not to disclose a potential incident to the Liaison.
Please note that sharing a concern with a Title IX Liaison is not the same as filing a formal complaint; filing a formal complaint is a separate process handled by the Office for Dispute Resolution.ï¿½ Rather, the Liaison is resource to help you make an informed decision about which pathways are right for you. The Title IX Liaison can also arrangeï¿½interimï¿½measures (supports that help members of the Harvard community continue with their studies and work and to participate in campus life) and may facilitateï¿½informalï¿½resolutions, as appropriate, between the involved parties, with a goal of memorializing a mutually acceptable resolution in writing.

This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
ï¿½No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.ï¿½
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner.ï¿½Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.
Title IX regulations guide how colleges and universities, including Harvard, must respondï¿½to sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct through appropriate grievance procedures, supportive measures, and related policies. At Harvard, our policies and procedures not only follow the requirements ofï¿½Title IX regulations, but expand beyond them to also address behaviors that we deem inappropriate for members of the Harvard community.

Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972.
This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.
Title IX regulations guide how colleges and universities, including Harvard, must respond to sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct through appropriate grievance procedures, supportive measures, and related policies. At Harvard, our policies and procedures not only follow the requirements of Title IX regulations, but expand beyond them to also address behaviors that we deem inappropriate for members of the Harvard community.

U.S. Department of Education Confirms Title IX Protects Students from Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | U.S. Department of Education
U.S. Department of Education Confirms Title IX Protects Students from Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity
U.S. Department of Education Confirms Title IX Protects Students from Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity
The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights today issued aï¿½Notice of Interpretation explaining that it will enforce Title IX's prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex to include: (1) discrimination based on sexual orientation; and (2) discrimination based on gender identity. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance.
The Department's interpretation stems from the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision inï¿½Bostock v. Clayton County, issued one year ago this week, in which the Supreme Court recognized that it is impossible to discriminate against a person based on their sexual orientation or gender identity without discriminating against that person based on sex.
"The Supreme Court has upheld the right for LGBTQ+ people to live and work without fear of harassment, exclusion, and discrimination ï¿½ and our LGBTQ+ students have the same rights and deserve the same protections. I'm proud to have directed the Office for Civil Rights to enforce Title IX to protect all students from all forms of sex discrimination," said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. "Today, the Department makes clear that all studentsï¿½including LGBTQ+ studentsï¿½deserve the opportunity to learn and thrive in schools that are free from discrimination."
As OCR recentlyï¿½reported, LGBTQ+ students often face additional challenges in schools, including disproportionately experiencing persistent bullying, harassment, and victimization. The vulnerability of LGBTQ+ students has only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving them without access to school-based mental health services and other supports. Oneï¿½surveyï¿½found that 78 percent of transgender and nonbinary youth reported that their mental health was "poor" either most of the time or always during COVID-19, compared with 61 percent of cisgender youth.
"The Department of Education strives to provide schools with the support they need to create learning environments that enable all students to succeed, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Equity in education means all students have access to schools that allow them to learn and thrive in all aspects of their educational experience," said Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Suzanne B. Goldberg. "As part of our mission to protect all students' civil rights, it is essential that OCR acts to eliminate discrimination that targets LGBTQ+ students."
Today's Notice of Interpretation continues OCR's sustained effort to promote safe and inclusive schools for all students, including LGBTQ+ students. This action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to advance the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, set out in President Biden'sï¿½Executive Order on Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identityï¿½and theï¿½Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.
Our mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.

Executive Order on Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Genderï¿½Identity
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½Section 1. ï¿½Policy. ï¿½It is the policy of my Administration that all students should be guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including discrimination in the form of sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence, and including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. ï¿½For students attending schools and other educational institutions that receive Federal financial assistance, this guarantee is codified, in part, in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½Sec. 2. ï¿½Review of Agency Actions. ï¿½(a) ï¿½Within 100 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions (collectively, agency actions) that are or may be inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, and provide the findings of this review to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½(i) ï¿½ ï¿½As part of the review required under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Education ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½shall review the rule entitled ï¿½Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance,ï¿½ 85 Fed. Reg. 30026 (May 19, 2020), and any other agency actions taken pursuant to that rule, for consistency with governing law, including Title IX, and with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½(ii) ï¿½ As soon as practicable, and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Education shall review existing guidance and issue new guidance as needed on the implementation of the rule described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, for consistency with governing law, including Title IX, and with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½(iii) ï¿½The Secretary of Education shall consider suspending, revising, or rescinding ï¿½ or publishing for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding ï¿½ those agency actions that are inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order as soon as practicable and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and may issue such requests for information as would facilitate doing so. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½(b) ï¿½The Secretary of Education shall consider taking additional enforcement actions, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to enforce the policy set forth in section 1 of this order as well as legal prohibitions on sex discrimination in the form of sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence, to the fullest extent permissible under law; to account for intersecting forms of prohibited discrimination that can affect the availability of resources and support for students who have experienced sex discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race, disability, and national origin; to account for the significant rates at which students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) are subject to sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence; to ensure that educational institutions are providing appropriate support for students who have experienced sex discrimination; and to ensure that their school procedures are fair and equitable for all.Sec. 3. ï¿½General Provisions. ï¿½(a) ï¿½Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½(i) ï¿½ the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; orï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½(ii) ï¿½the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½(b) ï¿½This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½(c) ï¿½This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation | The White House
Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexualï¿½Orientation
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, itï¿½isï¿½hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1.ï¿½ Policy.ï¿½ Every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love.ï¿½ Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports.ï¿½ Adults should be able to earn a living and pursue a vocation knowing that they will not be fired, demoted, or mistreated because of whom they go home to or because how they dress does not conform to sex-based stereotypes.ï¿½ People should be able to access healthcare and secure a roof over their heads without being subjected to sex discrimination.ï¿½ All persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.
These principles are reflected in the Constitution, which promises equal protection of the laws.ï¿½ These principles are also enshrined in our Nationï¿½s anti-discrimination laws, among them Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42ï¿½U.S.C. 2000e et seq.).ï¿½ In Bostock v. Clayton County, 590ï¿½U.S. ___ (2020), the Supreme Court held that Title VIIï¿½s prohibition on discrimination ï¿½because of . . . sexï¿½ covers discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.ï¿½ Under Bostockï¿½s reasoning, laws that prohibit sex discrimination ï¿½ including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), the Fair Housing Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), and section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1522), along with their respective implementing regulations ï¿½ prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.
Discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation manifests differently for different individuals, and it often overlaps with other forms of prohibited discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race or disability.ï¿½ For example, transgender Black Americans face unconscionably high levels of workplace discrimination, homelessness, and violence, including fatal violence.
It is the policy of my Administration to prevent and combatï¿½discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, and to fully enforce Title VII and other laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.ï¿½ It is also the policy of my Administration to address overlapping forms of discrimination.
Sec. 2.ï¿½ Enforcing Prohibitions on Sex Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.ï¿½ (a)ï¿½ The head of each agency shall, as soon as practicable and in consultation with the Attorney General, as appropriate, review all existing orders, regulations, guidance documents, policies, programs, or other agency actions (ï¿½agency actionsï¿½) that:
(i) ï¿½ were promulgated or are administered by the agency under Title VII or any other statute or regulation that prohibits sex discrimination, including any that relate to the agencyï¿½s own compliance with such statutes or regulations; and
(b)ï¿½ The head of each agency shall, as soon as practicable and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), consider whether to revise, suspend, or rescind such agency actions, or promulgate new agency actions, as necessary to fully implement statutes that prohibit sex discrimination and the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.
(c)ï¿½ The head of each agency shall, as soon as practicable, also consider whether there are additional actions that the agency should take to ensure that it is fully implementing the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.ï¿½ If an agency takes an action described in this subsection or subsection (b) of this section, it shall seek to ensure that it is accounting for, andï¿½taking appropriate steps to combat, overlapping forms of discrimination, such as discrimination on the basis of race orï¿½disability.
(d)ï¿½ Within 100 days of the date of this order, the head ofï¿½each agency shall develop, in consultation with the Attorney General, as appropriate, a plan to carry out actions that the agency has identified pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.
Sec. 3.ï¿½ Definition. ï¿½ï¿½Agencyï¿½ means any authority of the United States that is an ï¿½agencyï¿½ under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined inï¿½44 U.S.C. 3502(5).
(ii)ï¿½ the functions of the Director of the Office ofï¿½Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b)ï¿½ This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c)ï¿½ This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Today, new U.S. Department of Education (DOE) rules on Title IX, the law that prohibits sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funds, took effect. In order to comply with the new federal regulations, Harvard has implemented interim policies and procedures. The Gazette spoke with Title IX coordinatorï¿½Nicole Merhill to discuss what has changed and how the University was able to implement these changes in the very short timeline set forth by the DOE, with the input of community members across Harvard.
GAZETTE: Would you provide some of the context around the U.S. Department of Educationï¿½s decision to issue new Title IX rules?
MERHILL: In November of 2018, the DOE published proposed amendments to the Title IX regulations, specifically as applied to sexual harassment, including sexual assault and sexual violence, at elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions.
Consistent with the rule-making process, individuals were invited to comment on the proposed regulations. Ultimately, the department received over 120,000 comments, which they were then required to review and consider. This process took over a year and a half and resulted in approximately 2,000 pages of preamble to the final rules themselves, where the department responded to the comments and concerns that were raised during this comment period. The final Title IX regulations, published in May 2020, go into effect Aug. 14, 2020, which means all Title IX policies and procedures must be updated to reflect the new regulations by Aug. 14, 2020. Which brings us to today.
MERHILL: It is. The DOE gave 70 working days to read and understand a document with more than 2,000 pages and then to implement changes corresponding to that document. By comparison, in October 2014, the DOE published the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) amendments to the Clery Act, and afforded institutions nearly nine months (until July 2015) to make changes to ensure compliance with the new amendments. Thatï¿½s a big difference to begin with and the changes to the Title IX regulations are far more expansive than those included in the VAWA amendments. And now, we find ourselves in the midst of a pandemic, with the vast majority of our community members in remote settings, which makes it even more challenging. Of course, we deeply value the input of Harvardï¿½s students, faculty, and staff, and without it, it would be next to impossible to navigate the critical decisions weï¿½ve been forced to make with regard to changing our rules and regulations on Title IX.
GAZETTE:ï¿½ Yet here we are. Our new Title IX policies and procedures must take effect today, according to federal law. How was the University able to put together these new rules and regulations with all of these hurdles in place?
MERHILL: First and foremost, I am grateful that so many community members did engage in this process this summer, despite the fact that we are all doing our best to navigate the current pandemic, and living and working in towns and cities all over the world. Over the past few months, my team has engaged a diverse set of groups across Harvard, including with students and staff from our Title IX liaison working groups, staff members from the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR), response peer counselors, care peer educators, and members of Our Harvard Can Do Better (OHCDB). Weï¿½ve met virtually with the co-presidents of the Undergraduate Council, and with individual students, staff, and faculty members, all of whom provided key input on decision points related to the new requirements set forth by the DOE, and how we could best implement them here at Harvard. There were meetings with individual deans as well as discussions at the Provostï¿½s Council to assure that the viewpoints of many constituencies were represented.
As a preliminary matter, everyone agreed that in light of the challenging timeline, current circumstances, and the importance of these decisions, these policies and procedures should be interim ones. We knew that we must all work together to ensure that they protect the safety of everyone within Harvardï¿½s community, while providing fair processes for the parties involved when instances of sexual harassment or misconduct occur. Over the next 12 months, we will incorporate the experiences and perspectives of community members into closely examining the interim policies and procedures, while making modifications as appropriate to meet the needs of the community and ensuring compliance with the law.
Harvard will enact two interim policies: The first ï¿½ Harvard University Interim Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy ï¿½ was developed in response to the recent changes to the Title IX regulations, issued by the Department of Education on May 6 of 2020. The second ï¿½ Harvard University Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy ï¿½ will address misconduct that falls outside the jurisdiction of the first and was previously addressed under the Universityï¿½s Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy.
Why do this? Because Harvard remains committed to going beyond the minimum requirements stipulated by the new Title IX regulations and to addressing the same types of conduct we addressed prior to the DOEï¿½s changes.
GAZETTE:ï¿½ I think youï¿½re beginning to get at one of the major changes required by the DOE, which relates to how sexual harassment is defined according to Title IX, and how Harvard has decided to address this change.
MERHILL: Thatï¿½s right. Under the new regulations, sexual harassment is defined as conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the Universityï¿½s education, work programs, or activities. The new definition does include quid pro quo harassment, which was included in the prior rules, as well as four new categories of conduct now considered per se sexual harassment. These include sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. The alleged conduct must happen against a person in the United States on University property or in connection with a University program or activity. The new Title IX regulations require that we dismiss those matters that do not meet this definition but they do allow schools to address the allegations under other misconduct policies within the institutions themselves.
This is a substantial shift from the old definition of sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct that is severe, persistent, or pervasive: concerns have been raised about the use of the conjunctive ï¿½andï¿½ in the new definition instead of the disjunctive ï¿½orï¿½ in the old definition, as being more restrictive. Additionally, the old regulations did not require the conduct to take place in the United States and did not include the prescriptive requirement of dismissal, which allowed institutions to go beyond the minimum regulatory requirements.
Many students have raised concerns about the new definition of sexual harassment, in particular as it relates to conduct during study-abroad programs or as part of field sites. Taking into consideration the feedback from the community, we decided it was essential to adopt a second policy ï¿½ the Other Sexual Misconduct Policy ï¿½ to address conduct no longer addressed under the new Title IX regulations, including but not limited to conduct that takes place outside of the United States.
ï¿½Harvard remains committed to going beyond the minimum requirements stipulated by the new Title IX regulations and to addressing the same types of conduct we addressed prior to the DOEï¿½s changes.ï¿½
GAZETTE: What are some of the other major changes you and your colleagues have worked hard to implement over the summer?
MERHILL: One that a lot of individuals are concerned with is the new requirement that colleges and universities provide live hearings when instances of sexual misconduct are reported. Advisers for both parties must be allowed to engage in cross-examination of the parties, witnesses, and advisers during these hearings. This marks a very big change. There were a lot of questions to consider ï¿½ how do you protect the privacy, and safety, of the parties involved under this new model? Who is going to preside over these hearings ï¿½ will they be University officials or representatives from outside the University? Weï¿½re already at work on building a space for these hearings in the Smith Campus Center that will be designed to preserve the safety and privacy of community members involved in the filing of a complaint of misconduct.
GAZETTE: The DOE has also changed the standard of evidence that can be used in investigations of sexual misconduct, has it not?
MERHILL: Yes. Previous federal guidance mandated that colleges and universities use a ï¿½preponderance of the evidenceï¿½ standard in determining responsibility during the investigation of formal complaints involving sexual harassment and assault. The new Title IX regulations afford institutions the flexibility to choose either a ï¿½preponderance of the evidenceï¿½ or ï¿½clear and convincingï¿½ standard. In short, ï¿½clear and convincingï¿½ requires a higher burden of proof.
During our conversations with academic leadership, students, faculty, and staff this summer, the overwhelming response was for us to maintain the ï¿½preponderance of the evidenceï¿½ standard in our procedures for formal complaints of sexual harassment and misconduct, and this is what we are going to do.
GAZETTE: What are some of the other prevailing decision points that community members helped you navigate over the summer?
MERHILL: Let me reiterate just how appreciative I am for all of the thoughtfulness, care, and patience of all of those who have worked with us over the previous few months. There have been many. One example which I already briefly touched upon has to do with identifying who should serve as the decision-maker in a live hearing. Would we have a single hearing decision-maker or multiple ones, would it be made up of individuals internal to the University, or persons external?
What we heard from people is that it would be beneficial to have some internal individuals who are familiar with the culture and structures at Harvard, along with some external to Harvard. We also heard pretty much unanimously from community members that we should have a panel as opposed to a single decision-maker. Based on this input, Harvard will adopt a hybrid panel of two individuals from a list of trained administrators and faculty, and one person from a list of external attorneys.
Another point of decision-making was around the responsible-employee model. Prior to the new rules, and according to Harvard policy, any staff or faculty member who receives notice of harassment, meaning either if someone actually comes to them with a concern, or theyï¿½re aware of a potential concern within their community more broadly, is required to share that concern with either a Title IX resource within their School or unit, or with the University Title IX Office. The new Title IX regulations no longer follow the responsible-employee model, and instead identify a much smaller group of individuals as responsible for sharing concerns with Title IX. In meeting with community members throughout this summer we heard, again overwhelmingly, that community members want Harvard to keep this model in place. Again, based on this feedback, the responsible-employee model will remain across both of our new policies.
GAZETTE: What can community members do if theyï¿½d like to learn more about, or offer input regarding, the interim policies over the coming year?
MERHILL: Itï¿½s important that everyone at Harvard knows that all existing Title IX resources, including those related to training and support, reporting, and investigations, remain in place, even during the difficult times of this pandemic. School and unit Title IX Resource Coordinators remain the primary points of contact for students, staff, and faculty, including for the provision of supportive measures. Title IX trainings, including bystander-intervention training, trainings around gender inclusivity and other topics, continue to happen, along with updates on what is changing with Title IX rules and in the world. An example: Updates to training modules actually now also include an example of harassment on Zoom. We have new prevention initiatives online that individuals can access via our website. Anonymous online reporting still exists. And ODR continues to be able to receive, and investigate, formal complaints ï¿½ they have long been able to do so, and had remote processes in place long before the spread of the coronavirus.
Iï¿½d encourage everyone to read our At-a-Glance document for a quick overview of the changes to Harvardï¿½s policies and procedures on sexual harassment and misconduct. As President [Larry] Bacow has said in the past, all of us at Harvard have a role to play in ensuring that each of us who calls this University home feels welcome, and safe. Weï¿½re grateful for the opportunity to engage with so many caring and thoughtful individuals across Harvardï¿½s Schools and units.
