Racial or ethnic harassment will not be tolerated in the university community..Anyone who has experienced or observed racial or ethnic harassment is encouraged to report the incident to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.State and Federal LawsIn addition to violating KU policy and our community standards, racial and ethnic harassment may violate state and federal laws, including:Civil Rights Act of 1964.

ProcedurePurpose:ï¿½To outline the procedures for the handling of sexual harassment and sexual violence at the University of Kansas
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination, including harassment and violence, on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Retaliation for making good faith complaints of prohibited discrimination is also prohibited by University policy. The following office has been designated to handle inquiries regarding Title IX: Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Suite 1082, Lawrence, KS, 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY.
ï¿½Advisorï¿½ is an individual who was not a witness or otherwise involved in the allegations of the complaint and acts as a representative for either the complaint or the respondent. An Advisor may be present for any questioning of their ï¿½clientï¿½ during the investigation but is expected to play a passive role. An Advisor (does not have to be the same as during the investigation) also represents each party during the subsequent hearing and participates by questioning the opposing party. The Advisor may also question witnesses during the hearing on behalf of their party. For purposes of the hearing, an Advisor will be appointed by the University if either party does not select an Advisor for themselves.
ï¿½Complainantï¿½ï¿½is the person who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment.
"Consentï¿½ï¿½is communicated, ongoing, and mutual. This means consent is gained through words or actions that show an active, knowing and voluntary agreement to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity. It is the responsibility of the initiator, or the person who wants to engage in the specific sexual activity to make sure that the initiator has consent. Consent cannot be gained by force, by ignoring or acting without regard to the objections of another, or by taking advantage of the incapacitation of another, where the accused knows or reasonably should have known of such incapacitation. For example, a person who is intoxicated may not be capable of giving consent. Consent is also absent when the activity in question exceeds the scope of consent previously given or when the person from whom consent is sought is deemed incapable of giving consent under the law of the State of Kansas. A person always has the right to revoke Consent at any time during a sexual act. Consent to one act does not constitute consent to another act. Consent on a prior occasion does not constitute consent on a subsequent occasion. Silence, lack of resistance, or failure to say ï¿½noï¿½ does not imply consent.
Where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
ï¿½Domestic Violenceï¿½ï¿½is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that personï¿½s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.
ï¿½Education Program or Activityï¿½ includes locations, events, or circumstances over which the University of Kansas exercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs and includes houses located off campus that are owned or controlled by a recognized student organization
ï¿½Formal Complaintï¿½ is a document filed/signed by a complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment against a respondent and requesting that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigate the allegation of sexual harassment.
ï¿½Hostile Environment Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities.
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a mannerï¿½that does not interfere with First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employeeï¿½s official duties. Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employeeï¿½s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive. In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
ï¿½Incapacitationï¿½ï¿½means the physical and/or mental inability to make informed, rational judgments. Where alcohol and/or drugs are involved, incapacitation is defined with respect to how the alcohol or drugs consumed impact a personï¿½s decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make fully informed judgments.
ï¿½Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individualï¿½s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
ï¿½Reportï¿½ means any communication to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, by whatever form, of a belief that a violation of Title IX has occurred. A report does not constitute a formal complaint.
ï¿½Respondentï¿½ï¿½is the person who has been reported to be the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment or retaliation.
Penetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. An ï¿½objectï¿½ or ï¿½instrumentï¿½ is anything used by the offender other than the offenderï¿½s genitalia.
Touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual Harassment:ï¿½ï¿½Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
ï¿½Stalkingï¿½ï¿½is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.ï¿½ For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:
Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a personï¿½s property.
Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.
Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.
ï¿½Standard of Proofï¿½ï¿½in investigating and adjudicating violations under the Title IX Resolution Procedures is the preponderance of the evidence standard. The preponderance of the evidence means the fact in dispute is more likely than not to be true.
ï¿½Studentï¿½ï¿½means all persons enrolled at the Lawrence and/or Edwards campuses, either full time or part time, pursuing undergraduate, graduate, or professional studies, as well as non-degree students. This also includes individuals who confirm their intent to enroll in programs, those attending orientation sessions, and those who were enrolled at the date of an alleged incident. Persons who withdraw after allegedly violating the student code or who are not officially enrolled for a particular term but who have a continuing relationship with the University are considered ï¿½students.ï¿½
ï¿½Third Party Reporterï¿½ï¿½means any individual making a report who is not the complainant in the situation.ï¿½
ï¿½Title IX Coordinatorï¿½ï¿½means the individual designated by the University to coordinate the Universityï¿½s compliance with Title IX, including overseeing all Sexual Harassment complaints and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints, and the Title IX Coordinator's designee. The University has designated the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX as the Universityï¿½s Title IX Coordinator. References to actions that may be taken by the Title IX Coordinator may be undertaken by the Title IX Coordinator or designee (e.g., a trained investigator).
ï¿½Universityï¿½ï¿½means the University of Kansas, Lawrence, and all units that report to it.ï¿½ Units include controlled affiliates.
The University of Kansas is committed to resolving Title IX complaints in a timely and effective manner and providing prompt corrective action if a violation of policy is believed to have occurred. The Title IX resolution process is intended to provide effective resolution for complaints of sex based discrimination including sexual harassment as defined in the Sexual Harassment Policy, which includes sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking.
The University's Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy extends to educational programs or activities of the University of Kansas and extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and an individual's associates that may arise as a result of a Title IX complaint made in good faith or otherwise participating in the Title IX resolution process. This policy does not extend to incidents that occur outside of the United States.
For incidents occurring outside of the United States or outside of the University of Kansas educational programs or activities but where an on-campus safety issue has been identified, the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process will be utilized. For cases involving a course of conduct occurring both on and off campus, the University may proceed under either the Title IX Resolution Process or the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process.
Any person with knowledge of prohibited sexual harassment, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking in the Universityï¿½s employment practices or educational programs or activities may contact theï¿½Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.
Reports may be filed via the online reporting form on the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX website (www.civilrights.ku.edu), by email to civilrights@ku.edu, or by phone to 785-864-6414; 711 TTY.ï¿½All reports through the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX online reporting form, reports made by email or phone, and reports from third-party reporters, such as mandatory reporters, are not considered formal complaints to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will acknowledge receipt of the report within three (3) working days. A person need not have University affiliation to submit a report of discrimination.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IXï¿½s goal at all times is to protect, to the extent possible, individualsï¿½ access to University educational programs and activities. Accordingly, upon receiving a report of sexual harassment, the Office of Civil Rights will offer and implement appropriate supportive measures to the complainant and respondent, as appropriate, before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed.
Such measures will be non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services, including but not limited to a mutual directive to the parties to have no contact with each other (a ï¿½No Contact Directiveï¿½), changes to living arrangements, changes to class schedules, counseling, campus escort services, and other measures designed to restore or preserve access to the educational programs and activities, protect the safety of all parties and the educational environment, and to deter harassment and retaliation. Such measures will not be unduly burdensome to either party and will not require a fee or charge.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will implement supportive measures to the extent possible as appropriate and as reasonably available.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will keep supportive measures confidential to the extent that the confidentiality would not impair the ability of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to provide the supportive measures.
Upon completion of an individualized safety and risk analysis, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that a respondent poses an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or individual exists and make a recommendation to the VPSA for the emergency removal of the student due to the allegation(s) of sexual harassment. The VPSA may also complete the individualized health and safety risk analysis and remove the respondent. The respondent will be notified of the removal decision in writing and shall have an opportunity to challenge the removal decision pursuant to the Student Non-Academic Conduct Procedures.
Employees of the University may be placed on administrative leave during the pendency of the Title IX processes including the investigative process and hearing process.
The University takes all discrimination complaints seriously. However, knowingly filing a false complaint is considered serious misconduct and is also subject to sanction. An individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints that harass colleagues and/or abuse the complaint resolution process may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time. Such cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of University Senate Rules and Regulations section 6.5.4, Abuse of Grievance Process.
The process for responding to Title IX complaints may include informal resolution (which may include mediation, restorative justice, or other educational resolutions), formal investigations, or supportive measures (which are available during both informal resolutions and formal investigations). If the subject matter or issue of the complaint does not fall under this policy, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff may advise the complainant of other available procedures.
Complainants are encouraged to file their formal complaints within one hundred eighty (180) days of any occurrence of alleged discrimination. A formal complaint must be made while the complainant is still enrolled which the University of Kansas, intends to re-enroll in the University of Kansas, employed by the University of Kansas, or participating or attempting to participate in an education program of the University of Kansas.
The Title IX Coordinator, in their discretion, may file a signed formal complaint regarding the alleged violation of the Sexual Harassment Policy. Situations where the Title IX Coordinator might file a formal complaint include incidents involving weapons, incidents involving multiple respondents, situations where the respondent has multiple reports alleging violations of the sexual harassment policy, the complainant is a minor, or other situations where the Title IX Coordinator feels it is necessary to protect the campus community.
A report or formal complaint of sexual harassment or retaliation to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX should include the following, to the extent known and available:
Nature of the alleged sexual harassment (i.e., sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, stalking, or retaliation);
To remove barriers of reporting and participation in the investigative and hearing process under the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy, student parties including complainants, respondents, and witnesses shall not be subjected to discipline under the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities for the personal consumption of alcohol and/or drugs. The Director of Student Conduct and Community Standards may at their discretion assign educational interventions when there is concern regarding the safety of a student in connection to the studentï¿½s alcohol or drug use.
Upon receipt of a report, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly reach out to the complainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures with or without filing a formal complaint and explain to the complainant the process for filing a formal complaint as well as the opportunity to meet with the Title IX Coordinator. During the initial meeting, the complainant has the option of requesting supportive measures as well as filing a formal complaint. The complainant also has the option of requesting the University to take no further action on the report. When the complainant requests that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX take no action, the Title IX Coordinator reserves the right to file a signed formal complaint.
Upon receiving a formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall conduct an initial evaluation of the formal complaint and determine the appropriate action required. Where the University or its employees are accused of sexual harassment, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will contact the dean, director, administrator, supervisor, or chairperson responsible for the unit that is accused of sexual harassment to inform them of the filing of the formal complaint. When necessary, appropriate administrator(s) or faculty member(s) may be designated by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Vice Provost, Dean, Director, or Chairperson, by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or by the Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX to participate in the evaluation of the formal complaint and to facilitate necessary action.
In conducting its initial review of the formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may meet with the Complainant or take other steps to learn the basis of the formal complaint, including examining University records.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may dismiss a formal complaint if at any time during the investigation:
A complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein;
The complaint was filed when the complainant was not participating or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of the University; or
Specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.
If it is determined that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will not proceed with investigation of a formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will notify the complainant (if not anonymous) and respondent in writing explaining the reasons why the complaint is not being investigated under Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may notify the complainant that their formal complaint will be investigated under the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process or that the matter is being referred to another office for review. The notification letter will include a statement regarding the complainant and respondent right to appeal the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX decision if no formal investigation will occur under this policy.
A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy, and articulates sufficient facts, which if determined to be accurate, would support a finding that the University's Sexual Harassment Policy has been violated.
Respondents are presumed not to be responsible for the allegations of the complaint until a conclusion is reached at the end of the investigation.
The University will strive to complete investigations of formal complaints, including issuance of a report of findings to the complainant and respondent, in as timely and efficient a manner as possible within sixty (60) working days of receipt of a complaint. However, this timeframe may be extended based on factors such as, but not limited to, schedule and availability of witnesses, concurrent law enforcement activity, holidays or semester breaks including summer break, and complexity of the complaint. If an investigation cannot be completed within sixty (60) working days of receipt of the complaint, then the investigator(s) will notify the complainant and respondent the investigation timeframe is being extended and provide a timeframe for completing the investigation.
Investigators assigned to conduct an investigation will be impartial. In conducting investigations into violations of the Universityï¿½s Policies, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will use a preponderance of the evidence standard in making factual determinations. The preponderance of the evidence means the fact in dispute is more likely than not to be true. The investigation will include the following elements:
Contact with Complainant.ï¿½If the investigator did not speak with the complainant at the time that the formal complaint was received by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, then the investigator will meet or speak with the complainant at the start of the investigation and throughout the investigation as appropriate.
Notice to Respondent.ï¿½The respondent will be provided with a statement of the complaint in writing, and the complainant will be provided a copy of this notification. The notice will include:
That the respondent is presumed not to be responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination will be reached at the end of the investigation;
The respondentï¿½s right to an advisor (who may be an attorney) of the respondentï¿½s choice and to review all evidence gathered prior to the conclusion of the investigation; and
That University policies prohibit knowingly making false statement or submitting false information during the investigation process.
Respondents will be provided an opportunity to meet with the investigator(s) investigating the complaint and to respond to the allegation and to meet or speak with the investigator throughout the investigation as appropriate. Respondents may respond in person or in writing within a reasonable time to be determined by the investigators. If a respondent chooses not to participate or refuses to answer a complaint, the nonparticipation will not prevent the investigation from proceeding.
Notice regarding Retaliation.ï¿½All parties to a complaint (complainant, respondent, witnesses, and appropriate administrators or supervisors) will be informed that retaliation, defined in Section VI, by an individual or an individual's associates against any person who files a complaint or any person who participates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation are subject to disciplinary action.
Representation.ï¿½In any meeting with the investigators, the parties to the complaint (complainant and the respondent) may bring an advisor to the meeting, up to three (3). If the advisor is an attorney, the party must notify the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing at least three (3) working days before the meeting date.
Notice of all Meetings. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide to a party whose participation is invited or expected, written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purposes of all meetings including investigative interviews. Email is the primary form of written communication for the University of Kansas and the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide sufficient time to prepare to participate by allowing at least three (3) working-dayï¿½s notice unless the party requests a date and time allowing less than three (3) working days.
Information relevant to Investigation.ï¿½The complainant and respondent will be informed that they have the opportunity to identify witnesses, present witness statements, and submit any other evidence they believe relevant to resolution of the complaint. The investigator(s) will interview other persons whom, at the investigator(s)' discretion determines to be necessary to gather relevant information. The investigator(s) will review any written materials, e- mails, text messages, or other evidence that, at the investigator(s)ï¿½ discretion, may provide relevant information regarding the complaint. The burden of gathering evidence rests on the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.
Medical Records.ï¿½ No reports will be accessed, disclosed, or used that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in their capacity, or assisting in that capacity, which are made and maintained in connection to the treatment of the party without that partyï¿½s voluntary and written consent to do so.
Privileged Information.ï¿½ The investigator will not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding the privilege has waived the privilege.
Witness Summary.ï¿½ Witnesses may request, and Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide, a reasonable opportunity to review the investigatorï¿½s summary of that individualï¿½s interview and the opportunity to submit a written response to the summary.
Review of Evidence and Preliminary Report. Upon completion of the preliminary investigation report, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide the complainant and respondent, as well as the advisor of each party, an opportunity to inspect and review all evidence collected during the course of the investigation to include summaries of investigative interviews, physical evidence, inculpatory evidence, exculpatory evidence, and evidence upon which the investigator has collected but does not intend to rely. The complainant and respondent, and advisor to each party, will have ten (10) calendar days to submit a written response to the evidence. The investigator will consider the written responses prior to the completion of the final investigative report.
Final Investigative Report. After the end of the ten (10) calendar day period during which the complainant and respondent have the ability to review all evidence and preliminary report, the investigator will objectively evaluate all relevant evidence ï¿½ including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence ï¿½ and will draft a final investigative report. The investigative report will fairly summarize relevant evidence.
A copy of the final investigative report will be provided simultaneously to both parties, as well as the advisor for each party, and to the appropriate administrator(s).
The hearing panel is not bound by the relevance determinations in the investigative report and the final decision as to relevance shall be made by the Hearing Panel Chair.
Upon completion of the final investigative report, the report will be forwarded to the appropriate administrator(s) for the scheduling of a live hearing. The live hearing will be scheduled for no sooner than fourteen (14) calendar days. Live hearings will contain, at a minimum, the opportunity to cross exam parties through a partyï¿½s advisor. If a party does not have an advisor, one will be provided by the University for the live hearing. All live hearings will be subject to the Hearing Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Harassment.
No person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing. Disciplinary action, harassment, unsupported evaluations, or other adverse changes in the conditions of employment or the educational environment may also constitute retaliation. Retaliation will not be tolerated and could result in suspension, reassignment, salary reduction, termination, expulsion, or other disciplinary action. Formal complaints of retaliation related to investigations under the policy will be handled under the Title IX Resolution Process.
Nothing in this retaliation section limits the ability of the complainant and respondent to discuss the allegation under investigation or to gather and present relevant evidence. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute retaliation. Charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a grievance proceeding under this part does not constitute retaliation.
If a complainant or respondent believes that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX has erred in its decision to administratively close the complaint without a full investigation, that party may appeal the closure to the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, within seven (7) calendar days of the date of the notice of the investigator's findings. The request for an appeal must be a signed, written document articulating why the investigator's dismissal of the formal complaint is erroneous.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, shall notify the other party and the Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing of an appeal of the dismissal of formal complaint and allow the other party seven (7) calendar days to submit a written statement. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also be asked to submit a response or to provide additional information regarding the case.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, will respond to the appeal in writing to both complainant and respondent within twenty (20) calendar days of receiving the respondentï¿½s written statement or the conclusion of the seven (7) calendar days to submit a statement. This decision on appeal will constitute final agency action and there will be no further appeal within the University.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, will not conduct a new investigation of the Complaint or substitute their judgment for that of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. Rather, on appeal, the Complainant must show that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX has erred in one or more of the following ways and that the error caused actual prejudice to the outcome of the investigation:
There was procedural irregularity by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX that affected the outcome of the matter.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX improperly failed to gather or consider information relevant to the complaint.
Based upon the totality of the information in the record, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.
New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of the dismissal that could affect the outcome of the matter.
The Title IX Coordinator or investigator had a conflict of interest for or against complainants and respondents generally or the individual complainant and respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.
After submission of a formal complaint, either party may request an opportunity to resolve the complaint through an informal resolution process. If requested by one party, the other party must voluntarily agree to participate in order for the informal resolution process to proceed. A successful resolution and agreement of the parties will result in dismissal of the complaint without further investigation or hearing. Prior to reaching an agreement, either party may withdraw from the process and request that the grievance procedures pursuant to this policy resume.
An informal resolution process will be facilitated by an individual who is trained, unbiased and without conflict. The informal resolution process will be conducted in accordance with informal resolution procedures.
The informal resolution process is not available when the complaint alleges a violation by an employee against a student.
Members of the University community who are found to have violated the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy are subject to disciplinary actions appropriate to their status as faculty, staff, or student employees or as students. Disciplinary actions can range from a warning to a dismissal or termination. Disciplinary actions for students can be found in section VII of the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, disciplinary actions for faculty can be found in Article VI of the Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, and disciplinary actions for Staff can be found in the Disciplinary Action Policy for Staff.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will handle all discrimination and harassment complaints discreetly but cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity because the University has an obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment and to maintain a safe environment, free from harassment and discrimination. Because of its obligations under the law, KU will not be able to honor all requests for confidentiality or all requests that a complaint not be pursued.
Employees may file employment discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. Students may file discrimination complaints through the Office of Civil Rights in the U. S. Department of Education or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX can provide information about deadlines and filing procedures for the state and federal agencies.
The University will maintain all records of each sexual harassment investigation for a period of seven (7) years to include any determination regarding responsibility, any audio or audiovisual recording or transcript, any disciplinary sanctions imposed on the respondent, any remedies provided to the complainant designed to restore and preserve access to the Universityï¿½s educational programs or activities, any appeals and the results therefrom, and informal resolutions and the results therefrom, and all materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and any person who facilitates an informal resolution process.
For each report and formal complaint falling under this Title IX process, before closing the file, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall document all actions taken in response and all measures taken to restore or preserve access to educational programs and activities of the University. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX also shall document the basis for its conclusion that the Universityï¿½s response was not deliberately indifferent, and where no supportive measures have been provided, why the Universityï¿½s response was not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.
[1]ï¿½ The Universityï¿½s definition of ï¿½Sexual Assaultï¿½ is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.ï¿½ Those regulations require the University to adopt a definition of ï¿½Sexual Assaultï¿½ that incorporates various forcible and non-forcible sex crimes as defined by the FBIï¿½s Uniform Crime Reporting System.ï¿½ See 34 C.F.R. ï¿½ 106.30(a).

ProcedurePurpose:ï¿½To outline the procedures for the handling of sexual harassment and sexual violence at the University of Kansas
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination, including harassment and violence, on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Retaliation for making good faith complaints of prohibited discrimination is also prohibited by University policy. The following office has been designated to handle inquiries regarding Title IX: Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Suite 1082, Lawrence, KS, 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY.
ï¿½Advisorï¿½ is an individual who was not a witness or otherwise involved in the allegations of the complaint and acts as a representative for either the complaint or the respondent. An Advisor may be present for any questioning of their ï¿½clientï¿½ during the investigation but is expected to play a passive role. An Advisor (does not have to be the same as during the investigation) also represents each party during the subsequent hearing and participates by questioning the opposing party. The Advisor may also question witnesses during the hearing on behalf of their party. For purposes of the hearing, an Advisor will be appointed by the University if either party does not select an Advisor for themselves.
ï¿½Complainantï¿½ï¿½is the person who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment.
"Consentï¿½ï¿½is communicated, ongoing, and mutual. This means consent is gained through words or actions that show an active, knowing and voluntary agreement to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity. It is the responsibility of the initiator, or the person who wants to engage in the specific sexual activity to make sure that the initiator has consent. Consent cannot be gained by force, by ignoring or acting without regard to the objections of another, or by taking advantage of the incapacitation of another, where the accused knows or reasonably should have known of such incapacitation. For example, a person who is intoxicated may not be capable of giving consent. Consent is also absent when the activity in question exceeds the scope of consent previously given or when the person from whom consent is sought is deemed incapable of giving consent under the law of the State of Kansas. A person always has the right to revoke Consent at any time during a sexual act. Consent to one act does not constitute consent to another act. Consent on a prior occasion does not constitute consent on a subsequent occasion. Silence, lack of resistance, or failure to say ï¿½noï¿½ does not imply consent.
Where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
ï¿½Domestic Violenceï¿½ï¿½is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that personï¿½s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.
ï¿½Education Program or Activityï¿½ includes locations, events, or circumstances over which the University of Kansas exercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs and includes houses located off campus that are owned or controlled by a recognized student organization
ï¿½Formal Complaintï¿½ is a document filed/signed by a complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment against a respondent and requesting that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigate the allegation of sexual harassment.
ï¿½Hostile Environment Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities.
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a mannerï¿½that does not interfere with First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employeeï¿½s official duties. Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employeeï¿½s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive. In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
ï¿½Incapacitationï¿½ï¿½means the physical and/or mental inability to make informed, rational judgments. Where alcohol and/or drugs are involved, incapacitation is defined with respect to how the alcohol or drugs consumed impact a personï¿½s decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make fully informed judgments.
ï¿½Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individualï¿½s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
ï¿½Reportï¿½ means any communication to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, by whatever form, of a belief that a violation of Title IX has occurred. A report does not constitute a formal complaint.
ï¿½Respondentï¿½ï¿½is the person who has been reported to be the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment or retaliation.
Penetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. An ï¿½objectï¿½ or ï¿½instrumentï¿½ is anything used by the offender other than the offenderï¿½s genitalia.
Touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual Harassment:ï¿½ï¿½Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
ï¿½Stalkingï¿½ï¿½is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.ï¿½ For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:
Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a personï¿½s property.
Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.
Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.
ï¿½Standard of Proofï¿½ï¿½in investigating and adjudicating violations under the Title IX Resolution Procedures is the preponderance of the evidence standard. The preponderance of the evidence means the fact in dispute is more likely than not to be true.
ï¿½Studentï¿½ï¿½means all persons enrolled at the Lawrence and/or Edwards campuses, either full time or part time, pursuing undergraduate, graduate, or professional studies, as well as non-degree students. This also includes individuals who confirm their intent to enroll in programs, those attending orientation sessions, and those who were enrolled at the date of an alleged incident. Persons who withdraw after allegedly violating the student code or who are not officially enrolled for a particular term but who have a continuing relationship with the University are considered ï¿½students.ï¿½
ï¿½Third Party Reporterï¿½ï¿½means any individual making a report who is not the complainant in the situation.ï¿½
ï¿½Title IX Coordinatorï¿½ï¿½means the individual designated by the University to coordinate the Universityï¿½s compliance with Title IX, including overseeing all Sexual Harassment complaints and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints, and the Title IX Coordinator's designee. The University has designated the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX as the Universityï¿½s Title IX Coordinator. References to actions that may be taken by the Title IX Coordinator may be undertaken by the Title IX Coordinator or designee (e.g., a trained investigator).
ï¿½Universityï¿½ï¿½means the University of Kansas, Lawrence, and all units that report to it.ï¿½ Units include controlled affiliates.
The University of Kansas is committed to resolving Title IX complaints in a timely and effective manner and providing prompt corrective action if a violation of policy is believed to have occurred. The Title IX resolution process is intended to provide effective resolution for complaints of sex based discrimination including sexual harassment as defined in the Sexual Harassment Policy, which includes sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking.
The University's Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy extends to educational programs or activities of the University of Kansas and extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and an individual's associates that may arise as a result of a Title IX complaint made in good faith or otherwise participating in the Title IX resolution process. This policy does not extend to incidents that occur outside of the United States.
For incidents occurring outside of the United States or outside of the University of Kansas educational programs or activities but where an on-campus safety issue has been identified, the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process will be utilized. For cases involving a course of conduct occurring both on and off campus, the University may proceed under either the Title IX Resolution Process or the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process.
Any person with knowledge of prohibited sexual harassment, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking in the Universityï¿½s employment practices or educational programs or activities may contact theï¿½Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.
Reports may be filed via the online reporting form on the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX website (www.civilrights.ku.edu), by email to civilrights@ku.edu, or by phone to 785-864-6414; 711 TTY.ï¿½All reports through the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX online reporting form, reports made by email or phone, and reports from third-party reporters, such as mandatory reporters, are not considered formal complaints to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will acknowledge receipt of the report within three (3) working days. A person need not have University affiliation to submit a report of discrimination.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IXï¿½s goal at all times is to protect, to the extent possible, individualsï¿½ access to University educational programs and activities. Accordingly, upon receiving a report of sexual harassment, the Office of Civil Rights will offer and implement appropriate supportive measures to the complainant and respondent, as appropriate, before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed.
Such measures will be non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services, including but not limited to a mutual directive to the parties to have no contact with each other (a ï¿½No Contact Directiveï¿½), changes to living arrangements, changes to class schedules, counseling, campus escort services, and other measures designed to restore or preserve access to the educational programs and activities, protect the safety of all parties and the educational environment, and to deter harassment and retaliation. Such measures will not be unduly burdensome to either party and will not require a fee or charge.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will implement supportive measures to the extent possible as appropriate and as reasonably available.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will keep supportive measures confidential to the extent that the confidentiality would not impair the ability of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to provide the supportive measures.
Upon completion of an individualized safety and risk analysis, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that a respondent poses an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or individual exists and make a recommendation to the VPSA for the emergency removal of the student due to the allegation(s) of sexual harassment. The VPSA may also complete the individualized health and safety risk analysis and remove the respondent. The respondent will be notified of the removal decision in writing and shall have an opportunity to challenge the removal decision pursuant to the Student Non-Academic Conduct Procedures.
Employees of the University may be placed on administrative leave during the pendency of the Title IX processes including the investigative process and hearing process.
The University takes all discrimination complaints seriously. However, knowingly filing a false complaint is considered serious misconduct and is also subject to sanction. An individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints that harass colleagues and/or abuse the complaint resolution process may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time. Such cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of University Senate Rules and Regulations section 6.5.4, Abuse of Grievance Process.
The process for responding to Title IX complaints may include informal resolution (which may include mediation, restorative justice, or other educational resolutions), formal investigations, or supportive measures (which are available during both informal resolutions and formal investigations). If the subject matter or issue of the complaint does not fall under this policy, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff may advise the complainant of other available procedures.
Complainants are encouraged to file their formal complaints within one hundred eighty (180) days of any occurrence of alleged discrimination. A formal complaint must be made while the complainant is still enrolled which the University of Kansas, intends to re-enroll in the University of Kansas, employed by the University of Kansas, or participating or attempting to participate in an education program of the University of Kansas.
The Title IX Coordinator, in their discretion, may file a signed formal complaint regarding the alleged violation of the Sexual Harassment Policy. Situations where the Title IX Coordinator might file a formal complaint include incidents involving weapons, incidents involving multiple respondents, situations where the respondent has multiple reports alleging violations of the sexual harassment policy, the complainant is a minor, or other situations where the Title IX Coordinator feels it is necessary to protect the campus community.
A report or formal complaint of sexual harassment or retaliation to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX should include the following, to the extent known and available:
Nature of the alleged sexual harassment (i.e., sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, stalking, or retaliation);
To remove barriers of reporting and participation in the investigative and hearing process under the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy, student parties including complainants, respondents, and witnesses shall not be subjected to discipline under the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities for the personal consumption of alcohol and/or drugs. The Director of Student Conduct and Community Standards may at their discretion assign educational interventions when there is concern regarding the safety of a student in connection to the studentï¿½s alcohol or drug use.
Upon receipt of a report, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly reach out to the complainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures with or without filing a formal complaint and explain to the complainant the process for filing a formal complaint as well as the opportunity to meet with the Title IX Coordinator. During the initial meeting, the complainant has the option of requesting supportive measures as well as filing a formal complaint. The complainant also has the option of requesting the University to take no further action on the report. When the complainant requests that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX take no action, the Title IX Coordinator reserves the right to file a signed formal complaint.
Upon receiving a formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall conduct an initial evaluation of the formal complaint and determine the appropriate action required. Where the University or its employees are accused of sexual harassment, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will contact the dean, director, administrator, supervisor, or chairperson responsible for the unit that is accused of sexual harassment to inform them of the filing of the formal complaint. When necessary, appropriate administrator(s) or faculty member(s) may be designated by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Vice Provost, Dean, Director, or Chairperson, by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or by the Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX to participate in the evaluation of the formal complaint and to facilitate necessary action.
In conducting its initial review of the formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may meet with the Complainant or take other steps to learn the basis of the formal complaint, including examining University records.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may dismiss a formal complaint if at any time during the investigation:
A complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein;
The complaint was filed when the complainant was not participating or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of the University; or
Specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.
If it is determined that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will not proceed with investigation of a formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will notify the complainant (if not anonymous) and respondent in writing explaining the reasons why the complaint is not being investigated under Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may notify the complainant that their formal complaint will be investigated under the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process or that the matter is being referred to another office for review. The notification letter will include a statement regarding the complainant and respondent right to appeal the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX decision if no formal investigation will occur under this policy.
A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy, and articulates sufficient facts, which if determined to be accurate, would support a finding that the University's Sexual Harassment Policy has been violated.
Respondents are presumed not to be responsible for the allegations of the complaint until a conclusion is reached at the end of the investigation.
The University will strive to complete investigations of formal complaints, including issuance of a report of findings to the complainant and respondent, in as timely and efficient a manner as possible within sixty (60) working days of receipt of a complaint. However, this timeframe may be extended based on factors such as, but not limited to, schedule and availability of witnesses, concurrent law enforcement activity, holidays or semester breaks including summer break, and complexity of the complaint. If an investigation cannot be completed within sixty (60) working days of receipt of the complaint, then the investigator(s) will notify the complainant and respondent the investigation timeframe is being extended and provide a timeframe for completing the investigation.
Investigators assigned to conduct an investigation will be impartial. In conducting investigations into violations of the Universityï¿½s Policies, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will use a preponderance of the evidence standard in making factual determinations. The preponderance of the evidence means the fact in dispute is more likely than not to be true. The investigation will include the following elements:
Contact with Complainant.ï¿½If the investigator did not speak with the complainant at the time that the formal complaint was received by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, then the investigator will meet or speak with the complainant at the start of the investigation and throughout the investigation as appropriate.
Notice to Respondent.ï¿½The respondent will be provided with a statement of the complaint in writing, and the complainant will be provided a copy of this notification. The notice will include:
That the respondent is presumed not to be responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination will be reached at the end of the investigation;
The respondentï¿½s right to an advisor (who may be an attorney) of the respondentï¿½s choice and to review all evidence gathered prior to the conclusion of the investigation; and
That University policies prohibit knowingly making false statement or submitting false information during the investigation process.
Respondents will be provided an opportunity to meet with the investigator(s) investigating the complaint and to respond to the allegation and to meet or speak with the investigator throughout the investigation as appropriate. Respondents may respond in person or in writing within a reasonable time to be determined by the investigators. If a respondent chooses not to participate or refuses to answer a complaint, the nonparticipation will not prevent the investigation from proceeding.
Notice regarding Retaliation.ï¿½All parties to a complaint (complainant, respondent, witnesses, and appropriate administrators or supervisors) will be informed that retaliation, defined in Section VI, by an individual or an individual's associates against any person who files a complaint or any person who participates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation are subject to disciplinary action.
Representation.ï¿½In any meeting with the investigators, the parties to the complaint (complainant and the respondent) may bring an advisor to the meeting, up to three (3). If the advisor is an attorney, the party must notify the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing at least three (3) working days before the meeting date.
Notice of all Meetings. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide to a party whose participation is invited or expected, written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purposes of all meetings including investigative interviews. Email is the primary form of written communication for the University of Kansas and the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide sufficient time to prepare to participate by allowing at least three (3) working-dayï¿½s notice unless the party requests a date and time allowing less than three (3) working days.
Information relevant to Investigation.ï¿½The complainant and respondent will be informed that they have the opportunity to identify witnesses, present witness statements, and submit any other evidence they believe relevant to resolution of the complaint. The investigator(s) will interview other persons whom, at the investigator(s)' discretion determines to be necessary to gather relevant information. The investigator(s) will review any written materials, e- mails, text messages, or other evidence that, at the investigator(s)ï¿½ discretion, may provide relevant information regarding the complaint. The burden of gathering evidence rests on the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.
Medical Records.ï¿½ No reports will be accessed, disclosed, or used that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in their capacity, or assisting in that capacity, which are made and maintained in connection to the treatment of the party without that partyï¿½s voluntary and written consent to do so.
Privileged Information.ï¿½ The investigator will not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding the privilege has waived the privilege.
Witness Summary.ï¿½ Witnesses may request, and Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide, a reasonable opportunity to review the investigatorï¿½s summary of that individualï¿½s interview and the opportunity to submit a written response to the summary.
Review of Evidence and Preliminary Report. Upon completion of the preliminary investigation report, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide the complainant and respondent, as well as the advisor of each party, an opportunity to inspect and review all evidence collected during the course of the investigation to include summaries of investigative interviews, physical evidence, inculpatory evidence, exculpatory evidence, and evidence upon which the investigator has collected but does not intend to rely. The complainant and respondent, and advisor to each party, will have ten (10) calendar days to submit a written response to the evidence. The investigator will consider the written responses prior to the completion of the final investigative report.
Final Investigative Report. After the end of the ten (10) calendar day period during which the complainant and respondent have the ability to review all evidence and preliminary report, the investigator will objectively evaluate all relevant evidence ï¿½ including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence ï¿½ and will draft a final investigative report. The investigative report will fairly summarize relevant evidence.
A copy of the final investigative report will be provided simultaneously to both parties, as well as the advisor for each party, and to the appropriate administrator(s).
The hearing panel is not bound by the relevance determinations in the investigative report and the final decision as to relevance shall be made by the Hearing Panel Chair.
Upon completion of the final investigative report, the report will be forwarded to the appropriate administrator(s) for the scheduling of a live hearing. The live hearing will be scheduled for no sooner than fourteen (14) calendar days. Live hearings will contain, at a minimum, the opportunity to cross exam parties through a partyï¿½s advisor. If a party does not have an advisor, one will be provided by the University for the live hearing. All live hearings will be subject to the Hearing Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Harassment.
No person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing. Disciplinary action, harassment, unsupported evaluations, or other adverse changes in the conditions of employment or the educational environment may also constitute retaliation. Retaliation will not be tolerated and could result in suspension, reassignment, salary reduction, termination, expulsion, or other disciplinary action. Formal complaints of retaliation related to investigations under the policy will be handled under the Title IX Resolution Process.
Nothing in this retaliation section limits the ability of the complainant and respondent to discuss the allegation under investigation or to gather and present relevant evidence. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute retaliation. Charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a grievance proceeding under this part does not constitute retaliation.
If a complainant or respondent believes that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX has erred in its decision to administratively close the complaint without a full investigation, that party may appeal the closure to the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, within seven (7) calendar days of the date of the notice of the investigator's findings. The request for an appeal must be a signed, written document articulating why the investigator's dismissal of the formal complaint is erroneous.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, shall notify the other party and the Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing of an appeal of the dismissal of formal complaint and allow the other party seven (7) calendar days to submit a written statement. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also be asked to submit a response or to provide additional information regarding the case.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, will respond to the appeal in writing to both complainant and respondent within twenty (20) calendar days of receiving the respondentï¿½s written statement or the conclusion of the seven (7) calendar days to submit a statement. This decision on appeal will constitute final agency action and there will be no further appeal within the University.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, will not conduct a new investigation of the Complaint or substitute their judgment for that of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. Rather, on appeal, the Complainant must show that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX has erred in one or more of the following ways and that the error caused actual prejudice to the outcome of the investigation:
There was procedural irregularity by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX that affected the outcome of the matter.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX improperly failed to gather or consider information relevant to the complaint.
Based upon the totality of the information in the record, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.
New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of the dismissal that could affect the outcome of the matter.
The Title IX Coordinator or investigator had a conflict of interest for or against complainants and respondents generally or the individual complainant and respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.
After submission of a formal complaint, either party may request an opportunity to resolve the complaint through an informal resolution process. If requested by one party, the other party must voluntarily agree to participate in order for the informal resolution process to proceed. A successful resolution and agreement of the parties will result in dismissal of the complaint without further investigation or hearing. Prior to reaching an agreement, either party may withdraw from the process and request that the grievance procedures pursuant to this policy resume.
An informal resolution process will be facilitated by an individual who is trained, unbiased and without conflict. The informal resolution process will be conducted in accordance with informal resolution procedures.
The informal resolution process is not available when the complaint alleges a violation by an employee against a student.
Members of the University community who are found to have violated the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy are subject to disciplinary actions appropriate to their status as faculty, staff, or student employees or as students. Disciplinary actions can range from a warning to a dismissal or termination. Disciplinary actions for students can be found in section VII of the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, disciplinary actions for faculty can be found in Article VI of the Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, and disciplinary actions for Staff can be found in the Disciplinary Action Policy for Staff.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will handle all discrimination and harassment complaints discreetly but cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity because the University has an obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment and to maintain a safe environment, free from harassment and discrimination. Because of its obligations under the law, KU will not be able to honor all requests for confidentiality or all requests that a complaint not be pursued.
Employees may file employment discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. Students may file discrimination complaints through the Office of Civil Rights in the U. S. Department of Education or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX can provide information about deadlines and filing procedures for the state and federal agencies.
The University will maintain all records of each sexual harassment investigation for a period of seven (7) years to include any determination regarding responsibility, any audio or audiovisual recording or transcript, any disciplinary sanctions imposed on the respondent, any remedies provided to the complainant designed to restore and preserve access to the Universityï¿½s educational programs or activities, any appeals and the results therefrom, and informal resolutions and the results therefrom, and all materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and any person who facilitates an informal resolution process.
For each report and formal complaint falling under this Title IX process, before closing the file, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall document all actions taken in response and all measures taken to restore or preserve access to educational programs and activities of the University. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX also shall document the basis for its conclusion that the Universityï¿½s response was not deliberately indifferent, and where no supportive measures have been provided, why the Universityï¿½s response was not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.
[1]ï¿½ The Universityï¿½s definition of ï¿½Sexual Assaultï¿½ is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.ï¿½ Those regulations require the University to adopt a definition of ï¿½Sexual Assaultï¿½ that incorporates various forcible and non-forcible sex crimes as defined by the FBIï¿½s Uniform Crime Reporting System.ï¿½ See 34 C.F.R. ï¿½ 106.30(a).

By following the recommended URL naming convention, we can ensure that the policy owner and subject for each document is easily identifiable.
You will always use the same Policy Owner prefix for your policies, and the only thing you will need to customize is what you will use for the policy title. We recommend using the most concise version of the policy name possible, excluding words such as ï¿½of, ï¿½ ï¿½the,ï¿½ ï¿½a,ï¿½ etc., and separating words with dashes.

Appropriate review and approval groups will likely be unique for each policy. Those groups will be determined based on the campus to which the policy will apply and the nature of the policy. The Policy Office is available to assist units developing and revising policy to determine the appropriate groups and contacts.
For policies that will apply to KUMC and reporting units (Wichita and Salina), please contact the appropriate units on that campus.
Service & ResponsibilityBy partnering with policy making units and individuals across the University,ï¿½the Office of Policy Administration functions as an institution-wide resource for policy and policy development. As stewards of the University Policy Program, Policy Administration is responsible for the maintenance and oversight of the Policy Library, the Universityï¿½s official archive for policy. We facilitate policy development, periodic review and revision, and approval, as well as publication in the Policy Library, using the Policy Development Process.The Office of Policy Administration assists units in implementing Kansas Board of Regents policy, achieving compliance with state and federal laws and regulations, and addressing institutional interests by promoting efficiency and effectiveness. We value collaboration with subject matter experts and units across the University and strive to make each policy development process as inclusive as possible to ensure that policies address institutional need and serve our campus community.
For more information about the development and promulgation of policies at KU, including definitions of key terms such as policy and procedure, as well as articulation of responsibilities, please see the University Policy Program.

By following the recommended URL naming convention, we can ensure that the policy owner and subject for each document is easily identifiable.
You will always use the same Policy Owner prefix for your policies, and the only thing you will need to customize is what you will use for the policy title. We recommend using the most concise version of the policy name possible, excluding words such as ï¿½of, ï¿½ ï¿½the,ï¿½ ï¿½a,ï¿½ etc., and separating words with dashes.

Appropriate review and approval groups will likely be unique for each policy. Those groups will be determined based on the campus to which the policy will apply and the nature of the policy. The Policy Office is available to assist units developing and revising policy to determine the appropriate groups and contacts.
For policies that will apply to KUMC and reporting units (Wichita and Salina), please contact the appropriate units on that campus.

PolicyPurpose:ï¿½To describe the process for resolution of complaints of discrimination on the basis of race (including racial harassment), religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual harassment, and sexual violence), disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity and gender expression.
Policy Statement:ï¿½In accordance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11246, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Jobs for Veterans Act of 2002, the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination and all other applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination statutes, the University of Kansas prohibits discrimination.
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, and genetic information in the university's programs and activities.ï¿½ Retaliation is also prohibited by university policy. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policies and are the Title IX coordinators for their respective campuses: Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, 913-588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas medical center campuses).
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, is committed to the full participation of previously excluded or neglected classes of people. Thus, it is also the policy of the university to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, and gender expression.
The university's nondiscrimination policy extends to employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions and all other educational programs and activities of the university and its affiliates. It also extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and an individual's associates that may arise as a result of a discrimination complaint. Leaders in the university community continuously examine all areas of the institution, make policy decisions, and implement strategies to eliminate and prevent discrimination wherever necessary.
The University of Kansas is committed to resolving discrimination complaints in a timely and effective manner and providing prompt corrective action if discrimination is believed to have occurred. The discrimination complaint resolution process is intended to provide effective resolution for complaints of discrimination on the basis of race (including racial harassment), religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual harassment, and sexual violence), disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran , sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity and gender expression. Affected persons, including students, faculty, staff, community members or others involved in university events or programs, may utilize the process to address complaints of discrimination related to University hiring and selection procedures, employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions, or University educational programs and activities.
Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a prohibited discriminatory practice at the University may contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.ï¿½Individuals who may use this procedure include, but are not limited to: individuals applying for enrollment or employment with the university; students; faculty, including those with visiting appointments; teaching or research assistants; postdoctoral research associates and fellows; university support staff and other unclassified employees; university administrators; and other persons receiving university services or participating in university programs. A person in the university community may ask that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX initiate an investigation of a specific matter. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when it has reason to believe that discriminatory or retaliatory action is occurring.
The process for resolving discrimination complaints may include some or all of the following actions: informal inquiry and discussion, mediation (except in cases of sexual harassment), disciplinary action, or other appropriate action. If the subject matter or issue of the complaint does not fall within the jurisdiction of this policy, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will advise the complainant of other available procedures.
In many cases, individuals will take appropriate corrective action when they are made aware of how their actions or behaviors are being perceived. If the complainant is comfortable doing so, the complainant may bring the concerns to the attention of the person responsible for the behavior or action. Complainants who choose not to address the discrimination directly on their own or through other informal processes may seek the assistance of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.ï¿½Complainants are encouraged to file their complaints within one hundred eighty (180) days of the most recent occurrence of the alleged discrimination.
Unit heads and others who serve in leadership roles in the university are responsible for nondiscrimination in their employment and academic environments. With the exceptions specified below, all employees at the University of Kansas are required to contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX at 785-864-6414 or civilrights@ku.edu to report incidents of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, of which they know or have reason to believe may have occurred.
For example, if a student shares information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, with a faculty or staff member, the faculty or staff member must report the information to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when appropriate and in the interests of the University to do so.
Health care providers and pastoral and professional counselors who receive information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, while acting in their role as a health care provider or pastoral or professional counselor are not required to report such information to Office of Civil Rights & Title IX; and
The CARE Coordinator, who is the employee designated to provide information about reporting options on a confidential basis.
The University Ombuds and Faculty Ombuds, who are employees designated to provide confidential assistance to persons seeking information about University policies and processes.
Employees who are exempt from reporting to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX still have an obligation to exercise reasonable care to protect a foreseeable victim from danger and to make reports mandated by law.ï¿½ In addition, exempt employees shall encourage individuals to report discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, to contact Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and the police.
Any individual who believes that they have been the subject of discrimination or retaliation, or a Dean, Director, Chairperson or other supervisor or administrator who has reason to believe that discrimination or retaliation may have occurred, should contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to initiate the filing of a complaint. A complaint should include the following, to the extent known and available:
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide the complainant with an acknowledgement of receipt within seven (7) working days and will include in that acknowledgement the web address where the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process can be found.
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall conduct an initial evaluation of the merits of the complaint and determine the appropriate investigatory action required. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will contact the dean, director, administrator, supervisor, or chairperson responsible for the unit to inform them of the filing of the complaint. When necessary, appropriate administrator(s) or faculty member(s) may be designated by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Vice Provost, Dean, Director, or Chairperson, by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or by the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to participate in the evaluation of the complaint and to facilitate necessary action.
A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy and articulates sufficient facts, which if determined to be accurate, would support a finding that the University's discrimination policies have been violated. Investigators assigned to conduct an investigation will be impartial. In conducting investigations into violations of the Universityï¿½s Policies, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will use a preponderance of the evidence standard in making factual determinations. A preponderance of the evidence standard means the fact in issue is more probably true than not.
The University will strive to complete discrimination complaint investigations, including issuance of a report of findings to the complainant and respondent, in as timely and efficient a manner as possible within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complaint. However, this timeframe may be extended based on factors such as, but not limited to, schedule and availability of witnesses, holidays or semester breaks including summer break, and complexity of the complaint. If an investigation cannot be completed within sixty (60) days of receipt of the complaint, then the investigator(s) will notify the complainant and respondent of that fact and provide a timeframe for completing the investigation.
Notice to Respondent. The respondent will be provided with a statement of the complaint in writing, and the complainant will be provided a copy of this notification. The respondent will be provided an opportunity to meet with the investigator(s) investigating the complaint and to respond to the allegation. Respondents may respond in person or in writing within a reasonable time to be determined by the investigators. If a respondent chooses not to participate or refuses to answer a complaint, the nonparticipation will not prevent the investigation from proceeding and could result in a finding based solely on the information provided by the complainant.
Notice regarding Retaliation. All parties to a complaint (complainant, respondent, witnesses, and appropriate administrators or supervisors) will be informed that retaliation by an individual or an individual's associates against any person who files a complaint or any person who participates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation are subject to disciplinary action.
Contact with Complainant. If the investigator did not speak with the complainant at the time that the complaint was received by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, then the investigator will meet or speak with the complainant at the start of the investigation and throughout the investigation as appropriate.
Representation. In any meeting with the investigators, the parties to the complaint (complainant and the respondent) may bring a representative to the meeting. If the representative is an attorney, the party must notify the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing at least three (3) working days before the meeting date.
Information relevant to Investigation. The parties to a complaint (complainant and respondent) will be informed that they have the opportunity to identify witnesses, present witness statements, and any other evidence they believe relevant to resolution of the complaint. The investigator(s) will interview other persons whom, at the investigator(s)' discretion determines to be necessary to gather relevant information. The investigator will review any written materials, e-mails or other media that, at the investigator's discretion may provide relevant information regarding the complaint.
Findings of Investigation. The investigator(s) will provide a written summary of their findings to the respondent and the complainant within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the investigation. In addition, the investigator(s) will provide a written report of the investigation findings and recommendations to the appropriate administrators within the University who will determine the appropriate action to be taken in light of the investigation findings and recommendations. The administrators will have twenty working days from receipt of the investigation findings and recommendations to determine, in consultation with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, an appropriate resolution(s). Upon making their decision, the administrator(s) will provide written notification of their decision to both the respondent and complainant.
Respondent, Finding of Discrimination or Retaliation with Imposition of Discipline. If formal disciplinary action is imposed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation, then a respondent may seek as follows:
Faculty member or an unclassified academic staff member. The affected employee may request a hearing before the University Judicial Board or the Faculty Rights Board, as determined by the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.2 and the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff.)
Student. The student may request a hearing in accordance with the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities. If the student does not request a hearing, the Vice Provost for Student Affairs will determine the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.9).
Graduate Teaching Assistant. A graduate teaching assistant may request a review in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the University of Kansas, the Kansas Board of Regents and the Kansas Association of Public Employees (representing graduate teaching assistants at the University of Kansas, Lawrence). (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.16).
Other Student Employees, including Graduate Research Assistants and Graduate Assistants. Other student employees, including graduate research assistants and graduate assistants, may request that a supervisor's decision be reviewed by the next-level administrator and/or may contact Human Resource Management for assistance at hrdept@ku.edu or 785-864-4946.
Unclassified Professional Staff Employee. An unclassified professional staff member may seek review of disciplinary actions as specified by University policy,ï¿½http://policy.ku.edu/hr/Disciplinary_Action_Policy_for_Staff.
University Support Staff Employee. A University Support Staff employee who is not serving an initial probationary period and has been suspended, demoted, or dismissed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation may appeal the sanction to the University Disciplinary Action Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in University policy, http://policy.ku.edu/provost/disciplinary-action-hearing-board-support-staff.
The University may not proceed with a complaint investigation under a variety of circumstances, for instance:
A complainant, even after contact and follow up with an investigator, fails to describe in sufficient detail the conduct that is the basis of the complaint;
If it is determined that the University will not proceed with investigation of a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will notify the complainant (if not anonymous) in writing explaining the reasons why the complaint is not being investigated. The notification letter will include a statement notifying the complainant that the complainant may appeal the determination not to proceed with an investigation of the complaint to the Vice Chancellor and Provost with ten (10) working days of the notice. The request for an appeal must be a signed, written document articulating why the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation was in error. The Vice Chancellor and Provost will respond to the request for appeal within twenty (20) working days of receipt of the appeal. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is upheld, then that decision will constitute final agency action and there is no further appeal within the University. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is overturned, the complaint will be sent back to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX for investigation in accordance with this procedure.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will make every reasonable attempt to adhere to the time limits set forth in these procedures. However, it is recognized that circumstances may necessitate an extension of time. Therefore, the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may extend the time limits set forth in these procedures.
Retaliation against persons who file discrimination complaints or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint, whether by an individual directly involved or by associates of the individual involved, is a violation of law and University policy. Complainants who utilize these procedures or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint should not be subjected to retaliation. Retaliation may take the form of unwanted personal contact from the respondent or giving additional assignments that are not assigned to others in similar situations, poor grades or unreasonable course assignments. Phone calls, e-mail or other attempts to discuss the complaint may be perceived as retaliation under certain circumstances. Disciplinary action, harassment, unsupported evaluations, or other adverse changes in the conditions of employment or the educational environment may also constitute retaliation. Retaliation will not be tolerated and could result in suspension, reassignment, salary reduction, termination, expulsion or other disciplinary action.
The University takes all discrimination complaints seriously. However, knowingly filing a false complaint is considered serious misconduct and is also subject to sanction. An individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints that harass colleagues and/or abuse the complaint resolution process may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time. Such cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of University Senate Rules and Regulations section 6.5.4, Abuse of Grievance Process.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will handle all discrimination and harassment complaints discreetly but cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity because the University has an obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment and to maintain a safe environment, free from harassment and discrimination. Because of its obligations under the law, KU will not be able to honor all requests for confidentiality or all requests that a complaint not be pursued.
However, complainants, respondents, witnesses, and any other parties involved in a complaint of discrimination shall refrain from disclosing information about a complaint of discrimination to anyone who does not have a legitimate, business need or right to know. Such disclosures are inappropriate and unprofessional and may result in disciplinary action. The foregoing does not preclude either party from seeking the advice or counsel of a supervisor, counselor, attorney, or other person in a similar role.
Employees may file employment discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. Students may file discrimination complaints through the Office of Civil Rights in the U. S. Department of Education or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX can provide information about deadlines and filing procedures for the state and federal agencies.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances:ï¿½In accordance with the Abuse of the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process section above and the provisions of the University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.5.4, an individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time.
Consequences:ï¿½Members of the University community who are found to have violated the University Nondiscrimination Policy are subject to disciplinary actions appropriate to their status as faculty, staff, or student employees or as students.

PolicyPurpose:ï¿½To describe the process for resolution of complaints of discrimination on the basis of race (including racial harassment), religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual harassment, and sexual violence), disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity and gender expression.
Policy Statement:ï¿½In accordance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11246, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Jobs for Veterans Act of 2002, the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination and all other applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination statutes, the University of Kansas prohibits discrimination.
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, and genetic information in the university's programs and activities.ï¿½ Retaliation is also prohibited by university policy. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policies and are the Title IX coordinators for their respective campuses: Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, 913-588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas medical center campuses).
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, is committed to the full participation of previously excluded or neglected classes of people. Thus, it is also the policy of the university to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, and gender expression.
The university's nondiscrimination policy extends to employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions and all other educational programs and activities of the university and its affiliates. It also extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and an individual's associates that may arise as a result of a discrimination complaint. Leaders in the university community continuously examine all areas of the institution, make policy decisions, and implement strategies to eliminate and prevent discrimination wherever necessary.
The University of Kansas is committed to resolving discrimination complaints in a timely and effective manner and providing prompt corrective action if discrimination is believed to have occurred. The discrimination complaint resolution process is intended to provide effective resolution for complaints of discrimination on the basis of race (including racial harassment), religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual harassment, and sexual violence), disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran , sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity and gender expression. Affected persons, including students, faculty, staff, community members or others involved in university events or programs, may utilize the process to address complaints of discrimination related to University hiring and selection procedures, employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions, or University educational programs and activities.
Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a prohibited discriminatory practice at the University may contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.ï¿½Individuals who may use this procedure include, but are not limited to: individuals applying for enrollment or employment with the university; students; faculty, including those with visiting appointments; teaching or research assistants; postdoctoral research associates and fellows; university support staff and other unclassified employees; university administrators; and other persons receiving university services or participating in university programs. A person in the university community may ask that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX initiate an investigation of a specific matter. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when it has reason to believe that discriminatory or retaliatory action is occurring.
The process for resolving discrimination complaints may include some or all of the following actions: informal inquiry and discussion, mediation (except in cases of sexual harassment), disciplinary action, or other appropriate action. If the subject matter or issue of the complaint does not fall within the jurisdiction of this policy, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will advise the complainant of other available procedures.
In many cases, individuals will take appropriate corrective action when they are made aware of how their actions or behaviors are being perceived. If the complainant is comfortable doing so, the complainant may bring the concerns to the attention of the person responsible for the behavior or action. Complainants who choose not to address the discrimination directly on their own or through other informal processes may seek the assistance of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.ï¿½Complainants are encouraged to file their complaints within one hundred eighty (180) days of the most recent occurrence of the alleged discrimination.
Unit heads and others who serve in leadership roles in the university are responsible for nondiscrimination in their employment and academic environments. With the exceptions specified below, all employees at the University of Kansas are required to contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX at 785-864-6414 or civilrights@ku.edu to report incidents of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, of which they know or have reason to believe may have occurred.
For example, if a student shares information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, with a faculty or staff member, the faculty or staff member must report the information to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when appropriate and in the interests of the University to do so.
Health care providers and pastoral and professional counselors who receive information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, while acting in their role as a health care provider or pastoral or professional counselor are not required to report such information to Office of Civil Rights & Title IX; and
The CARE Coordinator, who is the employee designated to provide information about reporting options on a confidential basis.
The University Ombuds and Faculty Ombuds, who are employees designated to provide confidential assistance to persons seeking information about University policies and processes.
Employees who are exempt from reporting to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX still have an obligation to exercise reasonable care to protect a foreseeable victim from danger and to make reports mandated by law.ï¿½ In addition, exempt employees shall encourage individuals to report discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, to contact Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and the police.
Any individual who believes that they have been the subject of discrimination or retaliation, or a Dean, Director, Chairperson or other supervisor or administrator who has reason to believe that discrimination or retaliation may have occurred, should contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to initiate the filing of a complaint. A complaint should include the following, to the extent known and available:
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide the complainant with an acknowledgement of receipt within seven (7) working days and will include in that acknowledgement the web address where the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process can be found.
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall conduct an initial evaluation of the merits of the complaint and determine the appropriate investigatory action required. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will contact the dean, director, administrator, supervisor, or chairperson responsible for the unit to inform them of the filing of the complaint. When necessary, appropriate administrator(s) or faculty member(s) may be designated by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Vice Provost, Dean, Director, or Chairperson, by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or by the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to participate in the evaluation of the complaint and to facilitate necessary action.
A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy and articulates sufficient facts, which if determined to be accurate, would support a finding that the University's discrimination policies have been violated. Investigators assigned to conduct an investigation will be impartial. In conducting investigations into violations of the Universityï¿½s Policies, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will use a preponderance of the evidence standard in making factual determinations. A preponderance of the evidence standard means the fact in issue is more probably true than not.
The University will strive to complete discrimination complaint investigations, including issuance of a report of findings to the complainant and respondent, in as timely and efficient a manner as possible within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complaint. However, this timeframe may be extended based on factors such as, but not limited to, schedule and availability of witnesses, holidays or semester breaks including summer break, and complexity of the complaint. If an investigation cannot be completed within sixty (60) days of receipt of the complaint, then the investigator(s) will notify the complainant and respondent of that fact and provide a timeframe for completing the investigation.
Notice to Respondent. The respondent will be provided with a statement of the complaint in writing, and the complainant will be provided a copy of this notification. The respondent will be provided an opportunity to meet with the investigator(s) investigating the complaint and to respond to the allegation. Respondents may respond in person or in writing within a reasonable time to be determined by the investigators. If a respondent chooses not to participate or refuses to answer a complaint, the nonparticipation will not prevent the investigation from proceeding and could result in a finding based solely on the information provided by the complainant.
Notice regarding Retaliation. All parties to a complaint (complainant, respondent, witnesses, and appropriate administrators or supervisors) will be informed that retaliation by an individual or an individual's associates against any person who files a complaint or any person who participates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation are subject to disciplinary action.
Contact with Complainant. If the investigator did not speak with the complainant at the time that the complaint was received by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, then the investigator will meet or speak with the complainant at the start of the investigation and throughout the investigation as appropriate.
Representation. In any meeting with the investigators, the parties to the complaint (complainant and the respondent) may bring a representative to the meeting. If the representative is an attorney, the party must notify the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing at least three (3) working days before the meeting date.
Information relevant to Investigation. The parties to a complaint (complainant and respondent) will be informed that they have the opportunity to identify witnesses, present witness statements, and any other evidence they believe relevant to resolution of the complaint. The investigator(s) will interview other persons whom, at the investigator(s)' discretion determines to be necessary to gather relevant information. The investigator will review any written materials, e-mails or other media that, at the investigator's discretion may provide relevant information regarding the complaint.
Findings of Investigation. The investigator(s) will provide a written summary of their findings to the respondent and the complainant within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the investigation. In addition, the investigator(s) will provide a written report of the investigation findings and recommendations to the appropriate administrators within the University who will determine the appropriate action to be taken in light of the investigation findings and recommendations. The administrators will have twenty working days from receipt of the investigation findings and recommendations to determine, in consultation with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, an appropriate resolution(s). Upon making their decision, the administrator(s) will provide written notification of their decision to both the respondent and complainant.
Respondent, Finding of Discrimination or Retaliation with Imposition of Discipline. If formal disciplinary action is imposed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation, then a respondent may seek as follows:
Faculty member or an unclassified academic staff member. The affected employee may request a hearing before the University Judicial Board or the Faculty Rights Board, as determined by the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.2 and the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff.)
Student. The student may request a hearing in accordance with the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities. If the student does not request a hearing, the Vice Provost for Student Affairs will determine the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.9).
Graduate Teaching Assistant. A graduate teaching assistant may request a review in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the University of Kansas, the Kansas Board of Regents and the Kansas Association of Public Employees (representing graduate teaching assistants at the University of Kansas, Lawrence). (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.16).
Other Student Employees, including Graduate Research Assistants and Graduate Assistants. Other student employees, including graduate research assistants and graduate assistants, may request that a supervisor's decision be reviewed by the next-level administrator and/or may contact Human Resource Management for assistance at hrdept@ku.edu or 785-864-4946.
Unclassified Professional Staff Employee. An unclassified professional staff member may seek review of disciplinary actions as specified by University policy,ï¿½http://policy.ku.edu/hr/Disciplinary_Action_Policy_for_Staff.
University Support Staff Employee. A University Support Staff employee who is not serving an initial probationary period and has been suspended, demoted, or dismissed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation may appeal the sanction to the University Disciplinary Action Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in University policy, http://policy.ku.edu/provost/disciplinary-action-hearing-board-support-staff.
The University may not proceed with a complaint investigation under a variety of circumstances, for instance:
A complainant, even after contact and follow up with an investigator, fails to describe in sufficient detail the conduct that is the basis of the complaint;
If it is determined that the University will not proceed with investigation of a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will notify the complainant (if not anonymous) in writing explaining the reasons why the complaint is not being investigated. The notification letter will include a statement notifying the complainant that the complainant may appeal the determination not to proceed with an investigation of the complaint to the Vice Chancellor and Provost with ten (10) working days of the notice. The request for an appeal must be a signed, written document articulating why the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation was in error. The Vice Chancellor and Provost will respond to the request for appeal within twenty (20) working days of receipt of the appeal. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is upheld, then that decision will constitute final agency action and there is no further appeal within the University. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is overturned, the complaint will be sent back to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX for investigation in accordance with this procedure.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will make every reasonable attempt to adhere to the time limits set forth in these procedures. However, it is recognized that circumstances may necessitate an extension of time. Therefore, the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may extend the time limits set forth in these procedures.
Retaliation against persons who file discrimination complaints or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint, whether by an individual directly involved or by associates of the individual involved, is a violation of law and University policy. Complainants who utilize these procedures or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint should not be subjected to retaliation. Retaliation may take the form of unwanted personal contact from the respondent or giving additional assignments that are not assigned to others in similar situations, poor grades or unreasonable course assignments. Phone calls, e-mail or other attempts to discuss the complaint may be perceived as retaliation under certain circumstances. Disciplinary action, harassment, unsupported evaluations, or other adverse changes in the conditions of employment or the educational environment may also constitute retaliation. Retaliation will not be tolerated and could result in suspension, reassignment, salary reduction, termination, expulsion or other disciplinary action.
The University takes all discrimination complaints seriously. However, knowingly filing a false complaint is considered serious misconduct and is also subject to sanction. An individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints that harass colleagues and/or abuse the complaint resolution process may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time. Such cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of University Senate Rules and Regulations section 6.5.4, Abuse of Grievance Process.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will handle all discrimination and harassment complaints discreetly but cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity because the University has an obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment and to maintain a safe environment, free from harassment and discrimination. Because of its obligations under the law, KU will not be able to honor all requests for confidentiality or all requests that a complaint not be pursued.
However, complainants, respondents, witnesses, and any other parties involved in a complaint of discrimination shall refrain from disclosing information about a complaint of discrimination to anyone who does not have a legitimate, business need or right to know. Such disclosures are inappropriate and unprofessional and may result in disciplinary action. The foregoing does not preclude either party from seeking the advice or counsel of a supervisor, counselor, attorney, or other person in a similar role.
Employees may file employment discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. Students may file discrimination complaints through the Office of Civil Rights in the U. S. Department of Education or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX can provide information about deadlines and filing procedures for the state and federal agencies.

Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a prohibited discriminatory practice at the University may contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.ï¿½Individuals who may use this procedure include, but are not limited to: individuals applying for enrollment or employment with the university; students; faculty, including those with visiting appointments; teaching or research assistants; postdoctoral research associates and fellows; university support staff and other unclassified employees; university administrators; and other persons receiving university services or participating in university programs. A person in the university community may ask that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX initiate an investigation of a specific matter. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when it has reason to believe that discriminatory or retaliatory action is occurring.
The process for resolving discrimination complaints may include some or all of the following actions: informal inquiry and discussion, mediation (except in cases of sexual harassment), disciplinary action, or other appropriate action. If the subject matter or issue of the complaint does not fall within the jurisdiction of this policy, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will advise the complainant of other available procedures.
In many cases, individuals will take appropriate corrective action when they are made aware of how their actions or behaviors are being perceived. If the complainant is comfortable doing so, the complainant may bring the concerns to the attention of the person responsible for the behavior or action. Complainants who choose not to address the discrimination directly on their own or through other informal processes may seek the assistance of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.ï¿½Complainants are encouraged to file their complaints within one hundred eighty (180) days of the most recent occurrence of the alleged discrimination.
Unit heads and others who serve in leadership roles in the university are responsible for nondiscrimination in their employment and academic environments. With the exceptions specified below, all employees at the University of Kansas are required to contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX at 785-864-6414 or civilrights@ku.edu to report incidents of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, of which they know or have reason to believe may have occurred.
For example, if a student shares information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, with a faculty or staff member, the faculty or staff member must report the information to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when appropriate and in the interests of the University to do so.
Health care providers and pastoral and professional counselors who receive information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, while acting in their role as a health care provider or pastoral or professional counselor are not required to report such information to Office of Civil Rights & Title IX; and
The CARE Coordinator, who is the employee designated to provide information about reporting options on a confidential basis.
The University Ombuds and Faculty Ombuds, who are employees designated to provide confidential assistance to persons seeking information about University policies and processes.
Employees who are exempt from reporting to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX still have an obligation to exercise reasonable care to protect a foreseeable victim from danger and to make reports mandated by law.ï¿½ In addition, exempt employees shall encourage individuals to report discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, to contact Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and the police.
Any individual who believes that they have been the subject of discrimination or retaliation, or a Dean, Director, Chairperson or other supervisor or administrator who has reason to believe that discrimination or retaliation may have occurred, should contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to initiate the filing of a complaint. A complaint should include the following, to the extent known and available:
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide the complainant with an acknowledgement of receipt within seven (7) working days and will include in that acknowledgement the web address where the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process can be found.
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall conduct an initial evaluation of the merits of the complaint and determine the appropriate investigatory action required. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will contact the dean, director, administrator, supervisor, or chairperson responsible for the unit to inform them of the filing of the complaint. When necessary, appropriate administrator(s) or faculty member(s) may be designated by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Vice Provost, Dean, Director, or Chairperson, by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or by the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to participate in the evaluation of the complaint and to facilitate necessary action.
A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy and articulates sufficient facts, which if determined to be accurate, would support a finding that the University's discrimination policies have been violated. Investigators assigned to conduct an investigation will be impartial. In conducting investigations into violations of the Universityï¿½s Policies, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will use a preponderance of the evidence standard in making factual determinations. A preponderance of the evidence standard means the fact in issue is more probably true than not.
The University will strive to complete discrimination complaint investigations, including issuance of a report of findings to the complainant and respondent, in as timely and efficient a manner as possible within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complaint. However, this timeframe may be extended based on factors such as, but not limited to, schedule and availability of witnesses, holidays or semester breaks including summer break, and complexity of the complaint. If an investigation cannot be completed within sixty (60) days of receipt of the complaint, then the investigator(s) will notify the complainant and respondent of that fact and provide a timeframe for completing the investigation.
Notice to Respondent. The respondent will be provided with a statement of the complaint in writing, and the complainant will be provided a copy of this notification. The respondent will be provided an opportunity to meet with the investigator(s) investigating the complaint and to respond to the allegation. Respondents may respond in person or in writing within a reasonable time to be determined by the investigators. If a respondent chooses not to participate or refuses to answer a complaint, the nonparticipation will not prevent the investigation from proceeding and could result in a finding based solely on the information provided by the complainant.
Notice regarding Retaliation. All parties to a complaint (complainant, respondent, witnesses, and appropriate administrators or supervisors) will be informed that retaliation by an individual or an individual's associates against any person who files a complaint or any person who participates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation are subject to disciplinary action.
Contact with Complainant. If the investigator did not speak with the complainant at the time that the complaint was received by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, then the investigator will meet or speak with the complainant at the start of the investigation and throughout the investigation as appropriate.
Representation. In any meeting with the investigators, the parties to the complaint (complainant and the respondent) may bring a representative to the meeting. If the representative is an attorney, the party must notify the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing at least three (3) working days before the meeting date.
Information relevant to Investigation. The parties to a complaint (complainant and respondent) will be informed that they have the opportunity to identify witnesses, present witness statements, and any other evidence they believe relevant to resolution of the complaint. The investigator(s) will interview other persons whom, at the investigator(s)' discretion determines to be necessary to gather relevant information. The investigator will review any written materials, e-mails or other media that, at the investigator's discretion may provide relevant information regarding the complaint.
Findings of Investigation. The investigator(s) will provide a written summary of their findings to the respondent and the complainant within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the investigation. In addition, the investigator(s) will provide a written report of the investigation findings and recommendations to the appropriate administrators within the University who will determine the appropriate action to be taken in light of the investigation findings and recommendations. The administrators will have twenty working days from receipt of the investigation findings and recommendations to determine, in consultation with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, an appropriate resolution(s). Upon making their decision, the administrator(s) will provide written notification of their decision to both the respondent and complainant.
Respondent, Finding of Discrimination or Retaliation with Imposition of Discipline. If formal disciplinary action is imposed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation, then a respondent may seek as follows:
Faculty member or an unclassified academic staff member. The affected employee may request a hearing before the University Judicial Board or the Faculty Rights Board, as determined by the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.2 and the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff.)
Student. The student may request a hearing in accordance with the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities. If the student does not request a hearing, the Vice Provost for Student Affairs will determine the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.9).
Graduate Teaching Assistant. A graduate teaching assistant may request a review in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the University of Kansas, the Kansas Board of Regents and the Kansas Association of Public Employees (representing graduate teaching assistants at the University of Kansas, Lawrence). (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.16).
Other Student Employees, including Graduate Research Assistants and Graduate Assistants. Other student employees, including graduate research assistants and graduate assistants, may request that a supervisor's decision be reviewed by the next-level administrator and/or may contact Human Resource Management for assistance at hrdept@ku.edu or 785-864-4946.
Unclassified Professional Staff Employee. An unclassified professional staff member may seek review of disciplinary actions as specified by University policy,ï¿½http://policy.ku.edu/hr/Disciplinary_Action_Policy_for_Staff.
University Support Staff Employee. A University Support Staff employee who is not serving an initial probationary period and has been suspended, demoted, or dismissed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation may appeal the sanction to the University Disciplinary Action Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in University policy, http://policy.ku.edu/provost/disciplinary-action-hearing-board-support-staff.
The University may not proceed with a complaint investigation under a variety of circumstances, for instance:
A complainant, even after contact and follow up with an investigator, fails to describe in sufficient detail the conduct that is the basis of the complaint;
If it is determined that the University will not proceed with investigation of a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will notify the complainant (if not anonymous) in writing explaining the reasons why the complaint is not being investigated. The notification letter will include a statement notifying the complainant that the complainant may appeal the determination not to proceed with an investigation of the complaint to the Vice Chancellor and Provost with ten (10) working days of the notice. The request for an appeal must be a signed, written document articulating why the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation was in error. The Vice Chancellor and Provost will respond to the request for appeal within twenty (20) working days of receipt of the appeal. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is upheld, then that decision will constitute final agency action and there is no further appeal within the University. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is overturned, the complaint will be sent back to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX for investigation in accordance with this procedure.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will make every reasonable attempt to adhere to the time limits set forth in these procedures. However, it is recognized that circumstances may necessitate an extension of time. Therefore, the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may extend the time limits set forth in these procedures.
Retaliation against persons who file discrimination complaints or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint, whether by an individual directly involved or by associates of the individual involved, is a violation of law and University policy. Complainants who utilize these procedures or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint should not be subjected to retaliation. Retaliation may take the form of unwanted personal contact from the respondent or giving additional assignments that are not assigned to others in similar situations, poor grades or unreasonable course assignments. Phone calls, e-mail or other attempts to discuss the complaint may be perceived as retaliation under certain circumstances. Disciplinary action, harassment, unsupported evaluations, or other adverse changes in the conditions of employment or the educational environment may also constitute retaliation. Retaliation will not be tolerated and could result in suspension, reassignment, salary reduction, termination, expulsion or other disciplinary action.
The University takes all discrimination complaints seriously. However, knowingly filing a false complaint is considered serious misconduct and is also subject to sanction. An individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints that harass colleagues and/or abuse the complaint resolution process may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time. Such cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of University Senate Rules and Regulations section 6.5.4, Abuse of Grievance Process.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will handle all discrimination and harassment complaints discreetly but cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity because the University has an obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment and to maintain a safe environment, free from harassment and discrimination. Because of its obligations under the law, KU will not be able to honor all requests for confidentiality or all requests that a complaint not be pursued.
However, complainants, respondents, witnesses, and any other parties involved in a complaint of discrimination shall refrain from disclosing information about a complaint of discrimination to anyone who does not have a legitimate, business need or right to know. Such disclosures are inappropriate and unprofessional and may result in disciplinary action. The foregoing does not preclude either party from seeking the advice or counsel of a supervisor, counselor, attorney, or other person in a similar role.
Employees may file employment discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. Students may file discrimination complaints through the Office of Civil Rights in the U. S. Department of Education or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX can provide information about deadlines and filing procedures for the state and federal agencies.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances:ï¿½In accordance with the Abuse of the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process section above and the provisions of the University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.5.4, an individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time.
Consequences:ï¿½Members of the University community who are found to have violated the University Nondiscrimination Policy are subject to disciplinary actions appropriate to their status as faculty, staff, or student employees or as students.

The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression and genetic information in the Universityï¿½s programs and activities. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the non-discrimination policies: Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS, 66045, (785)864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, (913) 588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas Medical Center campuses).
Sexual Harassment:ï¿½ï¿½Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment: ï¿½Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individualï¿½s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment: ï¿½Hostile Environment Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities.
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a mannerï¿½that does not interfere with First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employeeï¿½s official duties.ï¿½ Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employeeï¿½s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive.ï¿½ In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
Penetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.ï¿½ An ï¿½objectï¿½ or ï¿½instrumentï¿½ is anything used by the offender other than the offenderï¿½s genitalia.
Touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Domestic Violence: ï¿½Domestic Violenceï¿½ï¿½ is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that personï¿½s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.
Where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
Stalking: ï¿½Stalkingï¿½ is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.ï¿½ For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:
(A) Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a personï¿½s property.
(B) Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.
(C) Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.
1The Universityï¿½s definition of ï¿½Sexual Assaultï¿½ is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.ï¿½ Those regulations require the University to adopt a definition of ï¿½Sexual Assaultï¿½ that incorporates various forcible and non-forcible sex crimes as defined by the FBIï¿½s Uniform Crime Reporting System.ï¿½ See 34 C.F.R. ï¿½ 106.30(a).

ProcedurePurpose:ï¿½To articulate the Universityï¿½s procedures for resolving complaints of sexual harassment.
These hearing procedures apply to the resolution of Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment under the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy after such Formal Complaints have been investigated by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX pursuant to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX' Title IX Resolution Process.
A. Administrative Officeï¿½refers to the office within the University responsible for administering these procedures. The Administrative Office varies depending on the status of the Respondent (i.e., administrator; faculty; student; or staff/third party) as specified herein.
B. Administrative Officerï¿½refers to an individual designated by the Administrative Office to coordinate the logistics of these procedures in collaboration with the Hearing Chair.
C. Advisorï¿½refers to an individual of a partyï¿½s choosing who provides emotional support to a party; assists the party in preparing for the hearing; attends pre-hearing meetings with the party; and who conducts questioning on behalf of a party at the hearing. An advisor may, but does not have to be, an attorney. The role of the Advisor is further explained herein.
D. Complainantï¿½refers to the individual who is alleged to be the victim of the alleged Sexual Harassment stated in the Formal Complaint.
E. Formal Complaintï¿½refers to a Formal Complaint as defined in the Office of Civil Rights & Title IXï¿½s Title IX Resolution Process.
F. Hearing Chairï¿½refers to a single individual who oversees and administers the prehearing procedures, hearing, deliberation, and determination. The Hearing Chair, together with the Hearing Panel, resolves disputed facts under a preponderance of the evidence standard and determines whether those facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint.
G. Hearing Panel refers to two individuals who, together with the Hearing Chair, receive evidence at the hearing, resolve disputed facts under a preponderance of the evidence standard, and determine whether those facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint.
H. Relevant Evidenceï¿½is that evidence which has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and where the fact is of consequence in determining the allegations of Sexual Harassment at issue in a Formal Complaint. Some evidence, such as certain evidence of a Complainantï¿½s sexual history, is categorically excluded as irrelevant, as further specified herein.
I. Respondentï¿½refers to the individual who is alleged to have perpetrated the alleged Sexual Harassment stated in the Formal Complaint.
J.ï¿½Sexual Harassmentï¿½refers to Sexual Harassment as defined in the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy, including Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking as those terms are defined in the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy.
At the conclusion of its Title IX Resolution Process, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will transmit a copy of its final investigation report, together with all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint, to the Administrative Office. The Administrative Office responsible for administering these procedures varies based on the status of the Respondent. The relevant offices are:
Upon receipt of the investigation report and evidence, the Administrative Office will appoint an Administrative Officer who shall thereafter be responsible for coordinating the selection of a Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, assisting the Hearing Chair in arranging the pre-hearing conference and hearing, and ensuring an appropriate record of the proceedings is made.
The University will maintain a pool of up to six suitably qualified individuals to serve as Hearing Chairs under these procedures. The pool shall include individuals reflective of the diversity of the University community.
Such individuals shall have experience in the conduct of administrative proceedings, the presentation of evidence, ruling on the admissibility of evidence, administering deliberations, and drafting written decisions. All Hearing Chairs shall also receive training from the University on the Universityï¿½s definition of Sexual Harassment; the scope of the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities; how to conduct the various procedures and hearing specified herein; how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias; relevance of questions and evidence, including when questions and evidence about a Complainantï¿½s sexual history are not relevant; and training on any audio or video technology that may be used to effectuate the pre-hearing conference or hearing.
The Administrative Officer shall select a member of the pool to serve as Hearing Chair giving due regard to factors such as the individualï¿½s availability to promptly conduct a hearing; the individualï¿½s general familiarity with the particular aspect of the Universityï¿½s operations from which the Formal Complaint arose; potential conflicts of interest that may exist based on the identity of the parties or subject matter involved; and the relative equal distribution of cases across the pool.
After the Administrative Officer selects the Hearing Chair, the Administrative Officer will provide the parties with written notice of the Hearing Chairï¿½s selection. Such notice shall advise the parties that they have three days from receipt of the notice to advise the Administrative Officer of any objection to the selected Hearing Chair based on a claimed conflict of interest or bias.
If any party claims a conflict of interest or bias on the part of the selected Hearing Chair, the Administrative Officer shall determine whether, in fact, such a conflict of interest or bias exists. If the Administrative Officer determines a conflict of interest or bias exists, the Administrative Officer shall select a new Hearing Chair and provide the parties with written notice as specified in this section. If the Administrative Officer determines that a conflict of interest or bias does not exist, the Administrative Officer shall notify the parties in writing, and the matter will proceed with the identified Hearing Chair.
After the selection of the Hearing Chair, and prior to the selection of a Hearing Panel, the Hearing Chair, in consultation with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and the Administrative Officer, will review the final investigation report, together with all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint, and determine whether the Formal Complaint should be dismissed for any one or more of the following grounds:
The Complainant has provided the Title IX Coordinator written notice that the Complainant wishes to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed);
Specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint, or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed).
In the event the Hearing Chair determines that a Formal Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to this section, the Hearing Chair will provide written notice of dismissal to the parties and advise them of their right to appeal as specified herein. The Hearing Chair may refer the dismissed allegations for resolution by other University offices, as appropriate.
If the Formal Complaint is not dismissed, the Administrative Officer shall select two individuals to serve as the Hearing Panel. At least one of the two individuals selected must share the same status as the Respondent (i.e., faculty, student, or staff). Such individuals shall be selected giving due regard to factors such as the individualï¿½s availability to promptly participate in a hearing; the individualï¿½s general familiarity with the particular aspect of the Universityï¿½s operations from which the Formal Complaint arose; potential conflicts of interest that may exist based on the identity of the parties or subject matter involved; and the relative equal distribution of cases across the pool.
Such individuals shall be drawn from a pool of suitably qualified individuals. The pool shall include students, faculty, and staff. Student members shall be appointed by the Vice Provost for Student Affairs in consultation with the Student Senate President. Faculty members shall be appointed by the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor in consultation with the Faculty Senate President. Staff members shall be appointed by the Vice Provost for Operations in consultation with the Staff Senate President.
The pool shall include individuals reflective of the diversity of the University community, including individuals from various schools and departments. Such individuals shall receive training from the University on the Universityï¿½s definition of Sexual Harassment; the scope of the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities; the individualï¿½s role at the hearing as specified herein; how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias; relevance of questions and evidence, including when questions and evidence about a Complainantï¿½s sexual history are not relevant; and training on any audio or video technology that may be used to effectuate the pre-hearing conference or hearing.
After the Administrative Officer selects the Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer will provide the parties with written notice of the Hearing Panelï¿½s selection. Such notice shall advise the parties that the parties have three days from receipt of the notice to advise the Administrative Officer of any objection a party may have based on a claimed conflict of interest or bias.
If any party claims a conflict of interest or bias on the part of a member of the selected Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer shall determine whether, in fact, such a conflict of interest or bias exists. If the Administrative Officer determines a conflict of interest or bias exists, the Administrative Officer shall select a new member of the Hearing Panel and provide the parties with written notice as specified in this section. If the Administrative Officer determines that a conflict of interest or bias does not exist, the Administrative Officer shall notify the parties, in writing, and the matter will proceed with the identified Hearing Panel.
After the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel are selected, the Administrative Officer will send written notice to the parties notifying them of the deadline for the parties to submit any written response to the investigation report; a date for the pre-hearing conference; and a date and time for the hearing (to including an anticipated length in hours). Neither the pre-hearing conference, nor the hearing itself, may be held any earlier than fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of transmittal of the written notice specified in this section.
To the extent the party disagrees with the investigation report, any argument or commentary regarding such disagreement;
Any evidence that a party did not have a reasonable opportunity to provide during the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigation or that the party believes was improperly excluded by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX;
Any argument that evidence should be categorically excluded from consideration at the hearing based on privilege, relevancy, the prohibition on the use of sexual history specified herein, or for any other reason;
A list of any witnesses that the party contends should be called to attend the hearing pursuant to an attendance notice issued by the Administrative Officer;
A list of any witnesses that the party intends to bring to the hearing without an attendance notice issued by the Hearing Chair;
The name and contact information of the Advisor who will accompany the party at the pre-hearing conference and hearing;
If the party does not have an Advisor who will accompany the party at the hearing, a request that the University provide an Advisor for purposes of assisting the party in preparing for the hearing and conducting questioning at the hearing.
Argument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint are supported by a preponderance of the evidence; and
Prior to the hearing, the Hearing Chair will conduct a pre-hearing conference with the parties and their Advisors. By default, the pre-hearing conference will be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology. However, upon request of either party, or in the Hearing Chairï¿½s discretion, the pre-hearing conference may take the form of separate, sequential meetings between the Hearing Chair and each party, whether conducted virtually or in-person.
During the pre-hearing conference, the Hearing Chair will discuss the hearing procedures with the parties; address matters raised in the partiesï¿½ written responses to the investigation report, as the Hearing Chair deems appropriate; discuss whether any stipulations may be made to expedite the hearing; discuss the witnesses the parties have requested be served with notices of attendance and/or witnesses the parties plan to bring to the hearing without a notice of attendance; and resolve any other matters that the Hearing Chair determines, in the Hearing Chairï¿½s discretion, should be resolved before the hearing.
After the pre-hearing conference, the Administrative Officer will transmit notices of attendance to any University employee (i.e. administrator, faculty, or staff) or student whose attendance is requested at the hearing as a witness. The notice will request the subject to appear at the hearing at the specified date and time and advise the subject to contact the Administrative Officer immediately if there is a scheduling conflict.
The subject of an attendance notice should notify any manager, faculty member, coach, or other supervisor, as necessary, if attendance at the hearing will conflict with job duties, classes, or other obligations. All such managers, faculty members, coaches, and other supervisors will be encouraged to excuse the subject of the obligation, or provide some other accommodation, so that the subject may attend the hearing as specified in the notice.
The University has no control over the schedule or availability of any witness who is not an employee or a student, and a notice of attendance will not be issued to anyï¿½ such third-party individual. The University also does not have the authority to compel the attendance and testimony of student witnesses.
Prior to commencement of the hearing, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will review the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX's final investigation report and all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. This review of materials is provisional and intended to provide background and orientation to the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel in preparing for the hearing. The Hearing Chair must eventually exclude from consideration in deliberation any evidence developed during the investigation that is deemed inadmissible at the hearing.
The purpose of the hearing is for the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel to receive relevant testimonial and non-testimony evidence; to resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence standard; and to determine whether the facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations in the Formal Complaint as a violation of the Sexual Harassment Policy. The hearing will operate from a presumption that the Respondent is not responsible for the alleged misconduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made final.
The hearing is not a formal judicial proceeding and strict rules of evidence do not apply except as otherwise set forth in these procedures and as requried by law.
The Administrative Officer will assist the Hearing Chair in arranging the logistics of the hearing including, but not limited to, securing a suitable space on campus, if the hearing is to be held in person or to secure access to appropriate technology if the hearing is to be held virtually. The Administrative Officer will also ensure that the hearing (but not deliberation) is audio or video recorded.
The hearing will be conducted live, with simultaneous and contemporaneous participation by the parties and their Advisors. By default, the hearing will be conducted with the Hearing Chair, Hearing Panel, the parties, the Advisors, witnesses, and other necessary University personnel together in the same physical location. However, upon request of either party, the parties will be separated into different rooms with technology enabling the parties to participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by video and audio.
In the Hearing Chairï¿½s discretion, the hearing may be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology.
The Hearing Chair oversees the hearing process, rules on questions of relevance and admissibility, resolves all procedural disputes, questions parties and witnesses, and deliberates and votes with the Hearing Panel to determine responsibility for the allegations in the Formal Complaint at the conclusion of the hearing process. The Hearing Chair is responsible for maintaining decorum and professionalism in the hearing. The Hearing Chair has discretion to interpret and apply these procedures in any manner that is not clearly unreasonable and is consistent with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulation.
The Hearing Panel reviews the investigation report and hearing files in advance of the hearing, questions parties and witnesses when invited to do so by the Hearing Chair, and deliberates and votes with the Hearing Chair to determine responsibility for the allegations in the Formal Complaint at the conclusion of the hearing process.
The hearing is closed to all persons except the parties, their Advisors, the investigator, the Hearing Chair, the Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer, and other necessary University personnel as determined by the Hearing Chair. With the exception of the investigator and the parties, witnesses will be sequestered until such time as their testimony is complete.
Immediately prior to convening the hearing, the Hearing Chair will ensure that an audio or video recording of the hearing is being made by the Administrative Officer and that the hearing room is cleared of all individuals who are not permitted to be present during the hearing. The Hearing Chair will thenï¿½ convene the hearing and clearly state for the record the date, time, and location of the hearing; the names of the Complainant and Respondent; the parties present at the hearing; any accommodations that have been provided at the request of a party or in theï¿½ Universityï¿½s discretion; whether all or a portion of the hearing is being conducted virtually; and any other introductory matters that the Hearing Chair deems appropriate.
After convening the hearing, the Hearing Chair will call the investigator to give an overview of the investigation process. Thereafter, the investigator will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from each partyï¿½s Advisor commencing first with questioningï¿½ from the Advisor for the Complainant followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent. The investigator will not provide testimony about credibility or whether the investigator believes that the facts support a finding that a policy violation has or has not occurred.
After questioning of the investigator is complete, the Hearing Chair will invite the Complainant to provide a statement regarding the events in question and identify and comment on any non-testimonial evidence the Complainant believes is relevant. After the Complainant has made a statement, or waivedï¿½ the right to make a statement, the Complainant will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent.
After questioning of the Complainant is complete, the Hearing Chair will invite the Respondent to provide a statement to the Hearing Chair regarding the events in question and to identify and comment on any non-testimonial evidence the Respondent believes is relevant. After the Respondent has made a statement, or waived the right to make a statement, the Respondent will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Complainant.
After questioning of the parties is complete, witnesses will be called to testify in the order determined by the Hearing Chair. Unlike the parties, witnesses will not be invited to make a statement but, instead, will be subject to questioning from the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from each partyï¿½s Advisor commencing first with questioning from the Advisor for the Complainant followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent.
After the questioning of the parties and witnesses is complete, the Hearing Chair will identify any portion of the evidence developed during the investigation that the Hearing Chair has determined should be excluded from the hearing record based on rulings made at the pre-hearing conference, during the hearing itself, or for any other reason. The Hearing Chair will then provide the parties a final opportunity to raise any additional objections to inclusion of any other portions of the investigation record into evidence andï¿½ resolve any such objections. All evidence from the investigation and hearing not specifically excluded by the Hearing Chair shall be deemed admitted into the hearing record and may be considered by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel as part of the deliberation.
After the Hearing Chair has ruled on the exclusion of any evidence developed during the investigation, the Hearing Chair will invite the Complainant to make a closing argument. After the Complainant has made a closing argument, or waived the right to make a closing argument, the Hearing Chair will invite the Respondent to make a closing argument.
After closing arguments are complete, the Hearing Chair will conclude the hearing. Thereafter, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will enter into deliberation, which shall be closed to all other persons with the exception of the Universityï¿½s legal counsel, whom the Hearing Chair may invite for the purpose of providing advice to the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel.
During the hearing, the parties and their Advisors shall have access to the investigation report and a copy of all evidence developed by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigation directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. Such evidence may be utilized in the questioning of witnesses where relevant. Non-testimonial evidence utilized during the hearing shall be marked and referred to in such a manner as to make it clearly identifiable by audio (i.e., such as sequential marking of ï¿½exhibitsï¿½).
Throughout the hearing, the Hearing Chair will independently and contemporaneously screen all questions for relevance and resolve any contemporaneous evidentiary objections raised by the parties. If the Hearing Chair does not exclude a question, it is presumed the Hearing Chair has deemed the question relevant and admissible. The Hearing Chair may exclude evidence that is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative.
The Hearing Chair will have discretion to set the overall length of the hearing and may set time limits for statements of the parties, questioning of parties and witnesses, and closing arguments. A hearing will not exceed seven hours in length absent extraordinary circumstances. Once a hearing is commenced, it will be continued to another day only for good cause as determined by the Hearing Chair. The Hearing Chair has discretion to schedule breaks during the hearing.
In accordance with University Senate Code Article XII, during the pre-hearing conference and hearing, the Complainant and Respondent have the right to be represented by an Advisor or Counsel of their choice at their own cost and expense.
In the event a party is not able to secure an Advisor or Counsel to attend the hearing and conduct cross-examination of witnesses on behalf of that party, the University will provide the party an Advisor, without fee or charge, to conduct questioning on behalf of witnesses on behalf of the party at the hearing. The University will have sole discretion to select the Advisor it provides, but may consider input from the party. The Advisor the University provides may be, but is not required to be, an attorney.
The University is not required to provide a party with an Advisor in any circumstance except where the party does not have an Advisor present at the hearing. Except for conducting the questioning of witnesses during the hearing, an Advisor assigned by the University will play a passive role and is not permitted to communicate on behalf of a party, insist that communication flow through the Advisor, or communicate with the University about the matter. University-appointed Advisors are not permitted to make objections, present arguments, or engage in any other active role apart from questioning of witnesses.
In addition to an advisor of their choice, a party may be accompanied to the hearing by up to two support persons of their choice, provided a support person cannot be a witness. The support persons play a passive role and are not permitted to communicate on behalf of a party, insist that communication flow through the support person, or communicate with the University about the matter. Support persons are not permitted to make objections, present arguments, or engage in any active role.
During the hearing, evidence regarding a Complainantï¿½s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainantï¿½s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainantï¿½s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Complainant who affirmatively uses information otherwise considered irrelevant by this section may be deemed to have waived the protections of this section.
During the hearing, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel are not permitted to access, consider, disclose, permit questioning concerning, or otherwise use the following types of records unless the party holding the privilege has provided prior, written consent:
A partyï¿½s records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professional or paraprofessionalï¿½s capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party; or
Information or records protected from disclosure by any other legally recognized privilege, such as the attorney client privilege.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party who affirmatively uses information otherwise protected by this section may be deemed to have waived the protections of this section.
All parties, Advisors, and other persons present at a hearing are required to act professionally, maintain decorum, and abide by the policy, these procedures, and any other rules specified by the Hearing Chair. The requirements of professionalism and decorum apply to all aspects of the hearing, including the manner in which questions are posed to parties and witnesses. Any party, Advisor, or other person who materially disrupts the proceeding or violates applicable policies, procedures, and rules, may be barred from further participation and/or have their participation limited, as the case may be, by the Hearing Chair.
Wherever these procedures contemplate questioning of a party or witnesses, the Hearing Chair has discretion to permit more than one round of questioning. In addition to ruling on questions of relevancy, the Hearing Chair may limit cumulative and redundant questioning.
After the hearing is complete, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will privately deliberate over the matter. The deliberation will not be audio or video recorded. The deliberation will include an objective evaluation of all relevant evidence collected during the investigation, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, together with testimonial and non-testimonial evidence received at the hearing. While deliberating, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will ensure that any credibility determinations made are not based on a personï¿½s status as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness. The Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will take care to exclude from consideration any evidence that was ruled inadmissible at the pre-hearing conference, during the hearing, or by other operation of these procedures, or as required by law.
In deciding what the facts are, the Hearing Panel will decide what testimony and evidence it believes and what testimony and evidence it does not believe. The Hearing Panel may believe all of what a witness said, or only part of it, or none of it.
In deciding what testimony to believe, the Hearing Panel should consider the opportunity the witness had to have seen or heard the things testified about, the witness' memory, any motives that witness may have for testifying a certain way, the manner of the witness while testifying, whether that witness said something different at an earlier time, the general reasonableness of the testimony, and the extent to which the testimony is consistent with any other evidence that is believed.
In deciding whether or not to believe a witness, the Hearing Panel should consider that people sometimes hear or see things differently and sometimes forget things and therefore should consider whether a contradiction is an innocent misrecollection or lapse of memory or an intentional falsehood, and that may depend on whether it has to do with an important fact or only a small detail.
The Hearing Panel shall draw no inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a partyï¿½s or witnessï¿½s absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions. However, the hearing panel may consider in determining the weight of the evidence the extent to which the witnessï¿½ testimony or other evidence has been subject to cross-examination, particularly on matters that are material to the outcome of the case.
The Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., ï¿½more likely than notï¿½) standard and reach a determination regarding whether the facts that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. In the deliberation, the Hearing Chair and each member of the Hearing Panel have one vote. Abstentions are not permitted. A majority vote controls.
In the event the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel determine that the Respondent is responsible for violating the Sexual Harassment Policy the Hearing Chair will, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with the appropriate administrator with disciplinary authority over the Respondent and such administrator will determine any discipline to be imposed. The Hearing Chair will also, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with the Title IX Coordinator who will determine whether and to what extent ongoing support measures or other remedies will be provided to the Complainant.
After reaching a determination and consulting with the appropriate University administrator and Title IX Coordinator, the Hearing Chair will prepare a written decision that will include:
Identification of the allegations potentially constituting Sexual Harassment made in the Formal Complaint;
A description of the procedural steps taken by the University upon receipt of the Formal Complaint, through issuance of the written decision, including notification to the parties, interviews with the parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather non-testimonial evidence, and the date, location, and people who were present at or presented testimony at the hearing;
Articulate findings of fact, made under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that support the determination;
A statement of, and rationale for, each allegation that constitutes a separate potential incident of Sexual Harassment, including a determination regarding responsibility for each separate potential incident;
The discipline determined by the appropriate University administrator and any ongoing support measures or other remedies as determined by the Title IX Coordinator; and
The written determination will be signed by the Hearing Chair on behalf of the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel. The written determination will then be transmitted by the Administrative Officer to the parties, the Administrative Officer, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, and other University officials, as appropriate. Transmittal of the written determination to the parties concludes the hearing process, subject to any right of appeal. In a typical case, the written determination will be transmitted within fourteen (14) days of completion of the hearing, but this time period may vary depending on a range of factors including the complexity of the allegations at issue.
Either party may appeal the dismissal of a Formal Complaint or written determination, as the case may be, to an appeals panel of the University Judicial Board. Appeal is permitted one or more of the following grounds, in addition to those grounds specified in University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.7.3.:
There is new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination or dismissal was made, that could have affected the outcome;
The Title IX Coordinator, investigator, Hearing Chair, or Hearing Panel, as the case may be, had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or against the individual Complainant or Respondent, that affected the outcome;
The party was deprived of a right guaranteed by some other University policy or standard and the deprivation of that right affected the outcome.
A party must file an appeal within fourteen (14) days of the date they receive notice of dismissal or written determination appealed from. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Chair of the University Judicial Board. If an appeal is untimely or fails to invoke one or more of the permitted grounds for appeal, it will be dismissed.
If a timely appeal is filed invoking one or more of the permitted grounds, it shall be processed and heard in the manner specified in USRR Article VI, Section 7.
The determination of a Formal Complaint becomes final when the time for appeal has passed with no party filing an appeal or, if any appeal is filed, at the point when the University has resolved all appeals, either by dismissal or by transmittal of a written decision from the appeals panel. No further review or appeal is permitted beyond appeal to the University Judicial Board as specified herein.
The Title IX Coordinator, Administrative Officer, Hearing Chair, Hearing Panel, and appeals panel will be free of any conflicts of interest or bias. Any party who believes one or more of these individuals has a material conflict of interest or material bias must raise the concern promptly so that the University may evaluate the concern and find a substitute, if appropriate. The failure of a party to timely raise a concern of a conflict of interest or bias may result in a waiver of the issue.
Parties are expected to raise any objections, concerns, or complaints about the processes specified herein in a prompt and timely manner so that the University may evaluate the matter and address it, if appropriate. The failure of a party to timely raise an objection, concern, or complaint may result in a waiver of the issue.
The recording of the hearing will be made only by the University and is considered property of the University, subject to any right of access that a party may have under this policy, FERPA, and other applicable federal, state, or local laws. Only the University is permitted to make a recording of the hearing. The surreptitious recording of any meeting, interview, hearing, or other interaction contemplated by these procedures is prohibited. Any party who wishes to transcribe a hearing by use of a transcriptionist must seek preapproval from theï¿½ Administrative Officer.
It is a violation of these procedures for any person to provide testimony or other evidence that the person knows to be false or in bad faith.
The University retains discretion to interpret and apply these procedures in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable, even if the Universityï¿½s interpretation or application differs from the interpretation of the parties.
Despite the Universityï¿½s reasonable efforts to anticipate all eventualities in drafting these procedures, it is possible unanticipated or extraordinary circumstances may not be specifically or reasonably addressed by the express policy language, in which case the University retains discretion to respond to the unanticipated or extraordinary circumstance in a way that is not clearly unreasonable.
These procedures are not contractual in nature. Accordingly, the University retains discretion to revise these procedures at any time, and for any reason. The University may apply revisions to an active case provided that doing so is not clearly unreasonable.

Approved by:ï¿½ChancellorApproved on:ï¿½Friday, January 1, 1982Effective on:ï¿½Friday, January 1, 1982Review Cycle:ï¿½Annual (As Needed)Related statutes, regulations, and/or policies:ï¿½University of Kansas Combined Notice of Nondiscrimination
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression and genetic information in the Universityï¿½s programs and activities. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the non-discrimination policies: Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS, 66045, (785)864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, (913) 588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas Medical Center campuses).
Sexual Harassment:ï¿½ï¿½Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment: ï¿½Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individualï¿½s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment: ï¿½Hostile Environment Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities.
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a mannerï¿½that does not interfere with First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employeeï¿½s official duties.ï¿½ Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employeeï¿½s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive.ï¿½ In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
Penetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.ï¿½ An ï¿½objectï¿½ or ï¿½instrumentï¿½ is anything used by the offender other than the offenderï¿½s genitalia.
Touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Domestic Violence: ï¿½Domestic Violenceï¿½ï¿½ is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that personï¿½s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.
Where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
Stalking: ï¿½Stalkingï¿½ is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.ï¿½ For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:
(A) Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a personï¿½s property.
(B) Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.
(C) Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.
1The Universityï¿½s definition of ï¿½Sexual Assaultï¿½ is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.ï¿½ Those regulations require the University to adopt a definition of ï¿½Sexual Assaultï¿½ that incorporates various forcible and non-forcible sex crimes as defined by the FBIï¿½s Uniform Crime Reporting System.ï¿½ See 34 C.F.R. ï¿½ 106.30(a).
09/16/2014: Corrected two non-working links to the IOA web page on Sexual Harassment in Policy Statement and Related Other sections.
02/18/2012: Added definitions of ï¿½sexual harassmentï¿½ and ï¿½sexual violenceï¿½ and added link to KU Sexual Harassment web page.

Applies to:ï¿½All persons with a tenured, tenure-track, or non-tenured faculty appointment; unclassified academic staff; and any person hired by the University to conduct classroom activities.
This code shall be known as the Code of Faculty Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct. This code is based on the premise that both administrators and faculty share responsibility to create a climate suitable for scholarship, research, effective teaching and learning, and service. Except as otherwise provided by federal or state law, Board of Regents Policy, or provisions of the University Senate Code, University Senate Rules and Regulations, and Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations, no policy or action by the University or its faculty and staff may violate the rights, responsibilities, and standards of conduct established by this code. Substantive changes to this Code will be made only after approval by the Provostï¿½s Office and Faculty Senate, subject to the ultimate authority of the Chancellor, as defined in KSA 76.714,715, and 725.
The term ï¿½Universityï¿½ means the University of Kansas, and collectively, those responsible for its control and operation.
The term ï¿½studentï¿½ includes all persons taking courses at the institution, both full-time and part-time, pursuing undergraduate, graduate or extension studies.
The term "faculty member" includes all persons with a tenured, tenure-track, or non-tenured faculty appointment; unclassified academic staff; and any person hired by the University to conduct classroom activities. Determination of a person's status as a "faculty member" or a "student" in a particular situation shall be determined by the surrounding facts.
The following enumeration of rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by faculty members as members of the University community or as citizens of the community at large. Subject to and to the extent permitted by law and Board of Regents policy, faculty shall have the following rights:
Faculty members shall have the legal rights and privileges of citizens. Faculty members have the right to academic freedom and the right to freedom of inquiry, expression, and assembly.
Faculty members shall have the right to impartial application of unit/department, school, and University policies.
Faculty members shall have the right to participate in the determination of school, department, and University policies and procedures consistent with the principles of shared governance. Faculty members have the right to impartial treatment in the application of school, department, and university policies and decisions.
Faculty members have the right to participate in the determination of their teaching, administrative, and other university assignments and responsibilities, subject to Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSRR) 5.7.1 and 5.7.2 and applicable school and unit policies. This right recognizes that the proportions of time and energy devoted to teaching, advising, research, service, administration, and other responsibilities may vary from individual to individual, and for the same individual over time. Faculty members have the right to impartial treatment in the application of university policies and procedures for the evaluation of their performance of these responsibilities, including the right to participate in that evaluation.
Faculty members have a right to be informed about personnel files that contain information about them. Faculty personnel files are maintained by the Provostï¿½s Office, Human Resources, the college/school or comparable unit, and the department(s) or comparable units(s) in which the faculty member is appointed. Subject to the provisions of Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSRR) 7.2, the faculty member shall have the right to examine the contents of such files and notify the Provost of any inaccuracies or missing information in the files.
Faculty members have a right to be secure in their persons, offices, papers, computers, electronic files and effects against unlawful searches and seizures.
Faculty members have a right to due process in all disciplinary matters. Faculty members have the right to peer judgment through the hearing process. The sanctions listed in Article VI of this Code may not be imposed upon a faculty member without notice of the charges against him or her and the opportunity to request a hearing before the Judicial Board or the Faculty Rights Board. The Judicial Board shall have jurisdiction if the recommended sanction is a ï¿½warningï¿½ or ï¿½restitution.ï¿½ The Faculty Rights Board shall have jurisdiction in all other cases. If the faculty member requests a hearing, the University will stay imposition of the sanction pending disposition of the request. The opportunity for a faculty member to request a hearing before the Judicial Board or the Faculty Rights Board is subject to University Senate Code, University Senate Rules & Regulations, and Faculty Senate Rules & Regulations as applicable. The Office of University Governance can provide further information.
Faculty members, groups, and organizations may invite and hear any persons of their own choosing, subject only to the requirements for use of University facilities, the University policies on fundraising, political activity, and solicitation, the Board of Regents policies on political activity and solicitation, and other relevant policies.
University facilities shall be made available for assignment to faculty members, individually or in groups, even though not formally organized, subject to University and Board of Regents policies on facilities use. Preference may be given to programs designed for audiences consisting of members of the University community.
Faculty members, groups, or organizations may distribute written or electronic material on campus without prior approval so long as the distribution is consistent with University and Board of Regents policy and state and federal law. The person or persons responsible for such material must be clearly indicated.
Faculty members have the right to pursue opportunities for improving their skills and developing their talents related to their responsibilities as teachers and scholars contingent upon the availability of resources and compliance with applicable University and Board of Regents policies (e.g., travel, conflict of interest, leaves, class schedules, etc.).
Faculty members have the right to engage in a limited amount of outside work, for pay or without pay, in accordance with state ethics laws and Board of Regents and University policy on commitment of time, conflict of interest, consulting, and other employment.
Faculty members have the right to be evaluated annually according to University policy. Each faculty member shall receive from the departmental chairperson or dean a written statement evaluating his/her performance during the preceding year. Typically, the faculty member will be evaluated on teaching, scholarship, service, and/or professional performance consistent with University and unit expectations as set forth in Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSRR) Articles VI and VII, the position, and approved allocation of effort.
Tenured faculty may be removed only for cause, in cases of program discontinuation, or in cases of bona fide financial exigency consistent with Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSRR) 6.1.2. The University will follow the University Senate Code, Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations, and University Senate Rules and Regulations as applicable in such cases.
The responsibilities of the faculty as a whole are multiple and are not to be construed as limited to any specific list. The same is true of the responsibilities of individual faculty members. Nonetheless, the major responsibilities are traditionally divided into teaching, scholarship, service, and/or professional performance consistent with University and unit expectations as set forth in Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSRR) Articles VI and VII, the position, and approved allocation of effort. ï¿½These are the criteria used in awarding promotion and tenure, and they are also the criteria used in faculty evaluations. Each faculty member is expected to meet academic responsibilities at an acceptable level in all areas over time, including the additional faculty responsibilities outlined in Section 5 of this article.
Faculty who teach are expected to teach courses in their department / school in accordance with the needs, requirements and expectations of the unit and the general requirements concerning the conduct of classes specified in various University regulations.
Good teaching requires continual application and effort. Faculty who teach are expected to keep abreast of new developments in their fields and must maintain credentials as scholars so that they are part of the creative process by which the frontiers of knowledge and culture are continually being expanded. A teacher should be engaged with his/her particular discipline and should be able to convey to the students the value of the subject.
Teaching duties of a professor include planning classroom and/or online activities as appropriate to the method of course delivery; preparing course syllabi; designing assignments and/or examinations; holding regular office hours or being available for consultation; supervising independent work undertaken by students; directing theses and dissertations; evaluating students: assessing and documenting student learning; advising; and developing and assessing curricula.
A professor is expected to treat students with professional courtesy and to respect their rights, including, but not limited to, academic freedom and those rights as outlined in the Student Code of Rights and Responsibilities.
Teaching responsibilities include prompt and regular presence during scheduled class hours whether in a physical classroom or online, as appropriate to the mode of course delivery. In the case of forms of online course delivery that do not involve regular meeting times for the entire class, teaching responsibilities include meeting unit expectations for other forms of student ï¿½ teacher and student ï¿½ student interaction. With the exception of illness or emergency, a faculty member must make satisfactory advance arrangements and obtain his/her chairï¿½s or deanï¿½s approval if he/she will be absent from class or unable to meet his/her online teaching responsibilities, or if he/she needs to change a class time or location. Such approval will be granted only if it is determined that these arrangements are made for sound academic reasons and do not cause undue hardship for any student and will be timely communicated to the students by the faculty member.
Faculty members have the responsibility to engage continuously in scholarship consistent with University and unit expectations as set forth in Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSRR) Articles VI and VII, the position, and approved allocation of effort. Scholarship encompasses not only traditional academic research and publication but also the creation of artistic works or performances and any other products or activities accepted by the academic or professional discipline as reflecting scholarly effort and achievement. Scholarship should be subject to the critical scrutiny of peers and should expand the frontiers of knowledge and culture.
Faculty members have a responsibility to demonstrate ethical and responsible behavior in the design, conduct, and reporting of academic scholarship consistent with the standards of their disciplines. Faculty have a responsibility to act as positive examples of responsible scholarship for students and developing scholars.
Service to the Academic Department or Research Unit. It is essential that all members of the unit share in the work necessary for the effective functioning of the unit. Thus, each faculty member has the responsibility to participate regularly and fully in that unit.
Service to the School and the University. Faculty members are expected to serve on school and University committees.
Service to the Profession. Faculty members are expected to be active in their professional fields. This includes belonging to and taking part in the professional activities of their field on the local, regional, national or international levels, as appropriate to the discipline.
Service to the community, state, nation, world. The use of academic expertise to help community, state, nation and world is appropriate service, although the extent to which one contributes outside the University depends on oneï¿½s field, inclination, opportunity, and other relevant factors.
For library faculty and some unclassified academic staff with faculty equivalent rank, responsibilities include the performance of professional activities consistent with stated University and unit expectations for the position as set forth in Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSRR) Articles VI and VII. Faculty members are expected to perform professional responsibilities satisfactorily, with due diligence, and in conformance with professional standards.
Be aware of federal and state law, Board of Regents, and University policies and regulations and comply with them.
Respect the confidential relationship between the University and its students by preserving the privacy of all records relating to students and protecting student information from improper disclosure.
Receive prior approval from the Office of the Chancellor when distributing written or electronic materials for solicitation purposes. Refrain from the use of campus mail and campus electronic communications devices for political purposes.
Refrain from knowingly furnishing false information to the University, or forging, altering, or misusing University documents or instruments of identification.
Refrain from engaging in behavior in the discharge of duties that violates commonly accepted standards of professional ethics as defined, for example, in the statement of professional ethics adopted by the 52nd Annual Meeting of the AAUP, April, 19661. Abusive or unprofessional treatment of students, faculty, or other members of the University falls within this category, e.g., see the University policy on consenting relationships. Also proscribed is any form of discrimination, including sexual harassment, as outlined in federal and state law and University policy.
Refrain from committing an act that involves such moral turpitude as to render the faculty member unfit for his/her position. As used in this section, conduct involving moral turpitude means intentional conduct, prohibited by law, which is injurious to another person or to society and which constitutes a substantial deviation from the accepted standards of duty owed by a person to other persons and society.
A leave without pay for up to three years may be granted by the chief executive officer of the employing institution when such is judged by the chief executive officer to be in the best interest of the institution. No leave may be granted to any employee who has accepted a permanent position with another postsecondary education institution.
Any extension of a leave without pay beyond three years requires the approval of the Board. The chief executive officer of the employing institution shall provide documentation of extraordinary circumstances justifying the extension of such leave beyond three years.
Leaves without pay shall not be regarded as a break in service; however, such leave shall not count toward the earning of sabbatical leave nor shall other than a scholarly leave count toward the tenure probationary period. Scholarly leave shall count toward the tenure probationary period unless the employee and the institution agree in writing to the contrary at the time the leave is granted.
During a leave of absence without pay, an employee's eligibility for health insurance shall be determined by and be in accord with the policies, rules and regulations of the State Employees Health Insurance Commission.
Sanctions constitute disciplinary action. Sanctions therefore do not include written or verbal feedback from an administrator concerning oneï¿½s performance or behavior such as those resulting from annual or other University performance evaluations. Faculty who fail to fulfill the responsibilities specified in Article IV of this Code may be subject to sanction. As stated in Article III.7 of this code, sanctions may not be imposed upon a faculty member without notice of the charges against him or her and the opportunity for a hearing or appeal before the Judicial Board or the Faculty Rights Board. The Judicial Board shall have jurisdiction if the recommended sanction is a ï¿½warningï¿½ or ï¿½restitution.ï¿½ The Faculty Rights Board shall have jurisdiction in all other cases. If the faculty member requests a hearing, the University will stay imposition of the sanction pending disposition of the request. Sanctions of censure, suspension, or dismissal shall be applied only after the faculty member has the opportunity for a hearing before the Faculty Rights Board.
Sanctions shall be commensurate with the severity of the offense. Accordingly, determination of appropriate sanctions should take into account whether a faculty member intentionally and willfully failed to meet a responsibility or whether a faculty member made a good faith attempt to meet a responsibility. Repeated infractions of oneï¿½s responsibilities are more serious than initial infractions of the same type.
One or more of the following sanctions may be imposed. Sanctions, listed below in order of severity, need not be applied serially, and a more serious sanction may be applied without a less serious one having been previously applied.
Warning. Notice in writing that continuation or repetition of conduct found wrongful, within a period of time stated in the warning, may be cause for more severe disciplinary action.
Restitution. Reimbursement for damage to or misappropriation of property. This may take the form of appropriate service or other compensation.
Recommendation of Censure. Recommendation to the Chancellor that a faculty member be formally reprimanded.
Recommendation of Suspension. Recommendation to the Chancellor that a faculty member be excluded from teaching and other specified privileges or activities without pay for a definite period not in excess of two years.
Recommendation of Dismissal. Recommendation to the Chancellor that a faculty member be dismissed from the University.
1The 73rd Annual Meeting of the AAUP (1987) endorsed the following "Statement on Professional Ethics" and it was revised in 2009. It is a revision of a statement originally adopted in 1966. Many other professional organizations also have adopted codes by which unethical conduct can be judged.
Professors, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed upon them. Their primary responsibility to their subject is to seek and to state the truth as they see it. To this end professors devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence. They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending, and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their freedom of inquiry.
As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors demonstrate respect for students as individuals, and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to ensure that their evaluations of students reflect each student's true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from them. They protect their academic freedom.
As colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. Professors do not discriminate against or harass colleagues. They respect and defend the free inquiry of associates, even when it leads to findings and conclusions that differ from their own. Professors acknowledge academic debt and strive to be objective in their professional judgment of colleagues. Professors accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution.
As members of an academic institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars. Although professors observe the stated regulations of the institution, provided the regulations do not contravene academic freedom, they maintain their right to criticize and seek revision. Professors give due regard to their paramount responsibilities within their institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, professors recognize the effect of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.
As members of their community, professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens. Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution. When they speak or act as private persons they avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their college or university. As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, professors have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom.

PolicyPurpose:ï¿½Staff may be disciplined for reasons of inadequate performance, misconduct, violation of established policies and procedures, or other cause. This policy outlines the disciplinary actions which may be taken for staff.
Campus:ï¿½EdwardsLawrenceJuniper GardensParsonsYoderTopekaPolicy Statement:ï¿½It is the responsibility of every employee to practice self-discipline, to adhere to the expectations and instructions outlined by the employeeï¿½s supervisor and as provided in a position description and to perform duties in a manner consistent with the applicable laws, regulations, policies, minutes and resolutions of the State of Kansas, the Kansas Board of Regents, and the University of Kansas.
When supervisors are considering disciplinary action, they should do so in consultation with their administrative channels and with Human Resource Management (HRM) before initiating disciplinary action.
Disciplinary action for misconduct or inadequate performance may include a written reprimand, suspension without pay, involuntary demotion, or dismissal. Work history, legitimate mitigating circumstances, and the nature and/or pattern of the misconduct or performance inadequacy may be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate disciplinary action.
The appropriate administrator, in consultation with HRM, may review a written reprimand and will review a recommendation for suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal from unit heads. If it is agreed that disciplinary action is warranted, the written reprimand will be issued, and the administrator or delegate for Unclassified Professional Staff (UPS) or HRM for University Support Staff (USS) will issue the written notice of proposed suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal.
Only administrators (or their designees) as specified in the Chancellor's Delegation letterï¿½are authorized to issue written reprimands and disciplinary action letters for suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal to Unclassified Professional Staff (UPS). Written reprimands should be issued through the Universityï¿½s performance management system and are usually issued by supervisors or department heads.
Administrators may designate HRM to issue the disciplinary action notices for suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal to unclassified professional staff. HRM will issue those notices to university support staff.
The disciplinary action letter will provide the staff member with an opportunity to respond to the proposed suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal by a deadline specified in the letter before the final decision is made. A staff member may have duties reassigned or may be administratively relieved from duties with or without pay, depending on the circumstances, pending the outcome of these disciplinary actions. Duty reassignment and administrative relief from duty are not disciplinary actions.
Staff may appeal a written reprimand to HRM within 5 working days of its issuance as measured by the appealing employeeï¿½s work schedule.
University Support Staff (USS), not otherwise precluded, who are not within their probationary period may appeal a suspension, involuntary demotion or dismissal to the Disciplinary Action Hearing Board which serves in an advisory capacity to the Provost for a final agency action. http://policy.ku.edu/provost/disciplinary-action-hearing-board-support-s...
An Unclassified Professional Staff (UPS) member may, by the deadline specified in the notice letter, discuss the suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal with the administrator taking the disciplinary action. If the unclassified professional staff reports directly to the administrator taking these disciplinary action and has discussed the action with that individual, the employee may appeal that decision to an administrator designated by the Provost or Chancellor for that purpose.
An appeal of disciplinary action will not stop the action nor change the effective date of the action. Any adjustments will occur after the effective date of the action. The final disciplinary decision made by the administrator or HRM represents the Universityï¿½s final agency action and is not subject to further review or subject to a grievance within the University.
Staff whose employment is ending will be notified when the termination is finalized and if they are ineligible for rehire by the University for one or more years as determined by HRM.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances:ï¿½Staff who are appointed to temporary positions and staff who are within their probationary period are ï¿½at willï¿½ employees and are therefore exempt from the provisions of this policy. Their appointments may end as specified or at any time earlier without recourse.
Non-reappointments of unclassified professional staff are not disciplinary actions. This policy does not apply to non-reappointments, or to terminations of ï¿½serve at the pleasure ofï¿½ appointments.
This policy does not apply to staff covered by a Memorandum of Agreement whose provisions specify a disciplinary action process.

The University of Kansas prohibits the unlawful possession, use, manufacture, purchase, or distribution of alcohol or drugs, or any attempt thereof, by students or by employees on its property or as part of its activities.
The University is committed to a program to prevent the illegal or irresponsible use of drugs and alcohol by students and employees. Any student or employee found to be using, possessing, manufacturing, or distributing controlled substances or alcohol, or whose behavior evidences being under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, in violation of the law on University property or at University events shall be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with policies of the State of Kansas, the Board of Regents, and the University of Kansas.
For employees, the University will take appropriate personnel action for such infractions, up to and including termination. See the Policy and Procedures on Substance Abuse. Students who violate this policy will be subject to sanctions which may include completion of an approved drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, disciplinary warning, probation, suspension and expulsion from the University.
As a condition of employment, all employees of the University of Kansas shall abide by the terms of this policy statement and will notify the University of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such conviction. The University will, in turn, notify as appropriate, the applicable federal agency of the conviction within ten days of receipt of notification of conviction.

PolicyPurpose:ï¿½To address situations in which two persons have an apparently voluntary romantic or sexual relationship, but where a power differential exists because of their roles within the university, e.g., faculty/student or supervisor/employee.
The University of Kansas has a tradition of commitment to providing an academic community environment that, without discrimination, fosters intellectual, professional and personal growth. Central to the preservation of this environment is the trust that should characterize all interactions among those working toward the common goal of the institution, namely, our students, faculty, unclassified staff, and university support staff. This trust is put at risk when members of the University community engage in consenting romantic or sexual relationships that involve persons of unequal power, for example, administrator and faculty, faculty and student, supervisor and employee. Because the University of Kansas strongly disapproves of consenting relationships where a professional power differential exists, this policy statement is being promulgated.
A faculty member will always be treated as having such a power differential if the student is in an educational experience where the faculty member has authority to assign grades. The same holds in other circumstances as well, for example, when a faculty member serves on thesis, dissertation, or scholarship awards committees.
These principles also apply to administrators and supervisors in their relationships with students, faculty, unclassified staff, and university support staff.
In the view of the University of Kansas, romantic or sexual relationships between persons of unequal power, even if consenting, are unwise and often contrary to professional ethics. Such a relationship tends to impair one's ability to make an objective judgment of the performance of the student or employee.
Those who choose to ignore these standards will stand responsible for their actions and risk the loss of support of the University community.
Decisions concerning grades, degrees, promotions, evaluations, merit increases, and awards must be made free from any trace of bias or favor. Such decisions come under a cloud when made by those who have an emotional relationship, beyond the purely professional or academic one, with those who benefit from those decisions.
The individual in authority bears the primary responsibility for any negative consequences resulting from an even apparently consenting romantic or sexual relationship. It is the student or the employee, not the instructor or supervisor, who is most at risk in these relationships. In particular, the respect and trust accorded a professor by a student, as well as the legitimate power exercised by the professor in giving grades, criticism, praise, recommendations for further study, future employment, etc., greatly diminish the student's actual freedom of choice, should sexual favors be added to the professor's demands. Although it is proper for a student to decline any personal relationship of this kind, a student may feel that few options are available when a professor asks for a date.
If an employee's supervisor attempts to initiate a personal relationship, the employee may feel that the employee's options are similarly limited. As a result, the degree of informed consent that exists within such a relationship is difficult to establish. Should a charge of sexual harassment follow, a claim of mutual consent may be difficult to sustain.
Commonly accepted standards of professional behavior and ethics require that faculty members not hold evaluative power over any student with whom they have a romantic or sexual relationship. Thus, faculty members should not initiate or accept such a relationship with a student over whom they have an evaluative role. Should such a relationship exist between a faculty member and a student, the faculty member shall not evaluate the student's work. Failure to do so will be a violation of Article IV, Section 5.g. of the Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct.
Similar proscription applies to administrators and supervisors in their relationships with students and employees over whom they have an evaluative role. A supervisor who is in a romantic or sexual relationship with another individual where an evaluative responsibility must be removed from personnel decisions concerning that individual, such as appointment, retention, promotion, discipline, tenure, or salary. Failure to do so will be a conflict of interest.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances:ï¿½University Business Travel: University employees may not share a hotel room (i.e., a room behind a locking door) or equivalent overnight accommodations with any KU student, regardless of whether the student is also a university employee, unless the employee and student have a legally recognized family relationship. Subject to this and all other university policies, the following special circumstances apply:
University employees may share multi-room accommodations (e.g., rental house) with KU student(s) if the student(s) are provided with a room behind a locking door separate from any university employee; or
If the nature of the travel makes separate accommodations structurally impossible (e.g., tents for field work), provided that in all such circumstances (1) every effort is made to maximize privacy, and (2) the student(s) are made aware as early in advance as possible of the accommodations and informed that they are not obligated to travel.
Consequences:ï¿½If a romantic or sexual relationship exists between a faculty member and a student over whom the faculty member has an evaluative role, the faculty member shall not evaluate the student's work. This obligation continues even after the relationship has ended. Failure to do so will be a violation of Article IV, Section 5.g of the Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct and the faculty member may be subject to one of the sanctions listed in Article VI of the Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (warning, restitution, recommendation of censure, recommendation of suspension, recommendation of dismissal).
Similar proscription applies to administrators and supervisors in their relationships with students and employees over whom they have an evaluative role. A supervisor who is in a romantic or sexual relationship with another individual over where an evaluative responsibility exists must be removed from personnel decisions concerning that individual, such as appointment, retention, promotion, discipline, tenure, or salary. Failure to do so will be a conflict of interest and will be subject to disciplinary action for violation of University policy, up to and including dismissal.

PolicyPurpose:ï¿½To describe the process for resolution of complaints of discrimination on the basis of race (including racial harassment), religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual harassment, and sexual violence), disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity and gender expression.
Policy Statement:ï¿½In accordance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11246, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Jobs for Veterans Act of 2002, the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination and all other applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination statutes, the University of Kansas prohibits discrimination.
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, and genetic information in the university's programs and activities.ï¿½ Retaliation is also prohibited by university policy. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policies and are the Title IX coordinators for their respective campuses: Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, 913-588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas medical center campuses).
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, is committed to the full participation of previously excluded or neglected classes of people. Thus, it is also the policy of the university to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, and gender expression.
The university's nondiscrimination policy extends to employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions and all other educational programs and activities of the university and its affiliates. It also extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and an individual's associates that may arise as a result of a discrimination complaint. Leaders in the university community continuously examine all areas of the institution, make policy decisions, and implement strategies to eliminate and prevent discrimination wherever necessary.
The University of Kansas is committed to resolving discrimination complaints in a timely and effective manner and providing prompt corrective action if discrimination is believed to have occurred. The discrimination complaint resolution process is intended to provide effective resolution for complaints of discrimination on the basis of race (including racial harassment), religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual harassment, and sexual violence), disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran , sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity and gender expression. Affected persons, including students, faculty, staff, community members or others involved in university events or programs, may utilize the process to address complaints of discrimination related to University hiring and selection procedures, employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions, or University educational programs and activities.
Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a prohibited discriminatory practice at the University may contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.ï¿½Individuals who may use this procedure include, but are not limited to: individuals applying for enrollment or employment with the university; students; faculty, including those with visiting appointments; teaching or research assistants; postdoctoral research associates and fellows; university support staff and other unclassified employees; university administrators; and other persons receiving university services or participating in university programs. A person in the university community may ask that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX initiate an investigation of a specific matter. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when it has reason to believe that discriminatory or retaliatory action is occurring.
The process for resolving discrimination complaints may include some or all of the following actions: informal inquiry and discussion, mediation (except in cases of sexual harassment), disciplinary action, or other appropriate action. If the subject matter or issue of the complaint does not fall within the jurisdiction of this policy, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will advise the complainant of other available procedures.
In many cases, individuals will take appropriate corrective action when they are made aware of how their actions or behaviors are being perceived. If the complainant is comfortable doing so, the complainant may bring the concerns to the attention of the person responsible for the behavior or action. Complainants who choose not to address the discrimination directly on their own or through other informal processes may seek the assistance of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.ï¿½Complainants are encouraged to file their complaints within one hundred eighty (180) days of the most recent occurrence of the alleged discrimination.
Unit heads and others who serve in leadership roles in the university are responsible for nondiscrimination in their employment and academic environments. With the exceptions specified below, all employees at the University of Kansas are required to contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX at 785-864-6414 or civilrights@ku.edu to report incidents of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, of which they know or have reason to believe may have occurred.
For example, if a student shares information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, with a faculty or staff member, the faculty or staff member must report the information to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when appropriate and in the interests of the University to do so.
Health care providers and pastoral and professional counselors who receive information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, while acting in their role as a health care provider or pastoral or professional counselor are not required to report such information to Office of Civil Rights & Title IX; and
The CARE Coordinator, who is the employee designated to provide information about reporting options on a confidential basis.
The University Ombuds and Faculty Ombuds, who are employees designated to provide confidential assistance to persons seeking information about University policies and processes.
Employees who are exempt from reporting to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX still have an obligation to exercise reasonable care to protect a foreseeable victim from danger and to make reports mandated by law.ï¿½ In addition, exempt employees shall encourage individuals to report discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, to contact Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and the police.
Any individual who believes that they have been the subject of discrimination or retaliation, or a Dean, Director, Chairperson or other supervisor or administrator who has reason to believe that discrimination or retaliation may have occurred, should contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to initiate the filing of a complaint. A complaint should include the following, to the extent known and available:
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide the complainant with an acknowledgement of receipt within seven (7) working days and will include in that acknowledgement the web address where the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process can be found.
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall conduct an initial evaluation of the merits of the complaint and determine the appropriate investigatory action required. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will contact the dean, director, administrator, supervisor, or chairperson responsible for the unit to inform them of the filing of the complaint. When necessary, appropriate administrator(s) or faculty member(s) may be designated by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Vice Provost, Dean, Director, or Chairperson, by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or by the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to participate in the evaluation of the complaint and to facilitate necessary action.
A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy and articulates sufficient facts, which if determined to be accurate, would support a finding that the University's discrimination policies have been violated. Investigators assigned to conduct an investigation will be impartial. In conducting investigations into violations of the Universityï¿½s Policies, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will use a preponderance of the evidence standard in making factual determinations. A preponderance of the evidence standard means the fact in issue is more probably true than not.
The University will strive to complete discrimination complaint investigations, including issuance of a report of findings to the complainant and respondent, in as timely and efficient a manner as possible within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complaint. However, this timeframe may be extended based on factors such as, but not limited to, schedule and availability of witnesses, holidays or semester breaks including summer break, and complexity of the complaint. If an investigation cannot be completed within sixty (60) days of receipt of the complaint, then the investigator(s) will notify the complainant and respondent of that fact and provide a timeframe for completing the investigation.
Notice to Respondent. The respondent will be provided with a statement of the complaint in writing, and the complainant will be provided a copy of this notification. The respondent will be provided an opportunity to meet with the investigator(s) investigating the complaint and to respond to the allegation. Respondents may respond in person or in writing within a reasonable time to be determined by the investigators. If a respondent chooses not to participate or refuses to answer a complaint, the nonparticipation will not prevent the investigation from proceeding and could result in a finding based solely on the information provided by the complainant.
Notice regarding Retaliation. All parties to a complaint (complainant, respondent, witnesses, and appropriate administrators or supervisors) will be informed that retaliation by an individual or an individual's associates against any person who files a complaint or any person who participates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation are subject to disciplinary action.
Contact with Complainant. If the investigator did not speak with the complainant at the time that the complaint was received by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, then the investigator will meet or speak with the complainant at the start of the investigation and throughout the investigation as appropriate.
Representation. In any meeting with the investigators, the parties to the complaint (complainant and the respondent) may bring a representative to the meeting. If the representative is an attorney, the party must notify the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing at least three (3) working days before the meeting date.
Information relevant to Investigation. The parties to a complaint (complainant and respondent) will be informed that they have the opportunity to identify witnesses, present witness statements, and any other evidence they believe relevant to resolution of the complaint. The investigator(s) will interview other persons whom, at the investigator(s)' discretion determines to be necessary to gather relevant information. The investigator will review any written materials, e-mails or other media that, at the investigator's discretion may provide relevant information regarding the complaint.
Findings of Investigation. The investigator(s) will provide a written summary of their findings to the respondent and the complainant within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the investigation. In addition, the investigator(s) will provide a written report of the investigation findings and recommendations to the appropriate administrators within the University who will determine the appropriate action to be taken in light of the investigation findings and recommendations. The administrators will have twenty working days from receipt of the investigation findings and recommendations to determine, in consultation with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, an appropriate resolution(s). Upon making their decision, the administrator(s) will provide written notification of their decision to both the respondent and complainant.
Respondent, Finding of Discrimination or Retaliation with Imposition of Discipline. If formal disciplinary action is imposed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation, then a respondent may seek as follows:
Faculty member or an unclassified academic staff member. The affected employee may request a hearing before the University Judicial Board or the Faculty Rights Board, as determined by the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.2 and the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff.)
Student. The student may request a hearing in accordance with the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities. If the student does not request a hearing, the Vice Provost for Student Affairs will determine the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.9).
Graduate Teaching Assistant. A graduate teaching assistant may request a review in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the University of Kansas, the Kansas Board of Regents and the Kansas Association of Public Employees (representing graduate teaching assistants at the University of Kansas, Lawrence). (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.16).
Other Student Employees, including Graduate Research Assistants and Graduate Assistants. Other student employees, including graduate research assistants and graduate assistants, may request that a supervisor's decision be reviewed by the next-level administrator and/or may contact Human Resource Management for assistance at hrdept@ku.edu or 785-864-4946.
Unclassified Professional Staff Employee. An unclassified professional staff member may seek review of disciplinary actions as specified by University policy,ï¿½http://policy.ku.edu/hr/Disciplinary_Action_Policy_for_Staff.
University Support Staff Employee. A University Support Staff employee who is not serving an initial probationary period and has been suspended, demoted, or dismissed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation may appeal the sanction to the University Disciplinary Action Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in University policy, http://policy.ku.edu/provost/disciplinary-action-hearing-board-support-staff.
The University may not proceed with a complaint investigation under a variety of circumstances, for instance:
A complainant, even after contact and follow up with an investigator, fails to describe in sufficient detail the conduct that is the basis of the complaint;
If it is determined that the University will not proceed with investigation of a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will notify the complainant (if not anonymous) in writing explaining the reasons why the complaint is not being investigated. The notification letter will include a statement notifying the complainant that the complainant may appeal the determination not to proceed with an investigation of the complaint to the Vice Chancellor and Provost with ten (10) working days of the notice. The request for an appeal must be a signed, written document articulating why the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation was in error. The Vice Chancellor and Provost will respond to the request for appeal within twenty (20) working days of receipt of the appeal. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is upheld, then that decision will constitute final agency action and there is no further appeal within the University. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is overturned, the complaint will be sent back to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX for investigation in accordance with this procedure.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will make every reasonable attempt to adhere to the time limits set forth in these procedures. However, it is recognized that circumstances may necessitate an extension of time. Therefore, the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may extend the time limits set forth in these procedures.
Retaliation against persons who file discrimination complaints or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint, whether by an individual directly involved or by associates of the individual involved, is a violation of law and University policy. Complainants who utilize these procedures or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint should not be subjected to retaliation. Retaliation may take the form of unwanted personal contact from the respondent or giving additional assignments that are not assigned to others in similar situations, poor grades or unreasonable course assignments. Phone calls, e-mail or other attempts to discuss the complaint may be perceived as retaliation under certain circumstances. Disciplinary action, harassment, unsupported evaluations, or other adverse changes in the conditions of employment or the educational environment may also constitute retaliation. Retaliation will not be tolerated and could result in suspension, reassignment, salary reduction, termination, expulsion or other disciplinary action.
The University takes all discrimination complaints seriously. However, knowingly filing a false complaint is considered serious misconduct and is also subject to sanction. An individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints that harass colleagues and/or abuse the complaint resolution process may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time. Such cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of University Senate Rules and Regulations section 6.5.4, Abuse of Grievance Process.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will handle all discrimination and harassment complaints discreetly but cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity because the University has an obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment and to maintain a safe environment, free from harassment and discrimination. Because of its obligations under the law, KU will not be able to honor all requests for confidentiality or all requests that a complaint not be pursued.
However, complainants, respondents, witnesses, and any other parties involved in a complaint of discrimination shall refrain from disclosing information about a complaint of discrimination to anyone who does not have a legitimate, business need or right to know. Such disclosures are inappropriate and unprofessional and may result in disciplinary action. The foregoing does not preclude either party from seeking the advice or counsel of a supervisor, counselor, attorney, or other person in a similar role.
Employees may file employment discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. Students may file discrimination complaints through the Office of Civil Rights in the U. S. Department of Education or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX can provide information about deadlines and filing procedures for the state and federal agencies.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances:ï¿½In accordance with the Abuse of the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process section above and the provisions of the University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.5.4, an individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time.
Consequences:ï¿½Members of the University community who are found to have violated the University Nondiscrimination Policy are subject to disciplinary actions appropriate to their status as faculty, staff, or student employees or as students.

PolicyPurpose:ï¿½Staff may be disciplined for reasons of inadequate performance, misconduct, violation of established policies and procedures, or other cause. This policy outlines the disciplinary actions which may be taken for staff.
Campus:ï¿½EdwardsLawrenceJuniper GardensParsonsYoderTopekaPolicy Statement:ï¿½It is the responsibility of every employee to practice self-discipline, to adhere to the expectations and instructions outlined by the employeeï¿½s supervisor and as provided in a position description and to perform duties in a manner consistent with the applicable laws, regulations, policies, minutes and resolutions of the State of Kansas, the Kansas Board of Regents, and the University of Kansas.
When supervisors are considering disciplinary action, they should do so in consultation with their administrative channels and with Human Resource Management (HRM) before initiating disciplinary action.
Disciplinary action for misconduct or inadequate performance may include a written reprimand, suspension without pay, involuntary demotion, or dismissal. Work history, legitimate mitigating circumstances, and the nature and/or pattern of the misconduct or performance inadequacy may be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate disciplinary action.
The appropriate administrator, in consultation with HRM, may review a written reprimand and will review a recommendation for suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal from unit heads. If it is agreed that disciplinary action is warranted, the written reprimand will be issued, and the administrator or delegate for Unclassified Professional Staff (UPS) or HRM for University Support Staff (USS) will issue the written notice of proposed suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal.
Only administrators (or their designees) as specified in the Chancellor's Delegation letterï¿½are authorized to issue written reprimands and disciplinary action letters for suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal to Unclassified Professional Staff (UPS). Written reprimands should be issued through the Universityï¿½s performance management system and are usually issued by supervisors or department heads.
Administrators may designate HRM to issue the disciplinary action notices for suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal to unclassified professional staff. HRM will issue those notices to university support staff.
The disciplinary action letter will provide the staff member with an opportunity to respond to the proposed suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal by a deadline specified in the letter before the final decision is made. A staff member may have duties reassigned or may be administratively relieved from duties with or without pay, depending on the circumstances, pending the outcome of these disciplinary actions. Duty reassignment and administrative relief from duty are not disciplinary actions.
Staff may appeal a written reprimand to HRM within 5 working days of its issuance as measured by the appealing employeeï¿½s work schedule.
University Support Staff (USS), not otherwise precluded, who are not within their probationary period may appeal a suspension, involuntary demotion or dismissal to the Disciplinary Action Hearing Board which serves in an advisory capacity to the Provost for a final agency action. http://policy.ku.edu/provost/disciplinary-action-hearing-board-support-s...
An Unclassified Professional Staff (UPS) member may, by the deadline specified in the notice letter, discuss the suspension, involuntary demotion, or dismissal with the administrator taking the disciplinary action. If the unclassified professional staff reports directly to the administrator taking these disciplinary action and has discussed the action with that individual, the employee may appeal that decision to an administrator designated by the Provost or Chancellor for that purpose.
An appeal of disciplinary action will not stop the action nor change the effective date of the action. Any adjustments will occur after the effective date of the action. The final disciplinary decision made by the administrator or HRM represents the Universityï¿½s final agency action and is not subject to further review or subject to a grievance within the University.
Staff whose employment is ending will be notified when the termination is finalized and if they are ineligible for rehire by the University for one or more years as determined by HRM.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances:ï¿½Staff who are appointed to temporary positions and staff who are within their probationary period are ï¿½at willï¿½ employees and are therefore exempt from the provisions of this policy. Their appointments may end as specified or at any time earlier without recourse.
Non-reappointments of unclassified professional staff are not disciplinary actions. This policy does not apply to non-reappointments, or to terminations of ï¿½serve at the pleasure ofï¿½ appointments.
This policy does not apply to staff covered by a Memorandum of Agreement whose provisions specify a disciplinary action process.

Inadequate Performance ï¿½ The performance of oneï¿½s job duties which does not meet an acceptable level of standards and/or expectations of a supervisor and/or manager.

ProcedurePurpose:ï¿½To articulate the Universityï¿½s procedures for resolving complaints of sexual harassment.
These hearing procedures apply to the resolution of Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment under the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy after such Formal Complaints have been investigated by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX pursuant to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX' Title IX Resolution Process.
A. Administrative Officeï¿½refers to the office within the University responsible for administering these procedures. The Administrative Office varies depending on the status of the Respondent (i.e., administrator; faculty; student; or staff/third party) as specified herein.
B. Administrative Officerï¿½refers to an individual designated by the Administrative Office to coordinate the logistics of these procedures in collaboration with the Hearing Chair.
C. Advisorï¿½refers to an individual of a partyï¿½s choosing who provides emotional support to a party; assists the party in preparing for the hearing; attends pre-hearing meetings with the party; and who conducts questioning on behalf of a party at the hearing. An advisor may, but does not have to be, an attorney. The role of the Advisor is further explained herein.
D. Complainantï¿½refers to the individual who is alleged to be the victim of the alleged Sexual Harassment stated in the Formal Complaint.
E. Formal Complaintï¿½refers to a Formal Complaint as defined in the Office of Civil Rights & Title IXï¿½s Title IX Resolution Process.
F. Hearing Chairï¿½refers to a single individual who oversees and administers the prehearing procedures, hearing, deliberation, and determination. The Hearing Chair, together with the Hearing Panel, resolves disputed facts under a preponderance of the evidence standard and determines whether those facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint.
G. Hearing Panel refers to two individuals who, together with the Hearing Chair, receive evidence at the hearing, resolve disputed facts under a preponderance of the evidence standard, and determine whether those facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint.
H. Relevant Evidenceï¿½is that evidence which has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and where the fact is of consequence in determining the allegations of Sexual Harassment at issue in a Formal Complaint. Some evidence, such as certain evidence of a Complainantï¿½s sexual history, is categorically excluded as irrelevant, as further specified herein.
I. Respondentï¿½refers to the individual who is alleged to have perpetrated the alleged Sexual Harassment stated in the Formal Complaint.
J.ï¿½Sexual Harassmentï¿½refers to Sexual Harassment as defined in the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy, including Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking as those terms are defined in the Universityï¿½s Sexual Harassment Policy.
At the conclusion of its Title IX Resolution Process, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will transmit a copy of its final investigation report, together with all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint, to the Administrative Office. The Administrative Office responsible for administering these procedures varies based on the status of the Respondent. The relevant offices are:
Upon receipt of the investigation report and evidence, the Administrative Office will appoint an Administrative Officer who shall thereafter be responsible for coordinating the selection of a Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, assisting the Hearing Chair in arranging the pre-hearing conference and hearing, and ensuring an appropriate record of the proceedings is made.
The University will maintain a pool of up to six suitably qualified individuals to serve as Hearing Chairs under these procedures. The pool shall include individuals reflective of the diversity of the University community.
Such individuals shall have experience in the conduct of administrative proceedings, the presentation of evidence, ruling on the admissibility of evidence, administering deliberations, and drafting written decisions. All Hearing Chairs shall also receive training from the University on the Universityï¿½s definition of Sexual Harassment; the scope of the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities; how to conduct the various procedures and hearing specified herein; how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias; relevance of questions and evidence, including when questions and evidence about a Complainantï¿½s sexual history are not relevant; and training on any audio or video technology that may be used to effectuate the pre-hearing conference or hearing.
The Administrative Officer shall select a member of the pool to serve as Hearing Chair giving due regard to factors such as the individualï¿½s availability to promptly conduct a hearing; the individualï¿½s general familiarity with the particular aspect of the Universityï¿½s operations from which the Formal Complaint arose; potential conflicts of interest that may exist based on the identity of the parties or subject matter involved; and the relative equal distribution of cases across the pool.
After the Administrative Officer selects the Hearing Chair, the Administrative Officer will provide the parties with written notice of the Hearing Chairï¿½s selection. Such notice shall advise the parties that they have three days from receipt of the notice to advise the Administrative Officer of any objection to the selected Hearing Chair based on a claimed conflict of interest or bias.
If any party claims a conflict of interest or bias on the part of the selected Hearing Chair, the Administrative Officer shall determine whether, in fact, such a conflict of interest or bias exists. If the Administrative Officer determines a conflict of interest or bias exists, the Administrative Officer shall select a new Hearing Chair and provide the parties with written notice as specified in this section. If the Administrative Officer determines that a conflict of interest or bias does not exist, the Administrative Officer shall notify the parties in writing, and the matter will proceed with the identified Hearing Chair.
After the selection of the Hearing Chair, and prior to the selection of a Hearing Panel, the Hearing Chair, in consultation with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and the Administrative Officer, will review the final investigation report, together with all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint, and determine whether the Formal Complaint should be dismissed for any one or more of the following grounds:
The Complainant has provided the Title IX Coordinator written notice that the Complainant wishes to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed);
Specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint, or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed).
In the event the Hearing Chair determines that a Formal Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to this section, the Hearing Chair will provide written notice of dismissal to the parties and advise them of their right to appeal as specified herein. The Hearing Chair may refer the dismissed allegations for resolution by other University offices, as appropriate.
If the Formal Complaint is not dismissed, the Administrative Officer shall select two individuals to serve as the Hearing Panel. At least one of the two individuals selected must share the same status as the Respondent (i.e., faculty, student, or staff). Such individuals shall be selected giving due regard to factors such as the individualï¿½s availability to promptly participate in a hearing; the individualï¿½s general familiarity with the particular aspect of the Universityï¿½s operations from which the Formal Complaint arose; potential conflicts of interest that may exist based on the identity of the parties or subject matter involved; and the relative equal distribution of cases across the pool.
Such individuals shall be drawn from a pool of suitably qualified individuals. The pool shall include students, faculty, and staff. Student members shall be appointed by the Vice Provost for Student Affairs in consultation with the Student Senate President. Faculty members shall be appointed by the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor in consultation with the Faculty Senate President. Staff members shall be appointed by the Vice Provost for Operations in consultation with the Staff Senate President.
The pool shall include individuals reflective of the diversity of the University community, including individuals from various schools and departments. Such individuals shall receive training from the University on the Universityï¿½s definition of Sexual Harassment; the scope of the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities; the individualï¿½s role at the hearing as specified herein; how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias; relevance of questions and evidence, including when questions and evidence about a Complainantï¿½s sexual history are not relevant; and training on any audio or video technology that may be used to effectuate the pre-hearing conference or hearing.
After the Administrative Officer selects the Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer will provide the parties with written notice of the Hearing Panelï¿½s selection. Such notice shall advise the parties that the parties have three days from receipt of the notice to advise the Administrative Officer of any objection a party may have based on a claimed conflict of interest or bias.
If any party claims a conflict of interest or bias on the part of a member of the selected Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer shall determine whether, in fact, such a conflict of interest or bias exists. If the Administrative Officer determines a conflict of interest or bias exists, the Administrative Officer shall select a new member of the Hearing Panel and provide the parties with written notice as specified in this section. If the Administrative Officer determines that a conflict of interest or bias does not exist, the Administrative Officer shall notify the parties, in writing, and the matter will proceed with the identified Hearing Panel.
After the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel are selected, the Administrative Officer will send written notice to the parties notifying them of the deadline for the parties to submit any written response to the investigation report; a date for the pre-hearing conference; and a date and time for the hearing (to including an anticipated length in hours). Neither the pre-hearing conference, nor the hearing itself, may be held any earlier than fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of transmittal of the written notice specified in this section.
To the extent the party disagrees with the investigation report, any argument or commentary regarding such disagreement;
Any evidence that a party did not have a reasonable opportunity to provide during the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigation or that the party believes was improperly excluded by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX;
Any argument that evidence should be categorically excluded from consideration at the hearing based on privilege, relevancy, the prohibition on the use of sexual history specified herein, or for any other reason;
A list of any witnesses that the party contends should be called to attend the hearing pursuant to an attendance notice issued by the Administrative Officer;
A list of any witnesses that the party intends to bring to the hearing without an attendance notice issued by the Hearing Chair;
The name and contact information of the Advisor who will accompany the party at the pre-hearing conference and hearing;
If the party does not have an Advisor who will accompany the party at the hearing, a request that the University provide an Advisor for purposes of assisting the party in preparing for the hearing and conducting questioning at the hearing.
Argument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint are supported by a preponderance of the evidence; and
Prior to the hearing, the Hearing Chair will conduct a pre-hearing conference with the parties and their Advisors. By default, the pre-hearing conference will be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology. However, upon request of either party, or in the Hearing Chairï¿½s discretion, the pre-hearing conference may take the form of separate, sequential meetings between the Hearing Chair and each party, whether conducted virtually or in-person.
During the pre-hearing conference, the Hearing Chair will discuss the hearing procedures with the parties; address matters raised in the partiesï¿½ written responses to the investigation report, as the Hearing Chair deems appropriate; discuss whether any stipulations may be made to expedite the hearing; discuss the witnesses the parties have requested be served with notices of attendance and/or witnesses the parties plan to bring to the hearing without a notice of attendance; and resolve any other matters that the Hearing Chair determines, in the Hearing Chairï¿½s discretion, should be resolved before the hearing.
After the pre-hearing conference, the Administrative Officer will transmit notices of attendance to any University employee (i.e. administrator, faculty, or staff) or student whose attendance is requested at the hearing as a witness. The notice will request the subject to appear at the hearing at the specified date and time and advise the subject to contact the Administrative Officer immediately if there is a scheduling conflict.
The subject of an attendance notice should notify any manager, faculty member, coach, or other supervisor, as necessary, if attendance at the hearing will conflict with job duties, classes, or other obligations. All such managers, faculty members, coaches, and other supervisors will be encouraged to excuse the subject of the obligation, or provide some other accommodation, so that the subject may attend the hearing as specified in the notice.
The University has no control over the schedule or availability of any witness who is not an employee or a student, and a notice of attendance will not be issued to anyï¿½ such third-party individual. The University also does not have the authority to compel the attendance and testimony of student witnesses.
Prior to commencement of the hearing, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will review the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX's final investigation report and all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. This review of materials is provisional and intended to provide background and orientation to the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel in preparing for the hearing. The Hearing Chair must eventually exclude from consideration in deliberation any evidence developed during the investigation that is deemed inadmissible at the hearing.
The purpose of the hearing is for the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel to receive relevant testimonial and non-testimony evidence; to resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence standard; and to determine whether the facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations in the Formal Complaint as a violation of the Sexual Harassment Policy. The hearing will operate from a presumption that the Respondent is not responsible for the alleged misconduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made final.
The hearing is not a formal judicial proceeding and strict rules of evidence do not apply except as otherwise set forth in these procedures and as requried by law.
The Administrative Officer will assist the Hearing Chair in arranging the logistics of the hearing including, but not limited to, securing a suitable space on campus, if the hearing is to be held in person or to secure access to appropriate technology if the hearing is to be held virtually. The Administrative Officer will also ensure that the hearing (but not deliberation) is audio or video recorded.
The hearing will be conducted live, with simultaneous and contemporaneous participation by the parties and their Advisors. By default, the hearing will be conducted with the Hearing Chair, Hearing Panel, the parties, the Advisors, witnesses, and other necessary University personnel together in the same physical location. However, upon request of either party, the parties will be separated into different rooms with technology enabling the parties to participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by video and audio.
In the Hearing Chairï¿½s discretion, the hearing may be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology.
The Hearing Chair oversees the hearing process, rules on questions of relevance and admissibility, resolves all procedural disputes, questions parties and witnesses, and deliberates and votes with the Hearing Panel to determine responsibility for the allegations in the Formal Complaint at the conclusion of the hearing process. The Hearing Chair is responsible for maintaining decorum and professionalism in the hearing. The Hearing Chair has discretion to interpret and apply these procedures in any manner that is not clearly unreasonable and is consistent with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulation.
The Hearing Panel reviews the investigation report and hearing files in advance of the hearing, questions parties and witnesses when invited to do so by the Hearing Chair, and deliberates and votes with the Hearing Chair to determine responsibility for the allegations in the Formal Complaint at the conclusion of the hearing process.
The hearing is closed to all persons except the parties, their Advisors, the investigator, the Hearing Chair, the Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer, and other necessary University personnel as determined by the Hearing Chair. With the exception of the investigator and the parties, witnesses will be sequestered until such time as their testimony is complete.
Immediately prior to convening the hearing, the Hearing Chair will ensure that an audio or video recording of the hearing is being made by the Administrative Officer and that the hearing room is cleared of all individuals who are not permitted to be present during the hearing. The Hearing Chair will thenï¿½ convene the hearing and clearly state for the record the date, time, and location of the hearing; the names of the Complainant and Respondent; the parties present at the hearing; any accommodations that have been provided at the request of a party or in theï¿½ Universityï¿½s discretion; whether all or a portion of the hearing is being conducted virtually; and any other introductory matters that the Hearing Chair deems appropriate.
After convening the hearing, the Hearing Chair will call the investigator to give an overview of the investigation process. Thereafter, the investigator will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from each partyï¿½s Advisor commencing first with questioningï¿½ from the Advisor for the Complainant followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent. The investigator will not provide testimony about credibility or whether the investigator believes that the facts support a finding that a policy violation has or has not occurred.
After questioning of the investigator is complete, the Hearing Chair will invite the Complainant to provide a statement regarding the events in question and identify and comment on any non-testimonial evidence the Complainant believes is relevant. After the Complainant has made a statement, or waivedï¿½ the right to make a statement, the Complainant will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent.
After questioning of the Complainant is complete, the Hearing Chair will invite the Respondent to provide a statement to the Hearing Chair regarding the events in question and to identify and comment on any non-testimonial evidence the Respondent believes is relevant. After the Respondent has made a statement, or waived the right to make a statement, the Respondent will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Complainant.
After questioning of the parties is complete, witnesses will be called to testify in the order determined by the Hearing Chair. Unlike the parties, witnesses will not be invited to make a statement but, instead, will be subject to questioning from the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from each partyï¿½s Advisor commencing first with questioning from the Advisor for the Complainant followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent.
After the questioning of the parties and witnesses is complete, the Hearing Chair will identify any portion of the evidence developed during the investigation that the Hearing Chair has determined should be excluded from the hearing record based on rulings made at the pre-hearing conference, during the hearing itself, or for any other reason. The Hearing Chair will then provide the parties a final opportunity to raise any additional objections to inclusion of any other portions of the investigation record into evidence andï¿½ resolve any such objections. All evidence from the investigation and hearing not specifically excluded by the Hearing Chair shall be deemed admitted into the hearing record and may be considered by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel as part of the deliberation.
After the Hearing Chair has ruled on the exclusion of any evidence developed during the investigation, the Hearing Chair will invite the Complainant to make a closing argument. After the Complainant has made a closing argument, or waived the right to make a closing argument, the Hearing Chair will invite the Respondent to make a closing argument.
After closing arguments are complete, the Hearing Chair will conclude the hearing. Thereafter, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will enter into deliberation, which shall be closed to all other persons with the exception of the Universityï¿½s legal counsel, whom the Hearing Chair may invite for the purpose of providing advice to the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel.
During the hearing, the parties and their Advisors shall have access to the investigation report and a copy of all evidence developed by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigation directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. Such evidence may be utilized in the questioning of witnesses where relevant. Non-testimonial evidence utilized during the hearing shall be marked and referred to in such a manner as to make it clearly identifiable by audio (i.e., such as sequential marking of ï¿½exhibitsï¿½).
Throughout the hearing, the Hearing Chair will independently and contemporaneously screen all questions for relevance and resolve any contemporaneous evidentiary objections raised by the parties. If the Hearing Chair does not exclude a question, it is presumed the Hearing Chair has deemed the question relevant and admissible. The Hearing Chair may exclude evidence that is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative.
The Hearing Chair will have discretion to set the overall length of the hearing and may set time limits for statements of the parties, questioning of parties and witnesses, and closing arguments. A hearing will not exceed seven hours in length absent extraordinary circumstances. Once a hearing is commenced, it will be continued to another day only for good cause as determined by the Hearing Chair. The Hearing Chair has discretion to schedule breaks during the hearing.
In accordance with University Senate Code Article XII, during the pre-hearing conference and hearing, the Complainant and Respondent have the right to be represented by an Advisor or Counsel of their choice at their own cost and expense.
In the event a party is not able to secure an Advisor or Counsel to attend the hearing and conduct cross-examination of witnesses on behalf of that party, the University will provide the party an Advisor, without fee or charge, to conduct questioning on behalf of witnesses on behalf of the party at the hearing. The University will have sole discretion to select the Advisor it provides, but may consider input from the party. The Advisor the University provides may be, but is not required to be, an attorney.
The University is not required to provide a party with an Advisor in any circumstance except where the party does not have an Advisor present at the hearing. Except for conducting the questioning of witnesses during the hearing, an Advisor assigned by the University will play a passive role and is not permitted to communicate on behalf of a party, insist that communication flow through the Advisor, or communicate with the University about the matter. University-appointed Advisors are not permitted to make objections, present arguments, or engage in any other active role apart from questioning of witnesses.
In addition to an advisor of their choice, a party may be accompanied to the hearing by up to two support persons of their choice, provided a support person cannot be a witness. The support persons play a passive role and are not permitted to communicate on behalf of a party, insist that communication flow through the support person, or communicate with the University about the matter. Support persons are not permitted to make objections, present arguments, or engage in any active role.
During the hearing, evidence regarding a Complainantï¿½s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainantï¿½s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainantï¿½s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Complainant who affirmatively uses information otherwise considered irrelevant by this section may be deemed to have waived the protections of this section.
During the hearing, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel are not permitted to access, consider, disclose, permit questioning concerning, or otherwise use the following types of records unless the party holding the privilege has provided prior, written consent:
A partyï¿½s records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professional or paraprofessionalï¿½s capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party; or
Information or records protected from disclosure by any other legally recognized privilege, such as the attorney client privilege.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party who affirmatively uses information otherwise protected by this section may be deemed to have waived the protections of this section.
All parties, Advisors, and other persons present at a hearing are required to act professionally, maintain decorum, and abide by the policy, these procedures, and any other rules specified by the Hearing Chair. The requirements of professionalism and decorum apply to all aspects of the hearing, including the manner in which questions are posed to parties and witnesses. Any party, Advisor, or other person who materially disrupts the proceeding or violates applicable policies, procedures, and rules, may be barred from further participation and/or have their participation limited, as the case may be, by the Hearing Chair.
Wherever these procedures contemplate questioning of a party or witnesses, the Hearing Chair has discretion to permit more than one round of questioning. In addition to ruling on questions of relevancy, the Hearing Chair may limit cumulative and redundant questioning.
After the hearing is complete, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will privately deliberate over the matter. The deliberation will not be audio or video recorded. The deliberation will include an objective evaluation of all relevant evidence collected during the investigation, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, together with testimonial and non-testimonial evidence received at the hearing. While deliberating, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will ensure that any credibility determinations made are not based on a personï¿½s status as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness. The Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will take care to exclude from consideration any evidence that was ruled inadmissible at the pre-hearing conference, during the hearing, or by other operation of these procedures, or as required by law.
In deciding what the facts are, the Hearing Panel will decide what testimony and evidence it believes and what testimony and evidence it does not believe. The Hearing Panel may believe all of what a witness said, or only part of it, or none of it.
In deciding what testimony to believe, the Hearing Panel should consider the opportunity the witness had to have seen or heard the things testified about, the witness' memory, any motives that witness may have for testifying a certain way, the manner of the witness while testifying, whether that witness said something different at an earlier time, the general reasonableness of the testimony, and the extent to which the testimony is consistent with any other evidence that is believed.
In deciding whether or not to believe a witness, the Hearing Panel should consider that people sometimes hear or see things differently and sometimes forget things and therefore should consider whether a contradiction is an innocent misrecollection or lapse of memory or an intentional falsehood, and that may depend on whether it has to do with an important fact or only a small detail.
The Hearing Panel shall draw no inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a partyï¿½s or witnessï¿½s absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions. However, the hearing panel may consider in determining the weight of the evidence the extent to which the witnessï¿½ testimony or other evidence has been subject to cross-examination, particularly on matters that are material to the outcome of the case.
The Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., ï¿½more likely than notï¿½) standard and reach a determination regarding whether the facts that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. In the deliberation, the Hearing Chair and each member of the Hearing Panel have one vote. Abstentions are not permitted. A majority vote controls.
In the event the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel determine that the Respondent is responsible for violating the Sexual Harassment Policy the Hearing Chair will, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with the appropriate administrator with disciplinary authority over the Respondent and such administrator will determine any discipline to be imposed. The Hearing Chair will also, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with the Title IX Coordinator who will determine whether and to what extent ongoing support measures or other remedies will be provided to the Complainant.
After reaching a determination and consulting with the appropriate University administrator and Title IX Coordinator, the Hearing Chair will prepare a written decision that will include:
Identification of the allegations potentially constituting Sexual Harassment made in the Formal Complaint;
A description of the procedural steps taken by the University upon receipt of the Formal Complaint, through issuance of the written decision, including notification to the parties, interviews with the parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather non-testimonial evidence, and the date, location, and people who were present at or presented testimony at the hearing;
Articulate findings of fact, made under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that support the determination;
A statement of, and rationale for, each allegation that constitutes a separate potential incident of Sexual Harassment, including a determination regarding responsibility for each separate potential incident;
The discipline determined by the appropriate University administrator and any ongoing support measures or other remedies as determined by the Title IX Coordinator; and
The written determination will be signed by the Hearing Chair on behalf of the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel. The written determination will then be transmitted by the Administrative Officer to the parties, the Administrative Officer, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, and other University officials, as appropriate. Transmittal of the written determination to the parties concludes the hearing process, subject to any right of appeal. In a typical case, the written determination will be transmitted within fourteen (14) days of completion of the hearing, but this time period may vary depending on a range of factors including the complexity of the allegations at issue.
Either party may appeal the dismissal of a Formal Complaint or written determination, as the case may be, to an appeals panel of the University Judicial Board. Appeal is permitted one or more of the following grounds, in addition to those grounds specified in University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.7.3.:
There is new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination or dismissal was made, that could have affected the outcome;
The Title IX Coordinator, investigator, Hearing Chair, or Hearing Panel, as the case may be, had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or against the individual Complainant or Respondent, that affected the outcome;
The party was deprived of a right guaranteed by some other University policy or standard and the deprivation of that right affected the outcome.
A party must file an appeal within fourteen (14) days of the date they receive notice of dismissal or written determination appealed from. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Chair of the University Judicial Board. If an appeal is untimely or fails to invoke one or more of the permitted grounds for appeal, it will be dismissed.
If a timely appeal is filed invoking one or more of the permitted grounds, it shall be processed and heard in the manner specified in USRR Article VI, Section 7.
The determination of a Formal Complaint becomes final when the time for appeal has passed with no party filing an appeal or, if any appeal is filed, at the point when the University has resolved all appeals, either by dismissal or by transmittal of a written decision from the appeals panel. No further review or appeal is permitted beyond appeal to the University Judicial Board as specified herein.
The Title IX Coordinator, Administrative Officer, Hearing Chair, Hearing Panel, and appeals panel will be free of any conflicts of interest or bias. Any party who believes one or more of these individuals has a material conflict of interest or material bias must raise the concern promptly so that the University may evaluate the concern and find a substitute, if appropriate. The failure of a party to timely raise a concern of a conflict of interest or bias may result in a waiver of the issue.
Parties are expected to raise any objections, concerns, or complaints about the processes specified herein in a prompt and timely manner so that the University may evaluate the matter and address it, if appropriate. The failure of a party to timely raise an objection, concern, or complaint may result in a waiver of the issue.
The recording of the hearing will be made only by the University and is considered property of the University, subject to any right of access that a party may have under this policy, FERPA, and other applicable federal, state, or local laws. Only the University is permitted to make a recording of the hearing. The surreptitious recording of any meeting, interview, hearing, or other interaction contemplated by these procedures is prohibited. Any party who wishes to transcribe a hearing by use of a transcriptionist must seek preapproval from theï¿½ Administrative Officer.
It is a violation of these procedures for any person to provide testimony or other evidence that the person knows to be false or in bad faith.
The University retains discretion to interpret and apply these procedures in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable, even if the Universityï¿½s interpretation or application differs from the interpretation of the parties.
Despite the Universityï¿½s reasonable efforts to anticipate all eventualities in drafting these procedures, it is possible unanticipated or extraordinary circumstances may not be specifically or reasonably addressed by the express policy language, in which case the University retains discretion to respond to the unanticipated or extraordinary circumstance in a way that is not clearly unreasonable.
These procedures are not contractual in nature. Accordingly, the University retains discretion to revise these procedures at any time, and for any reason. The University may apply revisions to an active case provided that doing so is not clearly unreasonable.

PolicyPurpose:ï¿½To outline the Universityï¿½s policies on nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and affirmative action.
Campus:ï¿½EdwardsLawrenceJuniper GardensParsonsYoderTopekaMedical Center, Kansas CitySalinaWichitaPolicy Statement:ï¿½As a premier learning and research institution, the University of Kansas must continuously address issues of diversity and multiculturalism. Every member of the university community is expected to engage in action that leads towards the development of a more democratic and inclusive community. Proactive efforts towards increasing diversity and the elimination of discrimination are necessary in our university.
In accordance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11246, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Jobs for Veterans Act of 2002, the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination and all other applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination statutes, the University of Kansas prohibits discrimination.
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, and genetic information in the university's programs and activities.ï¿½ Retaliation is also prohibited by university policy. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policies and are the Title IX coordinators for their respective campuses: Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, 913-588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas medical center campuses).
The University of Kansas is committed to the full participation of previously excluded or neglected classes of people. Thus, it is also the policy of the university to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, and gender expression. The university's nondiscrimination policy extends to employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions and all other educational programs and activities of the university and its affiliates. It also extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and associates that may arise as a result of a discrimination complaint. Leaders in the university community continuously examine all areas of the institution, make policy decisions, and implement strategies to eliminate and prevent discrimination wherever necessary. Reports of discrimination shall be evaluated promptly and acted upon in the manner deemed necessary by the appropriate faculty, staff, and administrators and as prescribed by the appropriate grievance procedure.
The University of Kansas is also proud of its goal to help all individuals realize their potential. To this end, the university is committed to providing an equal opportunity for all qualified individuals to be considered for employment, benefits and conditions of employment, educational programs and activities, regardless of race, religion, color, ethnicity, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic information. University leaders and supervisory personnel shall recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles utilizing only valid requirements related to the position functions. A university community that provides equal opportunity in hiring and all conditions of employment will make significant strides towards the elimination of discrimination. Thus, the University of Kansas applauds every effort to create a positive working and learning environment for all individuals.
In addition to providing a discrimination-free community and equal opportunity for all persons, the university is committed to taking specific, result-oriented steps to increase the number of historically underrepresented persons and increase overall diversity. Cultural and intellectual diversity are critical components of premier learning communities. Thus, the university will actively recruit and encourage applications from underrepresented group members and will endeavor to provide a positive and supportive environment for members of these groups.
The university shall monitor its efforts to increase diversity through its Affirmative Action Plans. The university's Plans shall outline strategic initiatives and set goals to increase the representation of underrepresented group members.
Paramount to the success of the affirmative action program are the actions of university leaders. University officials at all levels are expected to establish a plan and implement procedures that help to meet the university's goals. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff are charged with the responsibility of responding to complaints of discrimination, monitoring university procedures regarding equal opportunity, setting goals, and monitoring and evaluating the university's progress towards its affirmative action goals.

Related Procedures:ï¿½Any person who has a question regarding the applicable laws or policies, or who feels discriminated against, is encouraged to contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, 1082 Dole Human Development Center, Lawrence, KS 66045, phone 785-864-6414; email civilrights@ku.edu.; or, for the Medical Center: Dorris Mbogo, Director, Equal Opportunity and Academic Compliance Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, phone 913-588-5964, 711 TTY, email dmbogo@kumc.edu.
Any person who would like to report discrimination on the basis of sex, or who has an inquiry concerning the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the institutionï¿½s education programs and activities, should contact the KU Title IX Coordinator, Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, at 785-864-6414 or civilrights@ku.edu; or the KU Medical Center Title IX Coordinator: Natalie Holick, Associate Vice Chancellor for Integrity & Compliance, Equal Opportunity and Academic Compliance Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, at 913-588-8011, 711 TTY, nholick@kumc.edu. ï¿½Reports also may be made to the Office of Civil Rights (Region VII), Department of Education at 816-268-0550; the Office of Civil Rights Department of Education website provides additional contact information and detailed information on how to file a complaint.
Definitions:ï¿½Sexual Harassment:ï¿½ï¿½Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment: ï¿½Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individualï¿½s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment: ï¿½Hostile Environment Sexual Harassmentï¿½ is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the Universityï¿½s education programs and activities.
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a manner that does not interfere with First Amendment Free Speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generallyï¿½not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employeeï¿½s official duties.ï¿½ Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employeeï¿½s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive.ï¿½ In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.

The Museum Studies Program (MUSE) offers training in the discipline of Museum Studies, and (1) prepares graduates for professional careers in museums and related institutions; (2) encourages innovative multidisciplinary research in museum studies; and (3) seeks opportunities for engagement by students and faculty to enhance the professionalism of museums in the state and the region. The graduate program in Museum Studies provides a comprehensive overview of the discipline, opportunities for mastering core components of museum practice, avenues for exploring museums from an interdisciplinary perspective, solid grounding in contemporary issues facing museums, and possibilities for research to develop new and innovative approaches in the field.
The program is concerned with the principles and practices of acquisition, management, conservation, and utilization of museum and archival collections; the development and implementation of educational, exhibition, and research programs and services for the public; the nature and history of organizations housing collections; and the philosophy and practices of administration pertaining to these organizations.
Since 1981, the Museum Studies Program has offered professional training for careers in museums, historical agencies, and related institutions. The Museum Studies Program offers a range of courses that address the theories, history, techniques, and problems common to museums and cultural institutions, as well as the specialized operations of such institutions. Students receive classroom and field training in methods and subject matter in their chosen area of concentration. The University of Kansas offers a broad range of opportunities for museum studies training and experience beyond the classroom, including museums of art, classics, history, natural history, politics, and athletics; archival, manuscript, and rare book collections; historical societies; as well as related administrative and research activities. A graduate of the program is prepared for professional practice in the world of museums.
The mission of the Museum Studies Program is to produce graduates prepared to advance museums, historical and cultural agencies, and similar institutions in the state, region, and nation. Drawing on the expertise of outstanding faculty, the skills of accomplished area museum professionals, and the rich resources of institutions at KU and in nearby communities, the Museum Studies Program:
1. The Museum Studies Program is administered by the Director in consultation with the Museum Studies Executive Committee (see II(B)2) and includes faculty and staff in various roles.
2. The Program is bound in its action by University regulations, particularly as expressed in the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff. Reference should be made to these regulations in all cases since the bylaws and other policies and practices of the department are supplementary to the main body of University regulation.
a. The Director is the administrative and operating head of Museum Studies, the chairperson of the Museum Studies Executive Committee, and an ex officio member of any other Museum Studies committees or subcommittees. The Director is the official representative of Museum Studies with other departments, divisions, programs, and administrators of the University, except in those cases when the Director or the faculty, acting jointly and with the Director's consent, specifically designate another Museum Studies faculty member, instructor, or administrative staff to represent the Director.
b. The Director is responsible for the smooth functioning of the Museum Studies Program. The Director calls Museum Studies Executive Committee meetings, directs and oversees Museum Studies programs, initiates and/or carries through curricular and other changes in the program, manages faculty appointed in MUSE, appoints and oversees Museum Studies staff and lecturers, supervises the Museum Studies budget, applies Museum Studies and University rules as appropriate, and performs other normal tasks as required by the College and other University administrative units.
c. The Director serves at the pleasure of the Executive Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and reports to the contact Associate Dean for the Program.
e. In those cases in which MUSE's position has been clearly reached in consultation with the Museum Studies Executive Committee, the Director acts and speaks for the unit. Consequently, in all matters on which the Director needs to act on behalf of MUSE, it is desirable that the Director should ascertain by consultation the will of MUSE, and act accordingly. Consultation may take many forms. This statement is in no way to be construed as inhibiting the right of the Director to speak as an individual faculty member when appropriate.
f. The Directorï¿½s term in office is determined by the Executive Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, but is usually for a period of three to five years, renewable. The Director is appointed by the Executive Dean, after an appropriate search conducted by a search committee comprising MUSE faculty and affiliates. Searches are governed by the University and College regulations and procedures and by such additional procedures as may be adopted.
g. The Director is responsible for updating procedures and enacting changes approved by the Museum Studies Executive Committee.
a. Given the historically small number of faculty appointed in the program as tenured and tenure-track professors, teaching professors, and multi-term lecturers; and in recognition of the contributions made to teaching and advising in the program by the staff at university museums, the Museum Studies Executive Committee is convened to advise the Director and represents the interests of varied stakeholders in the program.
b. The Museum Studies Executive Committee (MSEC) advises the Director concerning program affairs including (but not necessarily limited to): development of program policies, oversight of the academic quality of the program, establishment of admissions criteria and standards, and budgetary and curricular concerns that affect the program as a whole. The academic design of the program is established by guidelines set by the MSEC.
d. The MSEC is composed of all tenured and tenure-track professors, teaching professors, and multi-term lecturers with FTE appointments in the program, two non-faculty representatives of campus museums, and the President of the Museum Studies Student Organization (MSO).
e. Campus museum representatives are appointed upon recommendation by the Museum Studies Director and serve a three-year term, with the possibility of one renewal term.
(1) Their ability to advise students concerning academic courses and programs of study in preparation for entry into the museum field.
(2) Their ability to advise students on careers in museums, cultural or historical agencies, archives, or related institutions.
(5) Their ability to represent the diversity of disciplines and institutions affiliated with the Museum Studies Program.
g. The President of the MSO is elected annually by the graduate students and serves a one-year term to represent the interests of the student caucus. Should the MSO fail to elect a president, the Director will appoint a second-year student to represent student interests.
(1) The MSO President has a vote on most matters; however, should personnel or hiring decisions arise, the MSO President may express the views of the student body, but does not participate in voting.
h. In the case of necessary absences, an appropriate alternate (i.e., another campus museum representative, an officer of the MSO) may be designated to serve as a voting member for that meeting.
(1) The Museum Studies Executive Committee meeting is attended by all members of the MSEC and is open to other faculty and staff of the program.
(2) The MSEC will meet at least once per semester and, in practice, should meet once a month to attend to regular business.
(3) The Director will provide an agenda for the meeting no later than 48 hours in advance, with all supporting documentation for any matters on the agenda subject to the same deadline. Minutes of the meeting will be taken by administrative staff; copies of the minutes will be distributed to the MSEC following the meeting and kept on file.
(4) Extraordinary MSEC meetings may be called by the Director or the MSEC as necessary according to the guidelines stipulated in II.2.j.(3).
(5) MSEC meetings are held with the purposes of keeping the committee members informed of the status of the Program; to solicit input and advice to assist the Director; and to discuss and vote on Museum Studies policy changes.
(a) A quorum at all MSEC meetings shall consist of not less than one-half plus one of the voting members of the body.
(b) If, except for revisions of these Bylaws (see IV.A below) or of the Program Description (see IV.B below), any business before the MSEC requires a formal vote, a majority of the voting membership must be present and a majority of those voting shall decide the issue.
(c) Except in special circumstances generally recognized in parliamentary practice (Robert's Rules of Order being the standard reference), each member of the MSEC may vote on any motion before the MSEC.
(1) An Admissions Committee will be established each year to review applications to the Masterï¿½s program.
(2) The Admissions Committee will be composed of the Director and at least three Museum Studies faculty and affiliates. The members will be appointed by the Director, in consultation with the Executive Committee.
(3) Other KU faculty may, on occasion, be asked to review applications from students whose interests or background are relevant to the faculty memberï¿½s expertise.
(4) The Director evaluates applications for the Certificate program and, if necessary, seeks counsel from MUSE faculty and staff.
(1) Membership: Individuals who have expertise or interest in Museum Studies and who have the desire to help the Museum Studies Program fulfill its mission. Such members may include but are not limited to: KU faculty, KU museum professionals, alumni, representatives from state and regional professional museum organizations, local professionals, and scholars outside of KU.
(2) Duties: The Advisory Board will meet once a year and receive a report from the Director and other faculty about the program and its activities. Members of the Advisory Board are asked to make recommendations to improve the program. Recommendations are non-binding until approved by the Executive Committee.
b. Affiliate members include courtesy faculty and staff employed by the university who teach courses, advise students, and otherwise support the mission of the Museum Studies Program.

As a nationally and internationally prominent department at a major research university, KU historians appreciate the complexity and diversity of the human experience, question simple explanations, evaluate evidence in multiple forms, and offer insightful interpretations with clarity of expression. We
Educate undergraduate students about the value of intellectual curiosity, empathetic and critical thinking, and historical understanding.
The Department of History seeks to work with others across KU, throughout the country, and around the world to foster understanding of the complex origins of todayï¿½s world and its challenges and to aid in intelligent decision-making about the future.
We aspire to be a leading student-centered, research-intensive department that attracts and retains talented and intellectually curious students from across Kansas and beyond. We aim to have strong faculty and staff members who contribute to the department, the University, the community, and the world through the excellence of our teaching, research, and service. We seek to provide a welcoming, supportive environment for learning and working where differences are valued and all persons are offered an equitable opportunity to achieve their academic and professional goals.
We believe that a critical understanding of the past is foundational to a sustainable future in which social and cultural diversity is appreciated. We accomplish our mission through the lens of shared values. Our goal is to be:
The department recognizes that it is bound in its action by University regulations, particularly as expressed in the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff. Reference should be made to these regulations in all cases since the bylaws and other policies and practices of the department are supplementary to the main body of University regulation.
Within the limits imposed by these bylaws, the Chairperson of the department shall conduct departmental meetings in the manner most likely to ensure free, open, and orderly discussion. When questions of procedure arise, appeal should be made to the latest edition of Robertï¿½s Rules of Order.
Before the beginning of classes each semester, the Chairperson will typically schedule five regular departmental meetings (including the annual convocation), to be held at three- to four- week intervals over the course of the semester. Except in exceptional circumstances announced well in advance, these meetings will be held from 10:30 to noon on Friday and last no more than one and one-half hours.
Voting members of the department shall consist of those holding tenure-track professorships, teaching professorships, and other continuing multi-year appointments in the department (such as lecturers or visiting professors), as well as those students who have been duly elected or appointed as representatives to the department. The voting membership will be confined to persons holding tenure-track or continuing multi-year appointments in the department for final hiring decisions, promotion and tenure recommendations, faculty and student evaluation, policies governing student academic standards, and other matters explicitly delimited by departmental bylaws. Student representatives cannot vote on these matters, and in some cases do not attend meetings in which these matters are discussed. Professors emeriti of the department are encouraged to participate in meetings in an advisory capacity, but do not have a voting role.
At departmental meetings, the number of student representatives will be determined as follows: students will represent a number less than or equal to 20 percent of the permanent faculty. Two of these voting members will be undergraduates; the balance of these voting members will be graduate students.
Graduate student members are elected annually by the departmentï¿½s History Graduate Student Organization (HGSO).
Undergraduate representatives are recommended by the Undergraduate Committee and appointed by the Chairperson.
A quorum must be present at a departmental meeting in order for any vote to be held. Presentations and discussions may take place in the absence of a quorum. A quorum will be determined by the following procedure:
At the start of each semester, the quorum number will be calculated by counting the number of faculty holding tenure-track or continuing multi-year appointments, dividing this number by three and rounding up to the nearest whole number.
A quorum is constituted when the number of faculty holding tenure-track or continuing appointments present at a departmental meeting meets or exceeds the quorum number.
The presence of student representative at a meeting does not contribute to the determination of a quorum.
With the exception of bylaws revisions and general announcements, all agenda items must be distributed electronically to the members of the department before noon two business days preceding the meeting at which they will be discussed or acted upon. This rule may be waived by the majority consent of voting members present at the meeting.
The Department Chair may call for a vote via email ballot for time-sensitive business that arises between regularly scheduled departmental meetings. Voting rights for email ballots are the same as voting rights for departmental meetings. For an email vote to be valid, the total number of votes cast by faculty must be greater than or equal to the number needed to constitute a quorum at a regular departmental meeting. Email ballots will be distributed and collected by the departmentï¿½s administrative associate, who will convey the outcome to the Department Chair while protecting the confidentiality of the votes. The Chair will announce these results to the department. Under some circumstances (such as election of members of thePersonnel Committee), the Chair may use paper ballots for holding departmental votes outside regular meetings. Unless otherwise stipulated by departmental bylaws, the rules governing paper ballots will be the same as email ballots.
The right to vote has special importance at departmental meetings called to discuss major issues, such as promotion and tenure recommendations, the appointment of faculty or the Department Chair, and bylaw revisions. If a department member with voting rights on a major issue is unable to attend in person in the course of their professional duties, such as attending an out-of-town conference or research leave, provision can be made to attend and vote at a departmental meeting in a virtual manner using the following procedure:
The absentee shall provide a written statement to the presiding chair that appoints a proxy in attendance at the departmental meeting.
It is the proxyï¿½s responsibility to arrange and handle the interface for the absenteeï¿½s virtual attendance, which should enable the absentee to hear discussion and to communicate questions, comments, and their vote.
When voting, the proxy should fill out a ballot on behalf of the absentee with the direct assistance of the presiding chair, who will then include the ballot in tabulations of the departmental vote, while otherwise protecting its confidentiality.
As an alternative, faculty members unable to attend a meeting in person may submit a concise signed opinion to the presiding chair to be shared during general faculty discussion.
The role of the secretary for each regular and special departmental meeting is to take minutes. The secretary has the responsibility to convey them in a timely manner to the Department Chair and administrative associate, including a complete and accurate text of all formally adopted provisions.ï¿½ The responsibility of secretary will circulate alphabetically through the regular faculty and teaching professors.
The Department Chairperson is the administrative and operating head of the department, the chair of departmental meetings, and an ex officio member of all departmental committees. The Chair is also the representative of the department with other units, departments, divisions, and administrators of the university, except in those cases when another member of the department has been specifically designated to act in that capacity. The Chairï¿½s main duties include:
Administering the undergraduate and graduate academic programs of the unit, including the appointment in consultation with the Personnel Committee of a Director of Undergraduate Studies, Director of Graduate Studies, and committees to oversee these activities.
Reviewing and revising long-range plans for the unit, in consultation with the unitï¿½s Personnel Committee.
Seeking to enhance resources available to the unit by actively seeking internal and external fundingï¿½Developing strategies, implementing plans, and organizing events for fundraising, including maintaining contact information for alumni and donors. Assisting KU Endowment and the College with fundraising initiatives that will benefit the department.
Developing and enhancing research and educational relationships between the unit and other units across the College and University, as well as with agencies outside the University, public and private.
Cultivating future leadership for the department by mentoring faculty members and providing leadership opportunities.
Executing College and University policy within the unit effectively.ï¿½Informing and updating department faculty on changes to College and University policies that affect the History Department, and relaying to department faculty pertinent information from the meetings of chairs and program directors that affects the History Department.
Serving as the main administrator, PI, or co-PI for grants originated by the department. (The PI would typically be a faculty member whose area of expertise lies in the area of the grant.)
Appointing other departmental officers, faculty representatives, and employees to perform designated tasks.
Maintaining, in consultation with the Personnel Committee, accurate, up-to-date versions of departmental bylaws and policies that are posted on the departmental website.
Hearing recommendations and complaints about faculty, staff, or students. When appropriate, the Chair will communicate these to University administration, or when relevant to Annual Faculty Evaluation or committee service, to the Personnel Committee.
B. The Chairperson, when acting in that capacity, routinely speaks and acts on behalf of the department as a whole. Consequently, it is vital for the Chairperson to ascertain the will of the department by consultation and to act on that will. It is recognized that this consultation may take many forms and that this requirement in no way inhibits the right of the Chairperson to speak and act as an individual.
C. The Personnel Committee is designated to serve the Chair in a general advisory capacity, and may advise the Dean on the Chairï¿½s performance when appropriate.
D. The term of office of the Chairperson shall be three to five years. Term length is to be determined by agreement between the incoming chairperson and the Dean of the College, and whatever agreement is reached will be promptly communicated to the department. Extension of the term of office of the Chairperson for more than one year beyond the original term requires consultation with faculty at a departmental meeting.
The selection of the Department Chair should reference current College policy on the matter: see http://policy.ku.edu/CLAS/procedures-for-selection-of-chairs. For the purpose of voting, the selection of a Chair is considered a personnel matter. In the case of an external search, the department will also follow bylaws for faculty appointments. In either case, the following procedure is required:
The Dean meets with voting members of the unit to review procedures and charge them to initiate the search.
Voting members of the department appoint a search committee and name a chair for it. The search committee chair must be a tenured member of the department.
The search committee prepares a position description and presents it to voting members for discussion and approval and then to the College Deanï¿½s Office for final approval.
In conjunction with the Deanï¿½s Office and SSC, the position announcement is uploaded to the Universityï¿½s hiring system and published more broadly if it involves an external search.
The search committee reviews applicants and conducts interviews with the most promising candidates. Traditionally, interviews have been conducted with the committee of the whole.
The search committee presents its recommendations to the unit, and the unitï¿½s voting members identify candidate strengths and weaknesses and vote for their preferred candidate in a manner that will preserve the confidentiality of their votes. Student representatives are encouraged to participate in the initial discussion that follows the search committeeï¿½s recommendation, but are not allowed to vote and should vacate the room during general discussion by faculty entitled to vote on personnel matters. Faculty members must attend the meeting in person or via the procedure for virtual attendance to be eligible to vote.
Voting procedure: After the search committee chair closes discussion, each member entitled to vote on personnel decisions will receive a series of ballots with all finalist names.
Each voting member will vote for their ONE favored candidate and designate any candidate they consider ï¿½unacceptable.ï¿½
Any candidate deemed unacceptable by the majority of voters at any point will be designated unacceptable by the department.
If no candidate receives a majority on the ballot, the lowest vote recipient will be eliminated from consideration on the subsequent ballot. Voting will continue until a majority agrees on a top-ranked candidate.
In the case of a persistent tie, the search committee chair will communicate a tied ranking to the Dean.
The ranking that results from this vote and the list of strengths and weaknesses produced by the search committee (modified as appropriate after meeting discussion) will provide the principal basis for the departmentï¿½s recommendation for appointment to the Dean and other University administration. After ranking is completed, the search committee chair will inform official student representatives of this outcome, so that they can inform other interested students, taking care to protect the confidentiality of the outcome and process.
A. Associate Chairperson: The Associate Chair is appointed and supervised by the Chairperson and has the following duties:
Determining the departmentï¿½s schedule of courses, including which courses are offered and the dates and times of instruction. In setting the course schedule, the Associate Chair sends out a call each fall semester for faculty to recommend courses for the subsequent academic year and consults with the Graduate and Undergraduate Directors and relevant groups of faculty with shared teaching interests.
Overseeing and evaluating the performance of limited-term and multi-year lecturers, visiting professors, and similar appointments, when appropriate.
Taking the place of the Chairperson when they are unavailable or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the Chair, both for internal matters and when representing the department to outside units.
Monitoring student credit hour production and the number of undergraduate majors and minors and pursuing strategies to maintain or grow these numbers.
The Director of Graduate Studies is appointed and supervised by the Chairperson. The main duty of the Director of Graduate Studies is to preside over the departmentï¿½s graduate program and the Graduate Committee. If the Chair and Associate Chair are unable to perform the duties of Chairperson, the Director of Graduate Studies will substitute.
Ensuring that departmental protocols and policies for graduate students conform to College and University standards.
Ministering to the questions and concerns of present, past, and prospective graduate students and of faculty regarding the graduate program.
In collaboration with the History Graduate Student Organization, planning and executing the annual Prospective Students Visit for newly admitted students.
Assigning GTAs to History courses each semester, in consultation with graduate students and instructors of record regarding preference.
Recommending to the Associate Chair advanced graduate students to teach their own History course(s) as Assistant Instructors.
Regularly updating department faculty on the state of the graduate program, including providing faculty with enrollment information at the beginning of every semester, and regular updates on the progress of graduate admissions and matriculation.
The Director of Undergraduate Studies is appointed and supervised by the Chairperson. The main duty of the Director of Undergraduate Studies is to preside over the departmentï¿½s undergraduate program and Undergraduate Committee.
Ensuring that departmental protocols and policies for undergraduate students conform to College and University standards.
Ministering to the questions and concerns of present, past, and prospective undergraduate students and of faculty regarding the undergraduate program.
Coordinating undergraduate course offerings within the department, with other units offering ï¿½meets withï¿½ courses or cross-listed courses.
Coordinating undergraduate advising with the departmentï¿½s advising specialist, and where appropriate, with faculty and other student advisors in the College and University.
Preparing applications for undergraduate student funding and awards internal to the College and University.
Around the twentieth class-day of each semester, soliciting and archiving syllabi for all courses being taught that semester.
D. Department officers are normally given ten-month appointments. The Chairperson will request supplemental summer salary for these positions from the College, and with approval of the Dean, will provide a one-course reduction in teaching responsibilities each year. Upon conclusion of a three-year term in the position, the Chairperson will recommend to the Dean a one-semester Special Research Assignment.
As our official leaders, the Chairperson and Department Officers are primarily responsible for strategic planning for the department and will do so in close consultation with other departmental committees and department members as a whole. Strategic planning involves envisioning desired futures for the department and formulating concrete goals that can be translated into operational plans and actions. It also involves accounting for the financial resources available for achieving these goals and planning for contingencies. Every three to five years, or at moments when requested by the Dean or University administration, such as before and after an External Review, the Chair and Department Officers will draw up a long-term Strategic Plan for the department, which they will submit to the department for discussion and approval. Each academic year, the Chair and Department Officers will make an annual assessment of the Strategic Planï¿½s progress, deficiencies, and intervening contingencies; discuss this assessment at a departmental meeting; and make appropriate alterations and amendments to the Strategic Plan. Whenever possible, this will be done in parallel with the discussion of priorities in hiring, following the procedure outlined under Faculty Appointments.
Procedures for additions to the regular faculty and teaching professors will be governed by the Handbook for Faculty and Unclassified Staff and Guidelines on Academic Appointments of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, available at http://policy.ku.edu/CLAS/academic- appointments. No one may become a permanent member of the department without the support of the majority vote of the members of the department present or virtually present at a regular or special meeting. Student representatives and emeriti faculty may not vote on faculty appointments.
Differential Allocations of Effort are governed by the Provostï¿½s policy, available at: http://policy.ku.edu/provost/DAE. The Department of History normally expects tenured and tenure-track faculty to devote 40 percent of their effort to research, 40 percent to teaching, and 20 percent to service to the university, community, and profession, and it typically applies these weights when evaluating faculty performance. Teaching professors are normally expected to devote 10 percent to research, 75 percent to teaching, and 10 percent to service, with the additional 5 percent of effort allocated by contract to one of those three categories.
Changes in the standard allocation of effort or an existing DAE can be initiated by the faculty member or Department Chair. Reasons for Differential Allocation of Effort can include short- term alterations, such as research-intensive semesters or funded research, or longer-term alterations related to career stage, performance, editorial or administrative appointments, or other issues. Departmental needs take precedence over individual needs when making decisions to alter a faculty memberï¿½s Allocation of Effort, and redistribution must be consistent with the best interests of the unit.
If a faculty member would like to make a DAE agreement, whether temporary or permanent, they should make this request to the Department Chair, who will consult with the appropriate Dean about the feasibility of the request. Any changes to faculty Allocation of Effort will be documented in the faculty memberï¿½s personnel file and made available to the Personnel Committee for the purpose of annual evaluation. If the faculty member and Chairperson disagree about the DAE, the faculty member may request a non-binding review by an ad-hoc faculty committee designated to hear such matters. Long-term DAEs must be reviewed at least every three years.
Each year as requested by the Dean, voting members of the department will suggest and discuss potential hires and produce, by vote, a ranked list of priorities in hiring. The Chairperson will initiate this process and convey this list to the Dean with appropriate explanations for those hires and their ranking.
Discussion and voting procedure: In advance of the departmental meeting at which potential hires will be discussed, the ranked list of suggestions for future hires from the previous year will be distributed to members of the department. Each voting member of the department (including student representatives) is requested to submit a ranked list of up to five suggestions for future hires and turn in this preliminary ranking to the departmentï¿½s administrative associate for tabulation. In consultation with Department Officers, the Department Chair will group suggestions that are very similar for the purpose of tabulating this preliminary list and to solicit further suggestions inspired by departmental teaching needs. The resulting non-binding tabulation will be circulated to the department and provide a starting point for discussion. From the list of possible positions discussed at the meeting, each voter should list on a ballot as many positions as desired; rank these selections numerically from highest preference to lowest preference; and turn in this ranking for tabulation to the departmentï¿½s administrative associate who will maintain their confidentiality. Voters may also write in positions that were not discussed. For both the preliminary and final votes, one point will be allocated for each first- place vote; 1/2 point for each second-place vote; 1/3 point for each third-place vote; 1/4 point for each fourth-place vote; and so forth. The final list of positions submitted to the Dean will be ranked based on the number of points received from the total vote, and the final ranked list and points will be reported to the department as a whole. Ties will be reported in alphabetical order as ties. Votes for positions that are very similar may be combined or disaggregated in the preliminary and final rankings at the discretion of the Chair.
Recommendations for potential direct hires, including domestic partner accommodations and Langston Hughes Professorships, should be directed to the Department Chairperson. The Chair will then consult with the Dean and the department about the feasibility of such a hire.
Once a position has been authorized, the Chairperson will appoint a search committee to conduct preliminary evaluations of candidates. The search committee will be composed of faculty from relevant fields, faculty from the department at large, a graduate student representative, a member external to the department, and the total should be an odd number to avoid tie votes. The graduate student and external representative vote as members of the committee, but do not vote on final departmental hiring decisions. The Department Chair will designate a chairperson for the search committee.
In consultation with the Department Chair and Deanï¿½s Office, the search committee will produce a draft position description and job advertisement and present them to the department for discussion and approval and to the Dean and University administration for final approval.
Search committee members and the Department Chair will carefully follow policies and procedures of the College, Provost, Human Resources, and Equal Opportunity for faculty recruitment, with the overall goals of maximizing the diversity and quality of the applicant pool.
When the deadline for initial review arrives, the search committee will obtain a complete list of applicants and access to their complete applications. After evaluating all application files and consulting with University administration to ensure that other procedural requirements have been met, the search committee will compose a list of between nine and twelve candidates for screening interviews. The committee will make this interview list available to voting members of the department, who will be given access to all application materials so they can provide feedback to the committee on these choices.
Once the search committee has secured permission from the appropriate University offices to interview these candidates, the Department Chair will solicit a vote by eligible members of the department to approve the interview list. This vote may be conducted electronically.
After screening interviews and thoughtful deliberation, the search committee will typically select three candidates to invite to campus, and will provide at least two names as ranked alternates. The search committee chair will secure permission from the appropriate University offices to invite those candidates to campus. At this point, the search committee chair will inform all candidates that invitations for on-campus interviews have been made.
After all candidates have visited campus, the search committee will compose a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the finalists. The graduate student representative on the search committee will survey graduate students about their response to the candidates and submit this summary to include in the committee report. If the search committee can reach a consensus on ranking the finalists, it may include a suggested ranking in its report, or it can leave the finalists unranked. This report will be made available to faculty eligible for voting on hiring in advance of the meeting to discuss candidates, unless the department agrees by majority vote to waive the two-business-day rule. To help ensure confidentiality, this report will be made available in paper form and kept in the administrative associateï¿½s office.
The Department Chair will call a departmental meeting to discuss the candidates and recommend appointments to the College. The meeting will begin with the search committee chairï¿½s summary of the committee report. Student and external representatives are encouraged to participate in the initial discussion that follows the search committeeï¿½s report, but are not allowed to vote and should vacate the room during general discussion by faculty entitled to vote on personnel matters.
Voting procedure: If there are more than two finalist candidates, voting will proceed similarly to the procedure for electing a Department Chair. After the Department Chair closes discussion, each member entitled to vote on personnel decisions will receive a series of ballots with all finalist names. Faculty members must attend the meeting in person or via the procedure for virtual attendance to be eligible to vote.
Each voting member will vote for their ONE favored candidate and designate any candidate they consider ï¿½unacceptable.ï¿½
Any candidate deemed unacceptable by the majority of voters at any point will be designated unacceptable by the department.
If no candidate receives a majority on the ballot, the lowest vote recipient will be eliminated from consideration on the subsequent ballot. Voting will continue until a majority agrees on a top-ranked candidate.
In the case of a persistent tie, the search committee chair will rank the tied candidates (in this specific situation, giving the search committee chair a double vote).
The ranking that results from this vote and the list of strengths and weaknesses produced by the search committee (modified as appropriate after meeting discussion) will provide the principal basis for the departmentï¿½s recommendation for appointment to the Dean and other University administration.
After ranking is completed, the search committee chair will inform the student search representative of this outcome, so that the representative can inform other interested students, taking care to protect the confidentiality of the outcome and process. Once University administration formally approves that an offer of appointment can be made to a candidate, the search committee chair will inform in a timely manner all candidates for the position that an official offer of appointment has been made. When an offer of appointment is formally accepted by a candidate and approved by the University, the Department Chair will inform members of the department and the search committee chair will inform all applicants of the conclusion of the search.
Teaching professors are appointed to three-year, renewable positions. They are eligible for promotion after six years as described in an appendix. They are not eligible for tenure, but their appointments are envisioned as continuing provided that their performance meets or exceeds expectations and the budget permits. They have voting rights on a par with regular faculty, but may not vote on promotion and tenure cases for tenure-track faculty. Annual Evaluation of teaching professors follows procedures similar to those of tenure-track faculty as described in an appendix. They may be appointed through a competitive search, in which case the search procedure should follow that of tenure-track faculty.
The Department of History will make a concerted effort to recruit faculty from underrepresented groups by recommending direct hires and to retain faculty within our department and in other units via domestic partner accommodations. Procedures for domestic partner accommodations and other direct hires are governed by policies of the College and Provost. See, for example, http://policy.ku.edu/CLAS/domestic- partner-accommodation and http://diversity.ku.edu/langston-hughes-visiting- professors.
The direct appointment of teaching professorsï¿½and any other tenure-track faculty hires is governed by the following procedure, if it does not involve a competitive search:
Once the Dean authorizes consideration of a prospective hire to move forward, the Chairperson or designated faculty will present their credentials to the department for consideration. If a majority of a quorum of those with the right to vote on personnel matters approves, consideration of this new hire will move on to a formal interview. Such a vote can be done electronically or in a departmental meeting.
At a minimum, a formal interview will involve sharing a portfolio demonstrating the candidateï¿½s accomplishments and potential in research, teaching, and service and a public presentation to the department demonstrating one or more of these capabilities.
After completion of the interview process, the Department Chair will present a report summarizing the candidateï¿½s strengths and weaknesses to a meeting of the department. After discussion, eligible faculty will vote to approve or disapprove of the candidateï¿½s hire. This report and vote will provide the basis for the departmentï¿½s recommendation for appointment to the Dean and other University administration.
Retired colleagues who have been relieved of departmental obligations and advanced to the rank of Professor Emeritus have not relinquished many of the rights and privileges that accompany membership in the department. The department will work to ensure that they will continue to enjoy such benefits as they care to utilize. These include, but are not limited to, a departmental mailbox, mailing privileges, use of departmental stationery and other office supplies, and secretarial assistance. They are eligible for office space as departmental availability permits, and may continue to advise students and offer such courses as University rules and departmental needs allow. Their participation in departmental meetings and other departmental activities will be welcomed, albeit without a voting role. All of this entails no obligation on their part, but merely represents the departmentï¿½s desire to recognize that retirement should not diminish the fellowship they enjoy, in the conviction that Professor Emeritus is a highly esteemed academic rank which deserves respect and consideration.
The Department Chair may appoint qualified individuals as unpaid research associates or adjunct faculty, as permitted by University rules.
Faculty members who do not hold appointments in the Department of History but whose research and/or teaching is historical in nature may be appointed as courtesy members of the department.
The chairperson may make courtesy appointments based on the recommendation of departmental faculty or when approached directly by a prospective appointee. Such appointments are subject to approval by University administration.
Courtesy faculty are encouraged to participate in departmental programs, but do not hold voting rights within the department.
Appointment of lecturers, visiting professors, assistant instructors, and other paid non-tenure- track appointments (with the exception of teaching professors) will be made by the Chairperson, who will do so in consultation with Department Officers and Subject Area Caucuses, especially in the case of full-time and multi-year appointments. The Associate Chair is primarily responsible for supervising these appointments.
The Department Chair is responsible for the hiring, assignment of duties, supervision, and evaluation of all support staff assigned to the department.
A. Each faculty member with FTE in the department will serve on one and only one of the following three Regular Committees during an academic year: Undergraduate, Graduate, and Personnel. The existence of these committees will not preclude the formation of ad hoc committees by the Chair or other departmental members to meet special needs.
B. At the end of the academic year (or as circumstances require), the Personnel Committee will make recommendations to the Department Chair regarding the appointment of faculty to Regular Committees to ensure that all committees have a balanced membership appropriate to their responsibilities and in the best interests of the department. Faculty committee assignments, whenever possible, should be no less than two years and no more than four (excluding ex oficio service).
C. Joint appointments: Faculty with 0.5 or less FTE in the department will be appointed to a Regular Committee, but with the exception of the Personnel Committee, they will be expected to provide less service, such as serving for only one semester during a calendar year, given their obligations to other departments. The details of their service will be negotiated among the faculty member, the committee chair, and the Department Chair.
A. Students are entitled to be represented on all policy-making and search committees within the department at less than or equal to 20 percent of the faculty representation, and they are considered full voting members of departmental committees, unless specifically delimited by departmental bylaws. For example, student representatives are not involved in matters relating to faculty or student evaluation, and thus do not serve on the Personnel Committee. Students may serve in a representative capacity on a committee with fewer than four faculty members, but do so in an advisory capacity without a vote.
B. A graduate student shall be represented on the Graduate Committee. An undergraduate shall be represented on the Undergraduate Committee. Either graduate or undergraduate students may serve on the departmental committees other than the Personnel Committee. Students will not be represented on the Personnel Committee and shall not take part in any discussion or voting on personnel matters, including evaluation of sabbatical applications, misconduct deliberations, requests for travel/research funding, promotion and tenure committees, graduate admissions, or any matters that the Committee chair deems of a confidential nature. Student participation in changes to requirements in the undergraduate or graduate curriculum will be of an advisory nature, and without a vote in the matter. The participation of student representatives in faculty searches is discussed in the section on Faculty Appointments.
C. Selection: At the start of each academic year, the Director of Graduate Studies will initiate the process of selecting student representatives by distributing a call for nominations to all eligible students that includes this section of the bylaws. Faculty, student leaders, and interested students themselves are encouraged to nominate prospective representatives. The History Graduate Student Organization (HGSO) will annually select the graduate student representatives to the permanent committees and fill any vacancies that may occur. The Department Chair will select the undergraduate representatives to the standing committees, in consultation with the Undergraduate Director.
D. Expectations: Student representatives provide a vital service to the department. They are expected to attend all meetings of the committees to which they are assigned and to help fulfill the duties of these committees as described in their respective sections of departmental bylaws. It is important for student representatives to consult regularly with one another and with other students generally so that they can be effective representatives of the diversity of student interests and perspectives where departmental policies and activities are concerned. Student representatives will sometimes be involved in discussions of a confidential nature. It is important for students to protect this confidentiality and to ask faculty for advice on how to do so, as needed.
A. The chair will be appointed by the Department Chair and be designated as Director of Undergraduate Studies. The Director oversees the completion of the Undergraduate Committeeï¿½s tasks, delegates responsibilities to members of the Committee, and makes reports to the Department Chair and department as a whole.

The Personnel Committee consists of five members chosen from among regular faculty and teaching professors:ï¿½ three members selected from among regular faculty and teaching professors, who are elected by faculty vote for three-year terms, and two members appointed by the chair. It must include faculty from at least two different ranks or classifications. The following are ineligible: Department Chair, Associate Chair, Graduate Director, and Undergraduate Director; faculty on leave during all or part of the subsequent academic year; individuals who have served a full term within the past three years; persons not evaluated by the Personnel Committee; and individuals with an active Improvement Plan. The individual with the most years served will coordinate the duties and meetings of the Personnel Committee as its chairperson. In the case where there is no one with clear seniority on the Personnel Committee, members will choose their own chair. The chair oversees completion of Personnel Committee tasks, delegates responsibilities to members of the Committee, and makes reports to the Department Chair and department as a whole.ï¿½ At least two members of the Personnel Committee must hold the rank of full professor.
Board elections are staggered, so that each year one new member is added to the Personnel Committee. Before the end of spring semester each year, the Department Chair distributes a list of individuals eligible for election to the Personnel Committee to all members of the department eligible to vote on personnel matters. From this list, each voter should select up to five individuals for election; rank them from one (highest preference) to five (lowest preference); and turn in this ranking for tabulation to the departmentï¿½s administrative associate who will maintain their confidentiality. One point will be allocated for each first-place vote; 1/2 point for each second-place vote; 1/3 point for each third-place vote; 1/4 point for each fourth-place vote; and 1/5 point for each fifth-place vote. Subject to provisions requiring committee membership to include faculty from at least two different ranks or classifications, the Chair will appoint the individual with the highest point total. Individuals with the second- and third-highest point totals will be the second and third alternates, and so forth for ranking additional alternates. In case of a tie, the Chair will choose between the tied candidates, while making an effort to keep the committee diverse.
1. Annual Evaluations:ï¿½The Personnel Committee administers Annual Faculty Evaluation and makes recommendations to the Chairperson on matters relevant to the annual evaluation, including Post-tenure Review and the allocation of merit salary increases, as stipulated in appendices.
a. Members of the Personnel Committee who are applying for sabbatical leave are ineligible to evaluate applications. If fewer than three members remain to perform this task, the Department Chair will appoint additional temporary members for this purpose. Student representatives do not participate in these evaluations.
b. At a time stipulated by the Personnel Committee, typically three weeks before the College deadline for submission, faculty applying for sabbatical will provide a complete copy of their application to the Governance Committee for review.
c. The Personnel Committee will review these applications, provide a concise formal assessment to the applicant and the Department Chair, and informally suggest improvements to each applicant.
d. The Committee will rank these applications, as required by the College, and this ranking will be forwarded along with the final applications.
e. At a time stipulated by the Personnel Committee, typically one week before the College deadline for submission, applicants may submit a revised application to the Department Chair for endorsement, otherwise the initial submission will be forwarded to the College.
a. Untenured members of the Personnel Committee are ineligible to participate. If fewer than three members remain to perform this task, the Department Chair will appoint additional temporary members for this purpose. Student representatives do not participate in these evaluations.
b. At a time stipulated by the Department Chair and University administration, the Personnel Committee members will evaluate a dossier on research, teaching, and service for each faculty member required to undergo Progress Toward Tenure Review, following procedures described in the appendix on PTTR.
5. Committee Appointments:ï¿½The Personnel Committee appoints individuals to departmental committees as stipulated in sections above.
6. Review and oversight of departmental operations:ï¿½The Personnel Committee will review the policies and actions of the Department Chair, Department Officers, other departmental committees, and their respective chairs and members as described in the section below. When appropriate, the Personnel Committee also advises the Dean on the Department Chairï¿½s performance.
7.ï¿½ Theï¿½Personnel Committee advises the Department Chair and other members of the department on general policy and procedures within the department, both official and customary.
8. Bylaws:ï¿½Maintain bylaws that authorize and regularize important departmental policies and procedures and that are consistent with College and University policies. All proposed changes must be approved by the process stipulated in the section below on Amendments to Bylaws.
9. Policy Changes:ï¿½Monitor changes in policy of the College, Provost, Faculty Senate, University Senate, and Kansas Board of Regents. Report to the department on significant developments and institute changes to department bylaws and customary procedure as necessary.
10. Other Reports:ï¿½The Governance Committee may also be charged by the Department Chair with composing other reports and self-studies, for example, in association with External Review.
11. Grievances:ï¿½Handle formal grievance proceedings and make recommendations to the Department Chair regarding their outcome (see appendix).
12. All otherï¿½duties and responsibilities for maintaining the integrity and proper functioning of departmental governance and procedure not specified above.
Subject-area caucuses exist to advise the Chair and Department Officers on practical and strategic matters regarding staffing, course scheduling, curricular requirements, graduate reading lists, and other issues related to specific regional, thematic, and temporal areas of inquiry. There are two official caucuses: United States history and world history, and there can be any number of informal caucuses made up of two or more faculty with shared subject interests. Official caucuses should select their own faculty spokesperson and student representative each year. Faculty can be members of any number of caucuses, official or informal, in which they have a clear interest. Subject Area Caucuses are considered active if member faculty meet as a group at least once per year to discuss course scheduling, graduate student reading lists, or other matters.
A. No committee, board, or officer of the department shall attempt to determine in any way the decisions that department members make about their subjects for future research. The intent here is to limit assessments and evaluation to the products of research effort.
B. Any policy or practice promulgated by a departmental committee or its respective chair will be subject to formal review by the department when at least five voting members of the department submit a written statement to the chair of the Personnel Committee describing the need for such a review. The Personnel chairperson will present and moderate discussion of the review at a departmental meeting. When appropriate, this review and discussion will then be communicated to the Dean or other University administration for further action. When appropriate, the Personnel Committee also advises the Dean on the Department Chairï¿½s performance.
C. Faculty who are dissatisfied with the Personnel Committee's actions and decisions regarding Annual Performance Evaluations should consult the departmentï¿½s Faculty Evaluation Plan (see appendix for procedures). Issues related to any other policy or practice promulgated by the Personnel Committee or its chair will be subject to formal review by the department when at least five voting members of the department submit a written statement describing the need for such a review to the Department Chair. The Department Chair will present and moderate discussion of the review at a departmental meeting. When appropriate, this review and discussion will then be communicated to the Dean or other University administration for further action.
A. The normal teaching load of full-time faculty is four courses per year, with the exception of teaching professors and faculty with temporary or permanent Differential Allocations of Effort. Faculty membersï¿½ teaching profiles should reflect an appropriate mix of courses at different levels that satisfy the departmentï¿½s teaching responsibilities in regard to its undergraduate major, graduate program, and the KU Core Curriculum.
B. Per College policy, undergraduate courses normally must enroll at least 12 students and graduate courses at least 6 students, except as authorized by the Department Chair in order to satisfy the departmentï¿½s curricular needs.
C. Team-Taught and Non-Departmental Courses: A faculty member may count participation in a team-taught course as the equivalent of serving as the sole instructor of a course if they normally attend all sessions of the course and participate fully in the planning of the course, selecting the textbooks, constructing the syllabus and schedule, preparing and grading all examinations, and assigning final grades; or if they are designated as the primary course coordinator with principal responsibility for all aspects of the course. When appropriate, assessment of load will be expressed in fractional terms (one-third, one-half, three-fourths, etc.) to reflect an estimate of each faculty memberï¿½s participation. Normally, courses taught outside the department (without a History listing) will be taught as an overload. Exceptions will be made after consultation and agreement between individual faculty members and the Department Chair.
D. Undergraduate Advising and Mentoring: The History Department faculty is collectively responsible for ensuring that our undergraduate students receive appropriate advising. To that end, each faculty member has the following responsibilities:
Cooperating with the staff academic advisor assigned by the College to the department in providing guidance to students in their fulfillment of major, minor, and Core requirements.
Providing information about their courses so that students can make informed decisions when selecting them.
Being available for consultation with students regularly in the department and/or electronically, preferably for three regularly scheduled hours each week that school is in session.
E. Graduate Advising and Mentoring: Although a specific faculty member typically takes primary responsibility for advising a graduate student, the History Department faculty is collectively responsible for ensuring that our graduate students receive appropriate advice and mentoring. To that end,
Primary advisors of graduate students are responsible, in collaboration with the Graduate Director and the graduate program administrative associate, for tracking their adviseesï¿½ progress, and for intervening when graduate students do not make expected progress.
Members of graduate studentsï¿½ committees are responsible for providing responses to student questions and for reviewing studentsï¿½ written work in a timely manner.
Faculty members should make themselves available for consultation with graduate students regularly in the department and/or electronically, preferably for three regularly scheduled hours each week that school is in session.
Faculty members should refer graduate students encountering difficulties to the appropriate University offices.
Faculty members have a responsibility for mentoring their graduate students in professional development and career preparation.
F. Scheduling: The equitable distribution of teaching assignments is the responsibility of the Associate Chair, in consultation with the Department Chair, Directors of Graduate and Undergraduate Studies, and Subject Area Caucuses. Faculty in this section is understood to include teaching professors and lecturers with multi-year appointments. The following procedures should be utilized:
Early in fall semester, the Associate Chair, in consultation with the Undergraduate Director, will inform faculty of anticipated undergraduate teaching needs. The Associate Chair will solicit from faculty members their proposals of courses to teach in the fall and spring semesters of the following academic year, along with preferences for time, format, and size of enrollment. Faculty members are advised to consult with Subject Area Caucuses to which they belong and faculty who teach the same or related courses before submitting requests. As a part of this, faculty should also share tentative, long-term plans for rotating through courses in subsequent years.
Early in fall semester, the Graduate Director, in consultation with the Graduate Committee and Subject Area Caucuses, will solicit proposals from faculty to teach graduate classes for the following year. Such requests should include a justification for the course, including any students from outside the department who might be served by the course. When recommending a slate of graduate courses for scheduling to the Associate Chair, the Graduate Committee will consider the number of students likely to enroll and the equitable distribution of those courses across subject areas.
In consultation with the Undergraduate and Graduate Directors, the Associate Chair will review faculty preferences for teaching in light of the departmentï¿½s needs and assign courses accordingly. If a particular faculty memberï¿½s preference cannot be sustained, the Associate Chair will endeavor to identify a substitute course that answers both to the departmentï¿½s needs and the faculty memberï¿½s wishes. If faculty members have particular preferences concerning the format, size, days and times their courses are offered, they may express those preferences to the Associate Chair. However, the Associate Chair, acting for the Department Chair, has the final authority to assign teaching schedules.
If the Associate Chair, Graduate and/or Undergraduate Directors identify a teaching need that faculty are unable to fill or that might desirably be taught by an advanced graduate student as an Assistant Instructor to bolster their teaching credentials, they will consult with each other and the Department Chair concerning options for staffing those courses. If a limited-term lecturer is to be hired, the Department Chair will make the appointment.
When a current graduate student is assigned as the sole instructor for a course (i.e. Assistant Instructor), they must identify a teaching mentor from among the departmental faculty before the beginning of the semester. The teaching mentor will advise the Assistant Instructor concerning course design, syllabus preparation, assignments, and assessments throughout the semester. In addition, the teaching mentor will visit the class (in person or online), and is responsible for writing an evaluation of the Assistant Instructorï¿½s performance at the end of the semester.
Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) assignments: The Associate Chair will determine which courses should have GTAs assigned to them to assist instructors of record and inform the Graduate Director. The Graduate Director will then assign GTAs to these courses, taking into consideration the stated preference of graduate students and instructors of record when practical. GTAs and faculty members who prefer to be assigned together to particular courses may tell the Graduate Director, but the Graduate Director and the Associate Chair are empowered to make assignments in accord with the needs of the department.
If faculty or graduate students experience situational changes, such as fellowship leave or course reductions, that require changes in their future teaching schedule, they should inform the Associate Chair and Graduate Director immediately.
The Associate Chair will track advance enrollments in courses. When advance enrollments indicate that a course is unlikely to fill to the College minimum, the Associate Chair is empowered to cancel the course and reassign the faculty member to other instructional responsibilities. The Associate Chair will consult with the faculty members affected, but the Associate Chair, acting for the Department Chair, has the final say on teaching assignments. The Associate Chair may also reassign GTAs, Assistant Instructors, and limited-term lecturers based on course enrollments.
Summer Term and Winter Intercession Courses: Faculty members or advanced graduate students who would like to teach Summer Term or Winter Intercession courses should respond to the call for proposals for the next upcoming terms that is circulated by the Department Chair early in the fall semester. Proposals must demonstrate the likelihood that the course in question will meet minimum enrollment requirements. Courses that do not enroll sufficiently will be cancelled.
Study Abroad Courses: Faculty members may propose Study Abroad courses, but they are responsible for making all arrangements with Study Abroad & Global Engagement and for supplying all information in a timely manner to the Department Chair necessary for making application to the College for funding.
The department recognizes the need to maintain a complete and accurate record of each faculty memberï¿½s activities, while protecting the confidentiality of certain categories of information and limiting access to other categories of information. Therefore, the departmentï¿½s administrative associate maintains a file documenting each faculty memberï¿½s professional activities. The Confidentiality of Personnel Records is governed by Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSSR), Article VII, section 2, available at https://policy.ku.edu/governance/FSRR#art7sect2, and by the Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, Article III, section 5, available at https://policy.ku.edu/FacultyCodeKULawrence/faculty-code-of-rights#III.
Files concerning faculty members must be treated as confidential, and as such are available only to those administrators and committees who have direct responsibility for decisions concerning them. Within the History Department, the Department Chair, the Associate Chair, and the Personnel Committee may access materials in faculty files as necessary for fulfillment of their responsibilities. The departmentï¿½s administrative associates may access the files for the purpose of maintaining them.
Files connected with faculty member applications for Progress Towards Tenure Review, Promotion and Tenure, and Post-Tenure Review are kept separate from other file materials. These files may be accessed only in connection with these processes by persons authorized to participate in these processes. Subsequent to the conclusion of these processes, these files may only be accessed by authorized persons in strict accordance with University rules and Kansas Open Records laws.
A faculty member may access their own personnel file upon request. A faculty member who wants to access their file will direct this request to the Department Chair. The Department Chair will remove from the file those items, such as letters of recommendation, that were provided to the department upon a pledge of confidentiality. The remainder of the file will be provided to the faculty member in a timely manner.
If, upon examination of their own file, a faculty member determines that information is incomplete or mistaken, they may notify the Department Chair, Dean, or other University administration of the inaccuracies and ask that the file be corrected.
According to the Faculty Code, Article III, section 6, faculty members have a right to keep their own offices and files, including computers and electronic files, secure from unlawful search and seizure. Faculty members also have the responsibility of compiling, preserving, and protecting the confidentiality of records they need to fulfill their professional responsibilities. This is particularly true of files relevant to student work, Progress Toward Tenure Review, Promotion and Tenure Review, Post-Tenure Review, and annual evaluations. Accordingly, faculty members should retain the following items:
The University of Kansas protects the privacy of its studentsï¿½ records in compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and its implementing regulations. Therefore, faculty should take care to protect the privacy of students when maintaining these files. The department has secured bins for disposing of any paperwork that may be considered private, confidential, or sensitive. University Registrar policy covering the privacy of student records is available at: http://policy.ku.edu/registrar/student-record-policy.
Cases of academic misconduct by students in courses taught by the History Department will be handled according to the policies established by University Senate Rules and Regulations, Article II, section 6, available at: http://policy.ku.edu/governance/USRR#art2sect6.
Academic misconduct by a student shall include, but not be limited to, disruption of classes; threatening an instructor or fellow student in an academic setting; giving or receiving of unauthorized aid on examinations or in the preparation of notebooks, themes, reports or other assignments; knowingly misrepresenting the source of any academic work; unauthorized changing of grades; unauthorized use of University approvals or forging of signatures; falsification of research results; plagiarizing of another's work; violation of regulations or ethical codes for the treatment of human and animal subjects; or otherwise acting dishonestly in research.
Course instructors are required to report instances of academic misconduct. Therefore, faculty and other instructional staff should not handle suspected instances of academic misconduct in an informal manner, nor should they resolve them directly with the student.
When course instructors discover instances of suspected academic misconduct, they are required to act in a timely manner and should promptly compile the relevant documentation, including syllabus language relating to academic misconduct and its penalties, any course exercises to teach about plagiarism or other misconduct, assignment instructions, and all evidence of academic misconduct. If the student is an undergraduate, the course instructor will bring the evidence to the Undergraduate Director, who will initiate the process of charging the student with academic misconduct. If the student is a graduate student, the course instructor or academic advisor will bring the evidence to the Graduate Director, who will initiate the process of charging the student with academic misconduct. The course instructor may recommend a penalty, but resolution of this process will be handled by the Undergraduate or Graduate Committee.
A. A student who objects to the final grade received in a History Department course, alleging improper application of course grading criteria and procedures should first seek redress directly with the course instructor. If the student is dissatisfied with the outcome at that point, they may file a grievance through the History Departmentï¿½s Grievance Policy. If the student is dissatisfied with the outcome at that point, they may appeal to the Judicial Board of the University, per University Senate Rules and Regulations 2.3.5 and 6.4.4.
B. A student who objects to the final grade received in a History Department course alleging discrimination or other misconduct on the part of the instructor should file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, per University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.5.
A. Amendments to the bylaws must be adopted at a regular meeting of the department by majority vote. Amendments may be proposed by any member or standing committee of the department. Amendments must be distributed in writing at least one week before the meeting at which they are to be considered.
B. At the request of two voting members present at any regular departmental meeting at which amendments are being considered, these amendments must be submitted to an email ballot in which all eligible voting members of the department will have the opportunity to vote.

PolicyPurpose:ï¿½To establish the requirement that every University of Kansas course must have a syllabus on file with the University and to articulate the required and recommended information to be included within all syllabi.
Campus:ï¿½EdwardsLawrenceJuniper GardensParsonsSalinaTopekaWichitaYoderMedical Center, Kansas CityTable of Contents:ï¿½I. Required Elements
A syllabus outlines the academic relationship between instructors and students in a course. Used as the basis for communication and accountability, a syllabus conveys course expectations, organizes required information, sets the tone for the learning environment, and assists students in navigating the course. A syllabus helps document and clarify essential information, such as course goals, learning objectives, evaluation and grading standards, key dates and assignments, and expectations for student and instructor behavior.
For every credit-bearing course at the University of Kansas, the Instructor of Record (hereafter Instructor) is required to create a course syllabus that includes, at minimum, the required elements defined in this policy. The Instructor must (1) provide the syllabus (either as a hard copy or online) to every student enrolled in the course by the end of the first class session, and (2) must submit an electronic copy of the course syllabus to the appropriate campus [i.e., the KU Lawrence and reporting campuses (KULC) or KU Medical Center and reporting campuses (KUMC)] syllabus repository by the tenth day of the semester.
Course requirements [e.g., extracurricular activities, exams, quizzes, assignments, field trips (see KULC: Field Trips Policy)]
For all KULC KU Core Curriculum-certified courses, the syllabus must clearly state that status and must articulate the KU Core learning goal(s) covered in the course and certified through the University Core Curriculum Committee (UCCC)
Semester (start and end dates need to be designated if course timeframe falls outside traditional Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters)
Course instructional mode [e.g., in-person class, hybrid classroom class, hybrid online class, online class (see Instruction Mode Help Sheet)]
KUMC: School of Health Professions Attendance; School of Nursing Attendance; School of Medicine (MD) Attendance; and Graduate Studies Attendance
If a proctored or online exam is given for an online course, the due date and any cost to the student shall be noted in the course syllabus
The following required information must be referenced or directly on the syllabus [see the University Syllabus Boilerplate Language and Resource Guide for recommended language and other resources].
Explanation of instructional time expected for out-of-class student work per credit (see Credit Hour Definition policy)
KUMC: School of Health Professions Grade Policy; School of Nursing Grade Policy; School of Medicine (MD) Grade Policy; and Graduate Studies Grade Policies
In addition to the required elements defined in this policy, Instructors are encouraged to add, as appropriate, the following information to any syllabus shared with a student(s).
Instructors are encouraged to clearly communicate their expectations related to academic misconduct, plagiarism, and the use of external assistance or work (i.e., group work, non-KU tutoring, artificial intelligence)
Statement that information listed on the syllabus may be subject to change, including how the Instructor will communicate changes to students and document such modifications
Instructors are encouraged to include on the syllabus any other pertinent information that students should be informed of at the beginning of the course and to update the syllabus as needed.
Instructors are encouraged to clearly communicate and document any subsequent changes to their course syllabi.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances:ï¿½Course syllabi may be subject to additional programmatic accreditation requirements not defined in this policy.
Courses corresponding to masters' thesis, dissertation, practicum, and research hours are not subject to this policy.
Non-credit-bearing courses are not subject to this policy; however, Instructors of such courses are encouraged to use the principles of this policy to ensure students have the information needed to be successful.
Consequences:ï¿½Instructors who do not comply with this policy are subject to the disciplinary, grievance, and appeal procedures of their unit.

From the  bar at the top of the page, select Add New Policy Page. This will open a blank policy entry form to fill in.
In the Policy Owner field, select your unit from the drop-down list. For the Contact field, enter the contact information for your unit, NOT an individual's name and personal contact information.

By following the recommended URL naming convention, we can ensure that the policy owner and subject for each document is easily identifiable.
You will always use the same Policy Owner prefix for your policies, and the only thing you will need to customize is what you will use for the policy title. We recommend using the most concise version of the policy name possible, excluding words such as ‘of, ’ ‘the,’ ‘a,’ etc., and separating words with dashes.

By following the recommended URL naming convention, we can ensure that the policy owner and subject for each document is easily identifiable.
You will always use the same Policy Owner prefix for your policies, and the only thing you will need to customize is what you will use for the policy title. We recommend using the most concise version of the policy name possible, excluding words such as ‘of, ’ ‘the,’ ‘a,’ etc., and separating words with dashes.

The discrimination complaint resolution process is intended to provide effective resolution for complaints of discrimination on the basis of race (including racial harassment), religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual harassment, and sexual violence), disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran , sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity and gender expression. Affected persons, including students, faculty, staff, community members or others involved in university events or programs, may utilize the process to address complaints of discrimination related to University hiring and selection procedures, employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions, or University educational programs and activities.
Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a prohibited discriminatory practice at the University may contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. Individuals who may use this procedure include, but are not limited to: individuals applying for enrollment or employment with the university; students; faculty, including those with visiting appointments; teaching or research assistants; postdoctoral research associates and fellows; university support staff and other unclassified employees; university administrators; and other persons receiving university services or participating in university programs. A person in the university community may ask that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX initiate an investigation of a specific matter. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when it has reason to believe that discriminatory or retaliatory action is occurring.
The process for resolving discrimination complaints may include some or all of the following actions: informal inquiry and discussion, mediation (except in cases of sexual harassment), disciplinary action, or other appropriate action. If the subject matter or issue of the complaint does not fall within the jurisdiction of this policy, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will advise the complainant of other available procedures.
In many cases, individuals will take appropriate corrective action when they are made aware of how their actions or behaviors are being perceived. If the complainant is comfortable doing so, the complainant may bring the concerns to the attention of the person responsible for the behavior or action. Complainants who choose not to address the discrimination directly on their own or through other informal processes may seek the assistance of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. Complainants are encouraged to file their complaints within one hundred eighty (180) days of the most recent occurrence of the alleged discrimination.
Unit heads and others who serve in leadership roles in the university are responsible for nondiscrimination in their employment and academic environments. With the exceptions specified below, all employees at the University of Kansas are required to contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX at 785-864-6414 or civilrights@ku.edu to report incidents of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, of which they know or have reason to believe may have occurred.
For example, if a student shares information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, with a faculty or staff member, the faculty or staff member must report the information to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also initiate an investigation when appropriate and in the interests of the University to do so.
Health care providers and pastoral and professional counselors who receive information about discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, while acting in their role as a health care provider or pastoral or professional counselor are not required to report such information to Office of Civil Rights & Title IX; and
The CARE Coordinator, who is the employee designated to provide information about reporting options on a confidential basis.
The University Ombuds and Faculty Ombuds, who are employees designated to provide confidential assistance to persons seeking information about University policies and processes.
Employees who are exempt from reporting to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX still have an obligation to exercise reasonable care to protect a foreseeable victim from danger and to make reports mandated by law.  In addition, exempt employees shall encourage individuals to report discrimination or sexual harassment, including sexual violence, to contact Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and the police.
Any individual who believes that they have been the subject of discrimination or retaliation, or a Dean, Director, Chairperson or other supervisor or administrator who has reason to believe that discrimination or retaliation may have occurred, should contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to initiate the filing of a complaint. A complaint should include the following, to the extent known and available:
Nature of the alleged violation(s); i.e. race, sex, disability discrimination or retaliation, etc.;
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide the complainant with an acknowledgement of receipt within seven (7) working days and will include in that acknowledgement the web address where the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process can be found.
Upon receiving a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall conduct an initial evaluation of the merits of the complaint and determine the appropriate investigatory action required. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will contact the dean, director, administrator, supervisor, or chairperson responsible for the unit to inform them of the filing of the complaint. When necessary, appropriate administrator(s) or faculty member(s) may be designated by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Vice Provost, Dean, Director, or Chairperson, by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or by the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to participate in the evaluation of the complaint and to facilitate necessary action.
A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy and articulates sufficient facts, which if determined to be accurate, would support a finding that the University's discrimination policies have been violated. Investigators assigned to conduct an investigation will be impartial. In conducting investigations into violations of the University’s Policies, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will use a preponderance of the evidence standard in making factual determinations. A preponderance of the evidence standard means the fact in issue is more probably true than not.
The University will strive to complete discrimination complaint investigations, including issuance of a report of findings to the complainant and respondent, in as timely and efficient a manner as possible within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complaint. However, this timeframe may be extended based on factors such as, but not limited to, schedule and availability of witnesses, holidays or semester breaks including summer break, and complexity of the complaint. If an investigation cannot be completed within sixty (60) days of receipt of the complaint, then the investigator(s) will notify the complainant and respondent of that fact and provide a timeframe for completing the investigation.
Notice to Respondent. The respondent will be provided with a statement of the complaint in writing, and the complainant will be provided a copy of this notification. The respondent will be provided an opportunity to meet with the investigator(s) investigating the complaint and to respond to the allegation. Respondents may respond in person or in writing within a reasonable time to be determined by the investigators. If a respondent chooses not to participate or refuses to answer a complaint, the nonparticipation will not prevent the investigation from proceeding and could result in a finding based solely on the information provided by the complainant.
Notice regarding Retaliation. All parties to a complaint (complainant, respondent, witnesses, and appropriate administrators or supervisors) will be informed that retaliation by an individual or an individual's associates against any person who files a complaint or any person who participates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation are subject to disciplinary action.
Contact with Complainant. If the investigator did not speak with the complainant at the time that the complaint was received by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, then the investigator will meet or speak with the complainant at the start of the investigation and throughout the investigation as appropriate.
Representation. In any meeting with the investigators, the parties to the complaint (complainant and the respondent) may bring a representative to the meeting. If the representative is an attorney, the party must notify the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing at least three (3) working days before the meeting date.
Information relevant to Investigation. The parties to a complaint (complainant and respondent) will be informed that they have the opportunity to identify witnesses, present witness statements, and any other evidence they believe relevant to resolution of the complaint. The investigator(s) will interview other persons whom, at the investigator(s)' discretion determines to be necessary to gather relevant information. The investigator will review any written materials, e-mails or other media that, at the investigator's discretion may provide relevant information regarding the complaint.
Findings of Investigation. The investigator(s) will provide a written summary of their findings to the respondent and the complainant within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the investigation. In addition, the investigator(s) will provide a written report of the investigation findings and recommendations to the appropriate administrators within the University who will determine the appropriate action to be taken in light of the investigation findings and recommendations. The administrators will have twenty working days from receipt of the investigation findings and recommendations to determine, in consultation with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, an appropriate resolution(s). Upon making their decision, the administrator(s) will provide written notification of their decision to both the respondent and complainant.
Respondent, Finding of Discrimination or Retaliation with Imposition of Discipline. If formal disciplinary action is imposed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation, then a respondent may seek as follows:
Faculty member or an unclassified academic staff member. The affected employee may request a hearing before the University Judicial Board or the Faculty Rights Board, as determined by the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.2 and the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff.)
Student. The student may request a hearing in accordance with the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities. If the student does not request a hearing, the Vice Provost for Student Affairs will determine the sanction. (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.9).
Graduate Teaching Assistant. A graduate teaching assistant may request a review in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the University of Kansas, the Kansas Board of Regents and the Kansas Association of Public Employees (representing graduate teaching assistants at the University of Kansas, Lawrence). (See University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.16).
Other Student Employees, including Graduate Research Assistants and Graduate Assistants. Other student employees, including graduate research assistants and graduate assistants, may request that a supervisor's decision be reviewed by the next-level administrator and/or may contact Human Resource Management for assistance at hrdept@ku.edu or 785-864-4946.
Unclassified Professional Staff Employee. An unclassified professional staff member may seek review of disciplinary actions as specified by University policy, http://policy.ku.edu/hr/Disciplinary_Action_Policy_for_Staff.
University Support Staff Employee. A University Support Staff employee who is not serving an initial probationary period and has been suspended, demoted, or dismissed as a result of a finding of violation of the University's policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation may appeal the sanction to the University Disciplinary Action Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in University policy, http://policy.ku.edu/provost/disciplinary-action-hearing-board-support-staff.
The University may not proceed with a complaint investigation under a variety of circumstances, for instance:
A complainant, even after contact and follow up with an investigator, fails to describe in sufficient detail the conduct that is the basis of the complaint;
If it is determined that the University will not proceed with investigation of a complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will notify the complainant (if not anonymous) in writing explaining the reasons why the complaint is not being investigated. The notification letter will include a statement notifying the complainant that the complainant may appeal the determination not to proceed with an investigation of the complaint to the Vice Chancellor and Provost with ten (10) working days of the notice. The request for an appeal must be a signed, written document articulating why the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation was in error. The Vice Chancellor and Provost will respond to the request for appeal within twenty (20) working days of receipt of the appeal. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is upheld, then that decision will constitute final agency action and there is no further appeal within the University. If the decision to administratively close the complaint without an investigation is overturned, the complaint will be sent back to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX for investigation in accordance with this procedure.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will make every reasonable attempt to adhere to the time limits set forth in these procedures. However, it is recognized that circumstances may necessitate an extension of time. Therefore, the Executive Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may extend the time limits set forth in these procedures.
Retaliation against persons who file discrimination complaints or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint, whether by an individual directly involved or by associates of the individual involved, is a violation of law and University policy. Complainants who utilize these procedures or persons who participate in an investigation of a complaint should not be subjected to retaliation. Retaliation may take the form of unwanted personal contact from the respondent or giving additional assignments that are not assigned to others in similar situations, poor grades or unreasonable course assignments. Phone calls, e-mail or other attempts to discuss the complaint may be perceived as retaliation under certain circumstances. Disciplinary action, harassment, unsupported evaluations, or other adverse changes in the conditions of employment or the educational environment may also constitute retaliation. Retaliation will not be tolerated and could result in suspension, reassignment, salary reduction, termination, expulsion or other disciplinary action.
The University takes all discrimination complaints seriously. However, knowingly filing a false complaint is considered serious misconduct and is also subject to sanction. An individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints that harass colleagues and/or abuse the complaint resolution process may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time. Such cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of University Senate Rules and Regulations section 6.5.4, Abuse of Grievance Process.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will handle all discrimination and harassment complaints discreetly but cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity because the University has an obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment and to maintain a safe environment, free from harassment and discrimination. Because of its obligations under the law, KU will not be able to honor all requests for confidentiality or all requests that a complaint not be pursued.
However, complainants, respondents, witnesses, and any other parties involved in a complaint of discrimination shall refrain from disclosing information about a complaint of discrimination to anyone who does not have a legitimate, business need or right to know. Such disclosures are inappropriate and unprofessional and may result in disciplinary action. The foregoing does not preclude either party from seeking the advice or counsel of a supervisor, counselor, attorney, or other person in a similar role.
Employees may file employment discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. Students may file discrimination complaints through the Office of Civil Rights in the U. S. Department of Education or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX can provide information about deadlines and filing procedures for the state and federal agencies.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances: In accordance with the Abuse of the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process section above and the provisions of the University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.5.4, an individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time.
Consequences: Members of the University community who are found to have violated the University Nondiscrimination Policy are subject to disciplinary actions appropriate to their status as faculty, staff, or student employees or as students.

ProcedurePurpose: To articulate the University’s procedures for resolving complaints of sexual harassment.
III. Receipt of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX Investigate Report By Administrative Office
These hearing procedures apply to the resolution of Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment under the University’s Sexual Harassment Policy after such Formal Complaints have been investigated by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX pursuant to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX' Title IX Resolution Process.
A. Administrative Office refers to the office within the University responsible for administering these procedures. The Administrative Office varies depending on the status of the Respondent (i.e., administrator; faculty; student; or staff/third party) as specified herein.
B. Administrative Officer refers to an individual designated by the Administrative Office to coordinate the logistics of these procedures in collaboration with the Hearing Chair.
C. Advisor refers to an individual of a party’s choosing who provides emotional support to a party; assists the party in preparing for the hearing; attends pre-hearing meetings with the party; and who conducts questioning on behalf of a party at the hearing. An advisor may, but does not have to be, an attorney. The role of the Advisor is further explained herein.
D. Complainant refers to the individual who is alleged to be the victim of the alleged Sexual Harassment stated in the Formal Complaint.
E. Formal Complaint refers to a Formal Complaint as defined in the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX’s Title IX Resolution Process.
F. Hearing Chair refers to a single individual who oversees and administers the prehearing procedures, hearing, deliberation, and determination. The Hearing Chair, together with the Hearing Panel, resolves disputed facts under a preponderance of the evidence standard and determines whether those facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint.
G. Hearing Panel refers to two individuals who, together with the Hearing Chair, receive evidence at the hearing, resolve disputed facts under a preponderance of the evidence standard, and determine whether those facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint.
H. Relevant Evidence is that evidence which has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and where the fact is of consequence in determining the allegations of Sexual Harassment at issue in a Formal Complaint. Some evidence, such as certain evidence of a Complainant’s sexual history, is categorically excluded as irrelevant, as further specified herein.
I. Respondent refers to the individual who is alleged to have perpetrated the alleged Sexual Harassment stated in the Formal Complaint.
J. Sexual Harassment refers to Sexual Harassment as defined in the University’s Sexual Harassment Policy, including Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking as those terms are defined in the University’s Sexual Harassment Policy.
III. Receipt of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX Investigative Report By Administrative Office
At the conclusion of its Title IX Resolution Process, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will transmit a copy of its final investigation report, together with all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint, to the Administrative Office. The Administrative Office responsible for administering these procedures varies based on the status of the Respondent. The relevant offices are:
Upon receipt of the investigation report and evidence, the Administrative Office will appoint an Administrative Officer who shall thereafter be responsible for coordinating the selection of a Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, assisting the Hearing Chair in arranging the pre-hearing conference and hearing, and ensuring an appropriate record of the proceedings is made.
The University will maintain a pool of up to six suitably qualified individuals to serve as Hearing Chairs under these procedures. The pool shall include individuals reflective of the diversity of the University community.
Such individuals shall have experience in the conduct of administrative proceedings, the presentation of evidence, ruling on the admissibility of evidence, administering deliberations, and drafting written decisions. All Hearing Chairs shall also receive training from the University on the University’s definition of Sexual Harassment; the scope of the University’s education programs and activities; how to conduct the various procedures and hearing specified herein; how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias; relevance of questions and evidence, including when questions and evidence about a Complainant’s sexual history are not relevant; and training on any audio or video technology that may be used to effectuate the pre-hearing conference or hearing.
The Administrative Officer shall select a member of the pool to serve as Hearing Chair giving due regard to factors such as the individual’s availability to promptly conduct a hearing; the individual’s general familiarity with the particular aspect of the University’s operations from which the Formal Complaint arose; potential conflicts of interest that may exist based on the identity of the parties or subject matter involved; and the relative equal distribution of cases across the pool.
After the Administrative Officer selects the Hearing Chair, the Administrative Officer will provide the parties with written notice of the Hearing Chair’s selection. Such notice shall advise the parties that they have three days from receipt of the notice to advise the Administrative Officer of any objection to the selected Hearing Chair based on a claimed conflict of interest or bias.
If any party claims a conflict of interest or bias on the part of the selected Hearing Chair, the Administrative Officer shall determine whether, in fact, such a conflict of interest or bias exists. If the Administrative Officer determines a conflict of interest or bias exists, the Administrative Officer shall select a new Hearing Chair and provide the parties with written notice as specified in this section. If the Administrative Officer determines that a conflict of interest or bias does not exist, the Administrative Officer shall notify the parties in writing, and the matter will proceed with the identified Hearing Chair.
After the selection of the Hearing Chair, and prior to the selection of a Hearing Panel, the Hearing Chair, in consultation with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and the Administrative Officer, will review the final investigation report, together with all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint, and determine whether the Formal Complaint should be dismissed for any one or more of the following grounds:
The Complainant has provided the Title IX Coordinator written notice that the Complainant wishes to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed);
Specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint, or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed).
In the event the Hearing Chair determines that a Formal Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to this section, the Hearing Chair will provide written notice of dismissal to the parties and advise them of their right to appeal as specified herein. The Hearing Chair may refer the dismissed allegations for resolution by other University offices, as appropriate.
If the Formal Complaint is not dismissed, the Administrative Officer shall select two individuals to serve as the Hearing Panel. At least one of the two individuals selected must share the same status as the Respondent (i.e., faculty, student, or staff). Such individuals shall be selected giving due regard to factors such as the individual’s availability to promptly participate in a hearing; the individual’s general familiarity with the particular aspect of the University’s operations from which the Formal Complaint arose; potential conflicts of interest that may exist based on the identity of the parties or subject matter involved; and the relative equal distribution of cases across the pool.
Such individuals shall be drawn from a pool of suitably qualified individuals. The pool shall include students, faculty, and staff. Student members shall be appointed by the Vice Provost for Student Affairs in consultation with the Student Senate President. Faculty members shall be appointed by the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor in consultation with the Faculty Senate President. Staff members shall be appointed by the Vice Provost for Operations in consultation with the Staff Senate President.
The pool shall include individuals reflective of the diversity of the University community, including individuals from various schools and departments. Such individuals shall receive training from the University on the University’s definition of Sexual Harassment; the scope of the University’s education programs and activities; the individual’s role at the hearing as specified herein; how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias; relevance of questions and evidence, including when questions and evidence about a Complainant’s sexual history are not relevant; and training on any audio or video technology that may be used to effectuate the pre-hearing conference or hearing.
After the Administrative Officer selects the Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer will provide the parties with written notice of the Hearing Panel’s selection. Such notice shall advise the parties that the parties have three days from receipt of the notice to advise the Administrative Officer of any objection a party may have based on a claimed conflict of interest or bias.
If any party claims a conflict of interest or bias on the part of a member of the selected Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer shall determine whether, in fact, such a conflict of interest or bias exists. If the Administrative Officer determines a conflict of interest or bias exists, the Administrative Officer shall select a new member of the Hearing Panel and provide the parties with written notice as specified in this section. If the Administrative Officer determines that a conflict of interest or bias does not exist, the Administrative Officer shall notify the parties, in writing, and the matter will proceed with the identified Hearing Panel.
After the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel are selected, the Administrative Officer will send written notice to the parties notifying them of the deadline for the parties to submit any written response to the investigation report; a date for the pre-hearing conference; and a date and time for the hearing (to including an anticipated length in hours). Neither the pre-hearing conference, nor the hearing itself, may be held any earlier than fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of transmittal of the written notice specified in this section.
To the extent the party disagrees with the investigation report, any argument or commentary regarding such disagreement;
Any evidence that a party did not have a reasonable opportunity to provide during the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigation or that the party believes was improperly excluded by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX;
Any argument that evidence should be categorically excluded from consideration at the hearing based on privilege, relevancy, the prohibition on the use of sexual history specified herein, or for any other reason;
A list of any witnesses that the party contends should be called to attend the hearing pursuant to an attendance notice issued by the Administrative Officer;
A list of any witnesses that the party intends to bring to the hearing without an attendance notice issued by the Hearing Chair;
Any request that the parties be separated physically during the pre-hearing conference and/or hearing;
Any other accommodations that the party seeks with respect to the prehearing conference and/or hearing;
The name and contact information of the Advisor who will accompany the party at the pre-hearing conference and hearing;
If the party does not have an Advisor who will accompany the party at the hearing, a request that the University provide an Advisor for purposes of assisting the party in preparing for the hearing and conducting questioning at the hearing.
Argument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint are supported by a preponderance of the evidence; and
Argument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint constitute Sexual Harassment.
Prior to the hearing, the Hearing Chair will conduct a pre-hearing conference with the parties and their Advisors. By default, the pre-hearing conference will be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology. However, upon request of either party, or in the Hearing Chair’s discretion, the pre-hearing conference may take the form of separate, sequential meetings between the Hearing Chair and each party, whether conducted virtually or in-person.
During the pre-hearing conference, the Hearing Chair will discuss the hearing procedures with the parties; address matters raised in the parties’ written responses to the investigation report, as the Hearing Chair deems appropriate; discuss whether any stipulations may be made to expedite the hearing; discuss the witnesses the parties have requested be served with notices of attendance and/or witnesses the parties plan to bring to the hearing without a notice of attendance; and resolve any other matters that the Hearing Chair determines, in the Hearing Chair’s discretion, should be resolved before the hearing.
After the pre-hearing conference, the Administrative Officer will transmit notices of attendance to any University employee (i.e. administrator, faculty, or staff) or student whose attendance is requested at the hearing as a witness. The notice will request the subject to appear at the hearing at the specified date and time and advise the subject to contact the Administrative Officer immediately if there is a scheduling conflict.
The subject of an attendance notice should notify any manager, faculty member, coach, or other supervisor, as necessary, if attendance at the hearing will conflict with job duties, classes, or other obligations. All such managers, faculty members, coaches, and other supervisors will be encouraged to excuse the subject of the obligation, or provide some other accommodation, so that the subject may attend the hearing as specified in the notice.
The University has no control over the schedule or availability of any witness who is not an employee or a student, and a notice of attendance will not be issued to any  such third-party individual. The University also does not have the authority to compel the attendance and testimony of student witnesses.
Prior to commencement of the hearing, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will review the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX's final investigation report and all evidence directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. This review of materials is provisional and intended to provide background and orientation to the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel in preparing for the hearing. The Hearing Chair must eventually exclude from consideration in deliberation any evidence developed during the investigation that is deemed inadmissible at the hearing.
The purpose of the hearing is for the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel to receive relevant testimonial and non-testimony evidence; to resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence standard; and to determine whether the facts so found substantiate one or more of the allegations in the Formal Complaint as a violation of the Sexual Harassment Policy. The hearing will operate from a presumption that the Respondent is not responsible for the alleged misconduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made final.
The hearing is not a formal judicial proceeding and strict rules of evidence do not apply except as otherwise set forth in these procedures and as requried by law.
The Administrative Officer will assist the Hearing Chair in arranging the logistics of the hearing including, but not limited to, securing a suitable space on campus, if the hearing is to be held in person or to secure access to appropriate technology if the hearing is to be held virtually. The Administrative Officer will also ensure that the hearing (but not deliberation) is audio or video recorded.
The hearing will be conducted live, with simultaneous and contemporaneous participation by the parties and their Advisors. By default, the hearing will be conducted with the Hearing Chair, Hearing Panel, the parties, the Advisors, witnesses, and other necessary University personnel together in the same physical location. However, upon request of either party, the parties will be separated into different rooms with technology enabling the parties to participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by video and audio.
In the Hearing Chair’s discretion, the hearing may be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology.
The Hearing Chair oversees the hearing process, rules on questions of relevance and admissibility, resolves all procedural disputes, questions parties and witnesses, and deliberates and votes with the Hearing Panel to determine responsibility for the allegations in the Formal Complaint at the conclusion of the hearing process. The Hearing Chair is responsible for maintaining decorum and professionalism in the hearing. The Hearing Chair has discretion to interpret and apply these procedures in any manner that is not clearly unreasonable and is consistent with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulation.
The Hearing Panel reviews the investigation report and hearing files in advance of the hearing, questions parties and witnesses when invited to do so by the Hearing Chair, and deliberates and votes with the Hearing Chair to determine responsibility for the allegations in the Formal Complaint at the conclusion of the hearing process.
The hearing is closed to all persons except the parties, their Advisors, the investigator, the Hearing Chair, the Hearing Panel, the Administrative Officer, and other necessary University personnel as determined by the Hearing Chair. With the exception of the investigator and the parties, witnesses will be sequestered until such time as their testimony is complete.
Immediately prior to convening the hearing, the Hearing Chair will ensure that an audio or video recording of the hearing is being made by the Administrative Officer and that the hearing room is cleared of all individuals who are not permitted to be present during the hearing. The Hearing Chair will then  convene the hearing and clearly state for the record the date, time, and location of the hearing; the names of the Complainant and Respondent; the parties present at the hearing; any accommodations that have been provided at the request of a party or in the  University’s discretion; whether all or a portion of the hearing is being conducted virtually; and any other introductory matters that the Hearing Chair deems appropriate.
After convening the hearing, the Hearing Chair will call the investigator to give an overview of the investigation process. Thereafter, the investigator will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from each party’s Advisor commencing first with questioning  from the Advisor for the Complainant followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent. The investigator will not provide testimony about credibility or whether the investigator believes that the facts support a finding that a policy violation has or has not occurred.
After questioning of the investigator is complete, the Hearing Chair will invite the Complainant to provide a statement regarding the events in question and identify and comment on any non-testimonial evidence the Complainant believes is relevant. After the Complainant has made a statement, or waived  the right to make a statement, the Complainant will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent.
After questioning of the Complainant is complete, the Hearing Chair will invite the Respondent to provide a statement to the Hearing Chair regarding the events in question and to identify and comment on any non-testimonial evidence the Respondent believes is relevant. After the Respondent has made a statement, or waived the right to make a statement, the Respondent will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Complainant.
After questioning of the parties is complete, witnesses will be called to testify in the order determined by the Hearing Chair. Unlike the parties, witnesses will not be invited to make a statement but, instead, will be subject to questioning from the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel, followed by questioning from each party’s Advisor commencing first with questioning from the Advisor for the Complainant followed by questioning from the Advisor for the Respondent.
After the questioning of the parties and witnesses is complete, the Hearing Chair will identify any portion of the evidence developed during the investigation that the Hearing Chair has determined should be excluded from the hearing record based on rulings made at the pre-hearing conference, during the hearing itself, or for any other reason. The Hearing Chair will then provide the parties a final opportunity to raise any additional objections to inclusion of any other portions of the investigation record into evidence and  resolve any such objections. All evidence from the investigation and hearing not specifically excluded by the Hearing Chair shall be deemed admitted into the hearing record and may be considered by the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel as part of the deliberation.
After the Hearing Chair has ruled on the exclusion of any evidence developed during the investigation, the Hearing Chair will invite the Complainant to make a closing argument. After the Complainant has made a closing argument, or waived the right to make a closing argument, the Hearing Chair will invite the Respondent to make a closing argument.
After closing arguments are complete, the Hearing Chair will conclude the hearing. Thereafter, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will enter into deliberation, which shall be closed to all other persons with the exception of the University’s legal counsel, whom the Hearing Chair may invite for the purpose of providing advice to the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel.
During the hearing, the parties and their Advisors shall have access to the investigation report and a copy of all evidence developed by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigation directly related to the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. Such evidence may be utilized in the questioning of witnesses where relevant. Non-testimonial evidence utilized during the hearing shall be marked and referred to in such a manner as to make it clearly identifiable by audio (i.e., such as sequential marking of “exhibits”).
Throughout the hearing, the Hearing Chair will independently and contemporaneously screen all questions for relevance and resolve any contemporaneous evidentiary objections raised by the parties. If the Hearing Chair does not exclude a question, it is presumed the Hearing Chair has deemed the question relevant and admissible. The Hearing Chair may exclude evidence that is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative.
The Hearing Chair will have discretion to set the overall length of the hearing and may set time limits for statements of the parties, questioning of parties and witnesses, and closing arguments. A hearing will not exceed seven hours in length absent extraordinary circumstances. Once a hearing is commenced, it will be continued to another day only for good cause as determined by the Hearing Chair. The Hearing Chair has discretion to schedule breaks during the hearing.
In accordance with University Senate Code Article XII, during the pre-hearing conference and hearing, the Complainant and Respondent have the right to be represented by an Advisor or Counsel of their choice at their own cost and expense.
In the event a party is not able to secure an Advisor or Counsel to attend the hearing and conduct cross-examination of witnesses on behalf of that party, the University will provide the party an Advisor, without fee or charge, to conduct questioning on behalf of witnesses on behalf of the party at the hearing. The University will have sole discretion to select the Advisor it provides, but may consider input from the party. The Advisor the University provides may be, but is not required to be, an attorney.
The University is not required to provide a party with an Advisor in any circumstance except where the party does not have an Advisor present at the hearing. Except for conducting the questioning of witnesses during the hearing, an Advisor assigned by the University will play a passive role and is not permitted to communicate on behalf of a party, insist that communication flow through the Advisor, or communicate with the University about the matter. University-appointed Advisors are not permitted to make objections, present arguments, or engage in any other active role apart from questioning of witnesses.
In addition to an advisor of their choice, a party may be accompanied to the hearing by up to two support persons of their choice, provided a support person cannot be a witness. The support persons play a passive role and are not permitted to communicate on behalf of a party, insist that communication flow through the support person, or communicate with the University about the matter. Support persons are not permitted to make objections, present arguments, or engage in any active role.
During the hearing, evidence regarding a Complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Complainant who affirmatively uses information otherwise considered irrelevant by this section may be deemed to have waived the protections of this section.
During the hearing, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel are not permitted to access, consider, disclose, permit questioning concerning, or otherwise use the following types of records unless the party holding the privilege has provided prior, written consent:
A party’s records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professional or paraprofessional’s capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party; or
Information or records protected from disclosure by any other legally recognized privilege, such as the attorney client privilege.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party who affirmatively uses information otherwise protected by this section may be deemed to have waived the protections of this section.
All parties, Advisors, and other persons present at a hearing are required to act professionally, maintain decorum, and abide by the policy, these procedures, and any other rules specified by the Hearing Chair. The requirements of professionalism and decorum apply to all aspects of the hearing, including the manner in which questions are posed to parties and witnesses. Any party, Advisor, or other person who materially disrupts the proceeding or violates applicable policies, procedures, and rules, may be barred from further participation and/or have their participation limited, as the case may be, by the Hearing Chair.
Wherever these procedures contemplate questioning of a party or witnesses, the Hearing Chair has discretion to permit more than one round of questioning. In addition to ruling on questions of relevancy, the Hearing Chair may limit cumulative and redundant questioning.
After the hearing is complete, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will privately deliberate over the matter. The deliberation will not be audio or video recorded. The deliberation will include an objective evaluation of all relevant evidence collected during the investigation, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, together with testimonial and non-testimonial evidence received at the hearing. While deliberating, the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will ensure that any credibility determinations made are not based on a person’s status as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness. The Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will take care to exclude from consideration any evidence that was ruled inadmissible at the pre-hearing conference, during the hearing, or by other operation of these procedures, or as required by law.
In deciding what the facts are, the Hearing Panel will decide what testimony and evidence it believes and what testimony and evidence it does not believe. The Hearing Panel may believe all of what a witness said, or only part of it, or none of it.
In deciding what testimony to believe, the Hearing Panel should consider the opportunity the witness had to have seen or heard the things testified about, the witness' memory, any motives that witness may have for testifying a certain way, the manner of the witness while testifying, whether that witness said something different at an earlier time, the general reasonableness of the testimony, and the extent to which the testimony is consistent with any other evidence that is believed.
In deciding whether or not to believe a witness, the Hearing Panel should consider that people sometimes hear or see things differently and sometimes forget things and therefore should consider whether a contradiction is an innocent misrecollection or lapse of memory or an intentional falsehood, and that may depend on whether it has to do with an important fact or only a small detail.
The Hearing Panel shall draw no inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a party’s or witness’s absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions. However, the hearing panel may consider in determining the weight of the evidence the extent to which the witness’ testimony or other evidence has been subject to cross-examination, particularly on matters that are material to the outcome of the case.
The Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel will resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., “more likely than not”) standard and reach a determination regarding whether the facts that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence substantiate one or more of the allegations of Sexual Harassment in the Formal Complaint. In the deliberation, the Hearing Chair and each member of the Hearing Panel have one vote. Abstentions are not permitted. A majority vote controls.
In the event the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel determine that the Respondent is responsible for violating the Sexual Harassment Policy the Hearing Chair will, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with the appropriate administrator with disciplinary authority over the Respondent and such administrator will determine any discipline to be imposed. The Hearing Chair will also, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with the Title IX Coordinator who will determine whether and to what extent ongoing support measures or other remedies will be provided to the Complainant.
After reaching a determination and consulting with the appropriate University administrator and Title IX Coordinator, the Hearing Chair will prepare a written decision that will include:
Identification of the allegations potentially constituting Sexual Harassment made in the Formal Complaint;
A description of the procedural steps taken by the University upon receipt of the Formal Complaint, through issuance of the written decision, including notification to the parties, interviews with the parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather non-testimonial evidence, and the date, location, and people who were present at or presented testimony at the hearing;
Articulate findings of fact, made under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that support the determination;
A statement of, and rationale for, each allegation that constitutes a separate potential incident of Sexual Harassment, including a determination regarding responsibility for each separate potential incident;
The discipline determined by the appropriate University administrator and any ongoing support measures or other remedies as determined by the Title IX Coordinator; and
The written determination will be signed by the Hearing Chair on behalf of the Hearing Chair and Hearing Panel. The written determination will then be transmitted by the Administrative Officer to the parties, the Administrative Officer, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, and other University officials, as appropriate. Transmittal of the written determination to the parties concludes the hearing process, subject to any right of appeal. In a typical case, the written determination will be transmitted within fourteen (14) days of completion of the hearing, but this time period may vary depending on a range of factors including the complexity of the allegations at issue.
Either party may appeal the dismissal of a Formal Complaint or written determination, as the case may be, to an appeals panel of the University Judicial Board. Appeal is permitted one or more of the following grounds, in addition to those grounds specified in University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.7.3.:
There is new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination or dismissal was made, that could have affected the outcome;
The Title IX Coordinator, investigator, Hearing Chair, or Hearing Panel, as the case may be, had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or against the individual Complainant or Respondent, that affected the outcome;
The party was deprived of a right guaranteed by some other University policy or standard and the deprivation of that right affected the outcome.
A party must file an appeal within fourteen (14) days of the date they receive notice of dismissal or written determination appealed from. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Chair of the University Judicial Board. If an appeal is untimely or fails to invoke one or more of the permitted grounds for appeal, it will be dismissed.
If a timely appeal is filed invoking one or more of the permitted grounds, it shall be processed and heard in the manner specified in USRR Article VI, Section 7.
The determination of a Formal Complaint becomes final when the time for appeal has passed with no party filing an appeal or, if any appeal is filed, at the point when the University has resolved all appeals, either by dismissal or by transmittal of a written decision from the appeals panel. No further review or appeal is permitted beyond appeal to the University Judicial Board as specified herein.
The Title IX Coordinator, Administrative Officer, Hearing Chair, Hearing Panel, and appeals panel will be free of any conflicts of interest or bias. Any party who believes one or more of these individuals has a material conflict of interest or material bias must raise the concern promptly so that the University may evaluate the concern and find a substitute, if appropriate. The failure of a party to timely raise a concern of a conflict of interest or bias may result in a waiver of the issue.
Parties are expected to raise any objections, concerns, or complaints about the processes specified herein in a prompt and timely manner so that the University may evaluate the matter and address it, if appropriate. The failure of a party to timely raise an objection, concern, or complaint may result in a waiver of the issue.
The recording of the hearing will be made only by the University and is considered property of the University, subject to any right of access that a party may have under this policy, FERPA, and other applicable federal, state, or local laws. Only the University is permitted to make a recording of the hearing. The surreptitious recording of any meeting, interview, hearing, or other interaction contemplated by these procedures is prohibited. Any party who wishes to transcribe a hearing by use of a transcriptionist must seek preapproval from the  Administrative Officer.
It is a violation of these procedures for any person to provide testimony or other evidence that the person knows to be false or in bad faith.
The University retains discretion to interpret and apply these procedures in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable, even if the University’s interpretation or application differs from the interpretation of the parties.
Despite the University’s reasonable efforts to anticipate all eventualities in drafting these procedures, it is possible unanticipated or extraordinary circumstances may not be specifically or reasonably addressed by the express policy language, in which case the University retains discretion to respond to the unanticipated or extraordinary circumstance in a way that is not clearly unreasonable.
These procedures are not contractual in nature. Accordingly, the University retains discretion to revise these procedures at any time, and for any reason. The University may apply revisions to an active case provided that doing so is not clearly unreasonable.

PolicyPurpose: To outline the University’s policies on nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and affirmative action.
Campus: EdwardsLawrenceJuniper GardensParsonsYoderTopekaMedical Center, Kansas CitySalinaWichitaPolicy Statement: As a premier learning and research institution, the University of Kansas must continuously address issues of diversity and multiculturalism. Every member of the university community is expected to engage in action that leads towards the development of a more democratic and inclusive community. Proactive efforts towards increasing diversity and the elimination of discrimination are necessary in our university.
In accordance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11246, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Jobs for Veterans Act of 2002, the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination and all other applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination statutes, the University of Kansas prohibits discrimination.
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, and genetic information in the university's programs and activities.  Retaliation is also prohibited by university policy. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policies and are the Title IX coordinators for their respective campuses: Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, 913-588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas medical center campuses).
The University of Kansas is committed to the full participation of previously excluded or neglected classes of people. Thus, it is also the policy of the university to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, and gender expression. The university's nondiscrimination policy extends to employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions and all other educational programs and activities of the university and its affiliates. It also extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and associates that may arise as a result of a discrimination complaint. Leaders in the university community continuously examine all areas of the institution, make policy decisions, and implement strategies to eliminate and prevent discrimination wherever necessary. Reports of discrimination shall be evaluated promptly and acted upon in the manner deemed necessary by the appropriate faculty, staff, and administrators and as prescribed by the appropriate grievance procedure.
The University of Kansas is also proud of its goal to help all individuals realize their potential. To this end, the university is committed to providing an equal opportunity for all qualified individuals to be considered for employment, benefits and conditions of employment, educational programs and activities, regardless of race, religion, color, ethnicity, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic information. University leaders and supervisory personnel shall recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles utilizing only valid requirements related to the position functions. A university community that provides equal opportunity in hiring and all conditions of employment will make significant strides towards the elimination of discrimination. Thus, the University of Kansas applauds every effort to create a positive working and learning environment for all individuals.
In addition to providing a discrimination-free community and equal opportunity for all persons, the university is committed to taking specific, result-oriented steps to increase the number of historically underrepresented persons and increase overall diversity. Cultural and intellectual diversity are critical components of premier learning communities. Thus, the university will actively recruit and encourage applications from underrepresented group members and will endeavor to provide a positive and supportive environment for members of these groups.
The university shall monitor its efforts to increase diversity through its Affirmative Action Plans. The university's Plans shall outline strategic initiatives and set goals to increase the representation of underrepresented group members.
Paramount to the success of the affirmative action program are the actions of university leaders. University officials at all levels are expected to establish a plan and implement procedures that help to meet the university's goals. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff are charged with the responsibility of responding to complaints of discrimination, monitoring university procedures regarding equal opportunity, setting goals, and monitoring and evaluating the university's progress towards its affirmative action goals.

Definitions: Sexual Harassment: “Sexual Harassment” is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment: “Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment” is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment: “Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a manner that does not interfere with First Amendment Free Speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employee’s official duties.  Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employee’s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive.  In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
Gender Identity: The gender that a person claims for oneself – which may or may not align with the gender assigned to the person at birth.
Gender Expression: How a person behaves, appears, or presents oneself with regard to societal expectations of gender. This may include clothing, hairstyle, facial make-up, vocal inflection, posture, and behavior regardless of the individual’s biological sex.
University Employee: includes faculty, unclassified academic staff, unclassified professional staff, University Support Staff (Lawrence/Edwards Campus), classified staff (UMKC), and all student employees, regardless of nature of appointment.

PolicyPurpose: Racial and ethnic discrimination is a violation of federal and state law, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination.
Campus: EdwardsLawrenceJuniper GardensParsonsYoderTopekaPolicy Statement: The University of Kansas, Lawrence, is committed to programs and activities that are free of racial or ethnic discrimination. To carry out the mission of this institution, the university community must provide and maintain a working and learning environment that fosters respect among all members of the community. The University’s goal is to provide an environment where individuals are free to develop intellectually, personally, professionally, and socially without intimidation or fear. Intimidation and harassment affect not only those who suffer the harassment but also the entire community. Racial and ethnic discrimination is a violation of federal and state law, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination.
“Unlawful harassment cannot and will not be tolerated at state universities.  Each state university shall develop and maintain specific policies that seek to: (i) identify prohibited conduct in this area; (ii) educate campus constituencies with regard to this negative behavior; (iii) eliminate such behavior; and (iv) set forth the manner in which such behaviors or conduct is to be addressed.”
The University prohibits racial and ethnic harassment. Racial and ethnic harassment is a form of illegal discrimination and is contrary to the nature and mission of our institution. It may take many forms, from outright criminal acts (e.g., assault and battery, vandalism, or destruction of property) to anonymous, malicious intimidation. Whatever its form, however, racial and ethnic harassment is motivated by fear, ignorance, or hatred of ethnic and cultural differences that are perceived as threatening to the offending party. Most frequently, this harassment is directed toward those persons with ethnic visibility including, but not limited to, Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Native Americans, and Asians or Pacific Islanders. Racial or ethnic harassment will not be tolerated in the university community.
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, is committed to preventing or stopping racial harassment whenever it may occur at the university or in its programs. Campus administrators, faculty members, and supervisors who become aware of such harassment should contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX and Access to prevent continuation of the harassment.
In cases of alleged Racial or Ethnic Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Racial or Ethnic Harassment in a manner that does not interfere with the First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Racial or Ethnic Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of race or ethnicity that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employee’s official duties. Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of race or ethnicity by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employee’s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive. In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression and genetic information in the University’s programs and activities. Retaliation is also prohibited by university policy. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policies and are the Title IX coordinators for their respective campuses: Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, 913-588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas medical center campuses).
“Racial and Ethnic Harassment” that is prohibited under this policy is conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) on the basis of race or ethnicity that is unwelcome and conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities. Racial and Ethnic Harassment may include, but is not limited to, unwelcome commentary about an individual’s race or ethnicity and unwelcome jokes or teasing based upon racial or ethnic stereotypes.

The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression and genetic information in the University’s programs and activities. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the non-discrimination policies: Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, Room 1082, Dole Human Development Center, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Lawrence, KS, 66045, (785)864-6414, 711 TTY (for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder, and Topeka campuses); Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 7004, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, (913) 588-8011, 711 TTY (for the Wichita, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas Medical Center campuses).
Sexual Harassment: “Sexual Harassment” is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment: “Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment” is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment: “Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a manner that does not interfere with First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employee’s official duties.  Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employee’s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive.  In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
Penetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.  An “object” or “instrument” is anything used by the offender other than the offender’s genitalia.
Touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Domestic Violence: “Domestic Violence”  is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.
Who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and
Where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
Stalking: “Stalking” is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.  For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:
(A) Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property.
(B) Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.
(C) Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.
1The University’s definition of “Sexual Assault” is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  Those regulations require the University to adopt a definition of “Sexual Assault” that incorporates various forcible and non-forcible sex crimes as defined by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting System.  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.30(a).

ProcedurePurpose: To outline the procedures for the handling of sexual harassment and sexual violence at the University of Kansas
The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination, including harassment and violence, on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Retaliation for making good faith complaints of prohibited discrimination is also prohibited by University policy. The following office has been designated to handle inquiries regarding Title IX: Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, civilrights@ku.edu, 1000 Sunnyside Avenue, Suite 1082, Lawrence, KS, 66045, 785-864-6414, 711 TTY.
“Advisor” is an individual who was not a witness or otherwise involved in the allegations of the complaint and acts as a representative for either the complaint or the respondent. An Advisor may be present for any questioning of their “client” during the investigation but is expected to play a passive role. An Advisor (does not have to be the same as during the investigation) also represents each party during the subsequent hearing and participates by questioning the opposing party. The Advisor may also question witnesses during the hearing on behalf of their party. For purposes of the hearing, an Advisor will be appointed by the University if either party does not select an Advisor for themselves.
“Complainant” is the person who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment.
"Consent” is communicated, ongoing, and mutual. This means consent is gained through words or actions that show an active, knowing and voluntary agreement to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity. It is the responsibility of the initiator, or the person who wants to engage in the specific sexual activity to make sure that the initiator has consent. Consent cannot be gained by force, by ignoring or acting without regard to the objections of another, or by taking advantage of the incapacitation of another, where the accused knows or reasonably should have known of such incapacitation. For example, a person who is intoxicated may not be capable of giving consent. Consent is also absent when the activity in question exceeds the scope of consent previously given or when the person from whom consent is sought is deemed incapable of giving consent under the law of the State of Kansas. A person always has the right to revoke Consent at any time during a sexual act. Consent to one act does not constitute consent to another act. Consent on a prior occasion does not constitute consent on a subsequent occasion. Silence, lack of resistance, or failure to say “no” does not imply consent.
Who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and
Where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
“Domestic Violence” is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.
“Education Program or Activity” includes locations, events, or circumstances over which the University of Kansas exercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs and includes houses located off campus that are owned or controlled by a recognized student organization
“Formal Complaint” is a document filed/signed by a complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment against a respondent and requesting that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX investigate the allegation of sexual harassment.
“Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a manner that does not interfere with First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employee’s official duties. Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employee’s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive. In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
“Incapacitation” means the physical and/or mental inability to make informed, rational judgments. Where alcohol and/or drugs are involved, incapacitation is defined with respect to how the alcohol or drugs consumed impact a person’s decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make fully informed judgments.
“Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment” is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
“Report” means any communication to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, by whatever form, of a belief that a violation of Title IX has occurred. A report does not constitute a formal complaint.
“Respondent” is the person who has been reported to be the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute sexual harassment or retaliation.
Penetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. An “object” or “instrument” is anything used by the offender other than the offender’s genitalia.
Touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.

“Stalking” is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.  For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:
Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property.
Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.
Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.
“Standard of Proof” in investigating and adjudicating violations under the Title IX Resolution Procedures is the preponderance of the evidence standard. The preponderance of the evidence means the fact in dispute is more likely than not to be true.
“Student” means all persons enrolled at the Lawrence and/or Edwards campuses, either full time or part time, pursuing undergraduate, graduate, or professional studies, as well as non-degree students. This also includes individuals who confirm their intent to enroll in programs, those attending orientation sessions, and those who were enrolled at the date of an alleged incident. Persons who withdraw after allegedly violating the student code or who are not officially enrolled for a particular term but who have a continuing relationship with the University are considered “students.”

The University's Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy extends to educational programs or activities of the University of Kansas and extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and an individual's associates that may arise as a result of a Title IX complaint made in good faith or otherwise participating in the Title IX resolution process. This policy does not extend to incidents that occur outside of the United States.
For incidents occurring outside of the United States or outside of the University of Kansas educational programs or activities but where an on-campus safety issue has been identified, the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process will be utilized. For cases involving a course of conduct occurring both on and off campus, the University may proceed under either the Title IX Resolution Process or the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process.
Any person with knowledge of prohibited sexual harassment, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking in the University’s employment practices or educational programs or activities may contact the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.
Reports may be filed via the online reporting form on the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX website (www.civilrights.ku.edu), by email to civilrights@ku.edu, or by phone to 785-864-6414; 711 TTY. All reports through the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX online reporting form, reports made by email or phone, and reports from third-party reporters, such as mandatory reporters, are not considered formal complaints to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will acknowledge receipt of the report within three (3) working days. A person need not have University affiliation to submit a report of discrimination.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX’s goal at all times is to protect, to the extent possible, individuals’ access to University educational programs and activities. Accordingly, upon receiving a report of sexual harassment, the Office of Civil Rights will offer and implement appropriate supportive measures to the complainant and respondent, as appropriate, before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed.
Such measures will be non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services, including but not limited to a mutual directive to the parties to have no contact with each other (a “No Contact Directive”), changes to living arrangements, changes to class schedules, counseling, campus escort services, and other measures designed to restore or preserve access to the educational programs and activities, protect the safety of all parties and the educational environment, and to deter harassment and retaliation. Such measures will not be unduly burdensome to either party and will not require a fee or charge.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will implement supportive measures to the extent possible as appropriate and as reasonably available.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will keep supportive measures confidential to the extent that the confidentiality would not impair the ability of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX to provide the supportive measures.
Upon completion of an individualized safety and risk analysis, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that a respondent poses an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or individual exists and make a recommendation to the VPSA for the emergency removal of the student due to the allegation(s) of sexual harassment. The VPSA may also complete the individualized health and safety risk analysis and remove the respondent. The respondent will be notified of the removal decision in writing and shall have an opportunity to challenge the removal decision pursuant to the Student Non-Academic Conduct Procedures.
Employees of the University may be placed on administrative leave during the pendency of the Title IX processes including the investigative process and hearing process.
The University takes all discrimination complaints seriously. However, knowingly filing a false complaint is considered serious misconduct and is also subject to sanction. An individual who establishes a pattern of repeatedly filing frivolous complaints that harass colleagues and/or abuse the complaint resolution process may lose the right to file complaints for a specified period of time. Such cases shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of University Senate Rules and Regulations section 6.5.4, Abuse of Grievance Process.
The process for responding to Title IX complaints may include informal resolution (which may include mediation, restorative justice, or other educational resolutions), formal investigations, or supportive measures (which are available during both informal resolutions and formal investigations). If the subject matter or issue of the complaint does not fall under this policy, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff may advise the complainant of other available procedures.
Complainants are encouraged to file their formal complaints within one hundred eighty (180) days of any occurrence of alleged discrimination. A formal complaint must be made while the complainant is still enrolled which the University of Kansas, intends to re-enroll in the University of Kansas, employed by the University of Kansas, or participating or attempting to participate in an education program of the University of Kansas.
The Title IX Coordinator, in their discretion, may file a signed formal complaint regarding the alleged violation of the Sexual Harassment Policy. Situations where the Title IX Coordinator might file a formal complaint include incidents involving weapons, incidents involving multiple respondents, situations where the respondent has multiple reports alleging violations of the sexual harassment policy, the complainant is a minor, or other situations where the Title IX Coordinator feels it is necessary to protect the campus community.
A report or formal complaint of sexual harassment or retaliation to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX should include the following, to the extent known and available:
Nature of the alleged sexual harassment (i.e., sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, stalking, or retaliation);
To remove barriers of reporting and participation in the investigative and hearing process under the University’s Sexual Harassment Policy, student parties including complainants, respondents, and witnesses shall not be subjected to discipline under the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities for the personal consumption of alcohol and/or drugs. The Director of Student Conduct and Community Standards may at their discretion assign educational interventions when there is concern regarding the safety of a student in connection to the student’s alcohol or drug use.
Employees may be referred to Human Resource Management for violations of the Alcohol & Drug Policy.
Upon receipt of a report, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly reach out to the complainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures with or without filing a formal complaint and explain to the complainant the process for filing a formal complaint as well as the opportunity to meet with the Title IX Coordinator. During the initial meeting, the complainant has the option of requesting supportive measures as well as filing a formal complaint. The complainant also has the option of requesting the University to take no further action on the report. When the complainant requests that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX take no action, the Title IX Coordinator reserves the right to file a signed formal complaint.
Upon receiving a formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall conduct an initial evaluation of the formal complaint and determine the appropriate action required. Where the University or its employees are accused of sexual harassment, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX staff will contact the dean, director, administrator, supervisor, or chairperson responsible for the unit that is accused of sexual harassment to inform them of the filing of the formal complaint. When necessary, appropriate administrator(s) or faculty member(s) may be designated by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Vice Provost, Dean, Director, or Chairperson, by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or by the Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX to participate in the evaluation of the formal complaint and to facilitate necessary action.
In conducting its initial review of the formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may meet with the Complainant or take other steps to learn the basis of the formal complaint, including examining University records.
The conduct alleged in the formal complaint would not constitute sexual harassment even if proved,
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may dismiss a formal complaint if at any time during the investigation:
A complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein;
The complaint was filed when the complainant was not participating or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of the University; or
Specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.
If it is determined that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will not proceed with investigation of a formal complaint, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will notify the complainant (if not anonymous) and respondent in writing explaining the reasons why the complaint is not being investigated under Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may notify the complainant that their formal complaint will be investigated under the Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process or that the matter is being referred to another office for review. The notification letter will include a statement regarding the complainant and respondent right to appeal the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX decision if no formal investigation will occur under this policy.
A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy, and articulates sufficient facts, which if determined to be accurate, would support a finding that the University's Sexual Harassment Policy has been violated.
Respondents are presumed not to be responsible for the allegations of the complaint until a conclusion is reached at the end of the investigation.
The University will strive to complete investigations of formal complaints, including issuance of a report of findings to the complainant and respondent, in as timely and efficient a manner as possible within sixty (60) working days of receipt of a complaint. However, this timeframe may be extended based on factors such as, but not limited to, schedule and availability of witnesses, concurrent law enforcement activity, holidays or semester breaks including summer break, and complexity of the complaint. If an investigation cannot be completed within sixty (60) working days of receipt of the complaint, then the investigator(s) will notify the complainant and respondent the investigation timeframe is being extended and provide a timeframe for completing the investigation.
Investigators assigned to conduct an investigation will be impartial. In conducting investigations into violations of the University’s Policies, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will use a preponderance of the evidence standard in making factual determinations. The preponderance of the evidence means the fact in dispute is more likely than not to be true. The investigation will include the following elements:
Contact with Complainant. If the investigator did not speak with the complainant at the time that the formal complaint was received by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, then the investigator will meet or speak with the complainant at the start of the investigation and throughout the investigation as appropriate.
Notice to Respondent. The respondent will be provided with a statement of the complaint in writing, and the complainant will be provided a copy of this notification. The notice will include:
That the respondent is presumed not to be responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination will be reached at the end of the investigation;
The web address where the Title IX Resolution Process and Title IX Hearing Procedures can be found;
The respondent’s right to an advisor (who may be an attorney) of the respondent’s choice and to review all evidence gathered prior to the conclusion of the investigation; and
That University policies prohibit knowingly making false statement or submitting false information during the investigation process.
Respondents will be provided an opportunity to meet with the investigator(s) investigating the complaint and to respond to the allegation and to meet or speak with the investigator throughout the investigation as appropriate. Respondents may respond in person or in writing within a reasonable time to be determined by the investigators. If a respondent chooses not to participate or refuses to answer a complaint, the nonparticipation will not prevent the investigation from proceeding.
Notice regarding Retaliation. All parties to a complaint (complainant, respondent, witnesses, and appropriate administrators or supervisors) will be informed that retaliation, defined in Section VI, by an individual or an individual's associates against any person who files a complaint or any person who participates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation are subject to disciplinary action.
Representation. In any meeting with the investigators, the parties to the complaint (complainant and the respondent) may bring an advisor to the meeting, up to three (3). If the advisor is an attorney, the party must notify the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing at least three (3) working days before the meeting date.
Notice of all Meetings. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide to a party whose participation is invited or expected, written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purposes of all meetings including investigative interviews. Email is the primary form of written communication for the University of Kansas and the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide sufficient time to prepare to participate by allowing at least three (3) working-day’s notice unless the party requests a date and time allowing less than three (3) working days.
Information relevant to Investigation. The complainant and respondent will be informed that they have the opportunity to identify witnesses, present witness statements, and submit any other evidence they believe relevant to resolution of the complaint. The investigator(s) will interview other persons whom, at the investigator(s)' discretion determines to be necessary to gather relevant information. The investigator(s) will review any written materials, e- mails, text messages, or other evidence that, at the investigator(s)’ discretion, may provide relevant information regarding the complaint. The burden of gathering evidence rests on the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.
Medical Records.  No reports will be accessed, disclosed, or used that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in their capacity, or assisting in that capacity, which are made and maintained in connection to the treatment of the party without that party’s voluntary and written consent to do so.
Privileged Information.  The investigator will not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding the privilege has waived the privilege.
Witness Summary.  Witnesses may request, and Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide, a reasonable opportunity to review the investigator’s summary of that individual’s interview and the opportunity to submit a written response to the summary.
Review of Evidence and Preliminary Report. Upon completion of the preliminary investigation report, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will provide the complainant and respondent, as well as the advisor of each party, an opportunity to inspect and review all evidence collected during the course of the investigation to include summaries of investigative interviews, physical evidence, inculpatory evidence, exculpatory evidence, and evidence upon which the investigator has collected but does not intend to rely. The complainant and respondent, and advisor to each party, will have ten (10) calendar days to submit a written response to the evidence. The investigator will consider the written responses prior to the completion of the final investigative report.
Final Investigative Report. After the end of the ten (10) calendar day period during which the complainant and respondent have the ability to review all evidence and preliminary report, the investigator will objectively evaluate all relevant evidence – including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence – and will draft a final investigative report. The investigative report will fairly summarize relevant evidence.
A copy of the final investigative report will be provided simultaneously to both parties, as well as the advisor for each party, and to the appropriate administrator(s).
The hearing panel is not bound by the relevance determinations in the investigative report and the final decision as to relevance shall be made by the Hearing Panel Chair.
Upon completion of the final investigative report, the report will be forwarded to the appropriate administrator(s) for the scheduling of a live hearing. The live hearing will be scheduled for no sooner than fourteen (14) calendar days. Live hearings will contain, at a minimum, the opportunity to cross exam parties through a party’s advisor. If a party does not have an advisor, one will be provided by the University for the live hearing. All live hearings will be subject to the Hearing Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Harassment.
No person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing. Disciplinary action, harassment, unsupported evaluations, or other adverse changes in the conditions of employment or the educational environment may also constitute retaliation. Retaliation will not be tolerated and could result in suspension, reassignment, salary reduction, termination, expulsion, or other disciplinary action. Formal complaints of retaliation related to investigations under the policy will be handled under the Title IX Resolution Process.
Nothing in this retaliation section limits the ability of the complainant and respondent to discuss the allegation under investigation or to gather and present relevant evidence. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute retaliation. Charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a grievance proceeding under this part does not constitute retaliation.
If a complainant or respondent believes that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX has erred in its decision to administratively close the complaint without a full investigation, that party may appeal the closure to the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, within seven (7) calendar days of the date of the notice of the investigator's findings. The request for an appeal must be a signed, written document articulating why the investigator's dismissal of the formal complaint is erroneous.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, shall notify the other party and the Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX in writing of an appeal of the dismissal of formal complaint and allow the other party seven (7) calendar days to submit a written statement. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX may also be asked to submit a response or to provide additional information regarding the case.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, will respond to the appeal in writing to both complainant and respondent within twenty (20) calendar days of receiving the respondent’s written statement or the conclusion of the seven (7) calendar days to submit a statement. This decision on appeal will constitute final agency action and there will be no further appeal within the University.
The Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost or designee, will not conduct a new investigation of the Complaint or substitute their judgment for that of the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX. Rather, on appeal, the Complainant must show that the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX has erred in one or more of the following ways and that the error caused actual prejudice to the outcome of the investigation:
There was procedural irregularity by the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX that affected the outcome of the matter.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX improperly failed to gather or consider information relevant to the complaint.
Based upon the totality of the information in the record, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.
New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of the dismissal that could affect the outcome of the matter.
The Title IX Coordinator or investigator had a conflict of interest for or against complainants and respondents generally or the individual complainant and respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.
After submission of a formal complaint, either party may request an opportunity to resolve the complaint through an informal resolution process. If requested by one party, the other party must voluntarily agree to participate in order for the informal resolution process to proceed. A successful resolution and agreement of the parties will result in dismissal of the complaint without further investigation or hearing. Prior to reaching an agreement, either party may withdraw from the process and request that the grievance procedures pursuant to this policy resume.
An informal resolution process will be facilitated by an individual who is trained, unbiased and without conflict. The informal resolution process will be conducted in accordance with informal resolution procedures.
The informal resolution process is not available when the complaint alleges a violation by an employee against a student.
Members of the University community who are found to have violated the University’s Sexual Harassment Policy are subject to disciplinary actions appropriate to their status as faculty, staff, or student employees or as students. Disciplinary actions can range from a warning to a dismissal or termination. Disciplinary actions for students can be found in section VII of the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, disciplinary actions for faculty can be found in Article VI of the Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, and disciplinary actions for Staff can be found in the Disciplinary Action Policy for Staff.
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX will handle all discrimination and harassment complaints discreetly but cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity because the University has an obligation to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment and to maintain a safe environment, free from harassment and discrimination. Because of its obligations under the law, KU will not be able to honor all requests for confidentiality or all requests that a complaint not be pursued.
Employees may file employment discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. Students may file discrimination complaints through the Office of Civil Rights in the U. S. Department of Education or the Kansas Human Rights Commission. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX can provide information about deadlines and filing procedures for the state and federal agencies.
The University will maintain all records of each sexual harassment investigation for a period of seven (7) years to include any determination regarding responsibility, any audio or audiovisual recording or transcript, any disciplinary sanctions imposed on the respondent, any remedies provided to the complainant designed to restore and preserve access to the University’s educational programs or activities, any appeals and the results therefrom, and informal resolutions and the results therefrom, and all materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and any person who facilitates an informal resolution process.
For each report and formal complaint falling under this Title IX process, before closing the file, the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX shall document all actions taken in response and all measures taken to restore or preserve access to educational programs and activities of the University. The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX also shall document the basis for its conclusion that the University’s response was not deliberately indifferent, and where no supportive measures have been provided, why the University’s response was not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.

The Museum Studies Program (MUSE) offers training in the discipline of Museum Studies, and (1) prepares graduates for professional careers in museums and related institutions; (2) encourages innovative multidisciplinary research in museum studies; and (3) seeks opportunities for engagement by students and faculty to enhance the professionalism of museums in the state and the region. The graduate program in Museum Studies provides a comprehensive overview of the discipline, opportunities for mastering core components of museum practice, avenues for exploring museums from an interdisciplinary perspective, solid grounding in contemporary issues facing museums, and possibilities for research to develop new and innovative approaches in the field.
The program is concerned with the principles and practices of acquisition, management, conservation, and utilization of museum and archival collections; the development and implementation of educational, exhibition, and research programs and services for the public; the nature and history of organizations housing collections; and the philosophy and practices of administration pertaining to these organizations.
Since 1981, the Museum Studies Program has offered professional training for careers in museums, historical agencies, and related institutions. The Museum Studies Program offers a range of courses that address the theories, history, techniques, and problems common to museums and cultural institutions, as well as the specialized operations of such institutions. Students receive classroom and field training in methods and subject matter in their chosen area of concentration. The University of Kansas offers a broad range of opportunities for museum studies training and experience beyond the classroom, including museums of art, classics, history, natural history, politics, and athletics; archival, manuscript, and rare book collections; historical societies; as well as related administrative and research activities. A graduate of the program is prepared for professional practice in the world of museums.
The mission of the Museum Studies Program is to produce graduates prepared to advance museums, historical and cultural agencies, and similar institutions in the state, region, and nation. Drawing on the expertise of outstanding faculty, the skills of accomplished area museum professionals, and the rich resources of institutions at KU and in nearby communities, the Museum Studies Program:
1. The Museum Studies Program is administered by the Director in consultation with the Museum Studies Executive Committee (see II(B)2) and includes faculty and staff in various roles.
2. The Program is bound in its action by University regulations, particularly as expressed in the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff. Reference should be made to these regulations in all cases since the bylaws and other policies and practices of the department are supplementary to the main body of University regulation.
a. The Director is the administrative and operating head of Museum Studies, the chairperson of the Museum Studies Executive Committee, and an ex officio member of any other Museum Studies committees or subcommittees. The Director is the official representative of Museum Studies with other departments, divisions, programs, and administrators of the University, except in those cases when the Director or the faculty, acting jointly and with the Director's consent, specifically designate another Museum Studies faculty member, instructor, or administrative staff to represent the Director.
b. The Director is responsible for the smooth functioning of the Museum Studies Program. The Director calls Museum Studies Executive Committee meetings, directs and oversees Museum Studies programs, initiates and/or carries through curricular and other changes in the program, manages faculty appointed in MUSE, appoints and oversees Museum Studies staff and lecturers, supervises the Museum Studies budget, applies Museum Studies and University rules as appropriate, and performs other normal tasks as required by the College and other University administrative units.
c. The Director serves at the pleasure of the Executive Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and reports to the contact Associate Dean for the Program.
e. In those cases in which MUSE's position has been clearly reached in consultation with the Museum Studies Executive Committee, the Director acts and speaks for the unit. Consequently, in all matters on which the Director needs to act on behalf of MUSE, it is desirable that the Director should ascertain by consultation the will of MUSE, and act accordingly. Consultation may take many forms. This statement is in no way to be construed as inhibiting the right of the Director to speak as an individual faculty member when appropriate.
f. The Director’s term in office is determined by the Executive Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, but is usually for a period of three to five years, renewable.

As a nationally and internationally prominent department at a major research university, KU historians appreciate the complexity and diversity of the human experience, question simple explanations, evaluate evidence in multiple forms, and offer insightful interpretations with clarity of expression. We
Educate undergraduate students about the value of intellectual curiosity, empathetic and critical thinking, and historical understanding.
The Department of History seeks to work with others across KU, throughout the country, and around the world to foster understanding of the complex origins of today’s world and its challenges and to aid in intelligent decision-making about the future.
We aspire to be a leading student-centered, research-intensive department that attracts and retains talented and intellectually curious students from across Kansas and beyond. We aim to have strong faculty and staff members who contribute to the department, the University, the community, and the world through the excellence of our teaching, research, and service. We seek to provide a welcoming, supportive environment for learning and working where differences are valued and all persons are offered an equitable opportunity to achieve their academic and professional goals.
We believe that a critical understanding of the past is foundational to a sustainable future in which social and cultural diversity is appreciated. We accomplish our mission through the lens of shared values. Our goal is to be:
The department recognizes that it is bound in its action by University regulations, particularly as expressed in the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff. Reference should be made to these regulations in all cases since the bylaws and other policies and practices of the department are supplementary to the main body of University regulation.
Within the limits imposed by these bylaws, the Chairperson of the department shall conduct departmental meetings in the manner most likely to ensure free, open, and orderly discussion. When questions of procedure arise, appeal should be made to the latest edition of Robert’s Rules of Order.
Before the beginning of classes each semester, the Chairperson will typically schedule five regular departmental meetings (including the annual convocation), to be held at three- to four- week intervals over the course of the semester. Except in exceptional circumstances announced well in advance, these meetings will be held from 10:30 to noon on Friday and last no more than one and one-half hours.
Voting members of the department shall consist of those holding tenure-track professorships, teaching professorships, and other continuing multi-year appointments in the department (such as lecturers or visiting professors), as well as those students who have been duly elected or appointed as representatives to the department. The voting membership will be confined to persons holding tenure-track or continuing multi-year appointments in the department for final hiring decisions, promotion and tenure recommendations, faculty and student evaluation, policies governing student academic standards, and other matters explicitly delimited by departmental bylaws. Student representatives cannot vote on these matters, and in some cases do not attend meetings in which these matters are discussed. Professors emeriti of the department are encouraged to participate in meetings in an advisory capacity, but do not have a voting role.
At departmental meetings, the number of student representatives will be determined as follows: students will represent a number less than or equal to 20 percent of the permanent faculty. Two of these voting members will be undergraduates; the balance of these voting members will be graduate students.
Graduate student members are elected annually by the department’s History Graduate Student Organization (HGSO).
Undergraduate representatives are recommended by the Undergraduate Committee and appointed by the Chairperson.
A quorum must be present at a departmental meeting in order for any vote to be held. Presentations and discussions may take place in the absence of a quorum. A quorum will be determined by the following procedure:
At the start of each semester, the quorum number will be calculated by counting the number of faculty holding tenure-track or continuing multi-year appointments, dividing this number by three and rounding up to the nearest whole number.
A quorum is constituted when the number of faculty holding tenure-track or continuing appointments present at a departmental meeting meets or exceeds the quorum number.
The presence of student representative at a meeting does not contribute to the determination of a quorum.
With the exception of bylaws revisions and general announcements, all agenda items must be distributed electronically to the members of the department before noon two business days preceding the meeting at which they will be discussed or acted upon. This rule may be waived by the majority consent of voting members present at the meeting.
The Department Chair may call for a vote via email ballot for time-sensitive business that arises between regularly scheduled departmental meetings. Voting rights for email ballots are the same as voting rights for departmental meetings. For an email vote to be valid, the total number of votes cast by faculty must be greater than or equal to the number needed to constitute a quorum at a regular departmental meeting. Email ballots will be distributed and collected by the department’s administrative associate, who will convey the outcome to the Department Chair while protecting the confidentiality of the votes. The Chair will announce these results to the department. Under some circumstances (such as election of members of thePersonnel Committee), the Chair may use paper ballots for holding departmental votes outside regular meetings. Unless otherwise stipulated by departmental bylaws, the rules governing paper ballots will be the same as email ballots.
The right to vote has special importance at departmental meetings called to discuss major issues, such as promotion and tenure recommendations, the appointment of faculty or the Department Chair, and bylaw revisions. If a department member with voting rights on a major issue is unable to attend in person in the course of their professional duties, such as attending an out-of-town conference or research leave, provision can be made to attend and vote at a departmental meeting in a virtual manner using the following procedure:
The absentee shall provide a written statement to the presiding chair that appoints a proxy in attendance at the departmental meeting.
The absentee shall be admitted to virtual attendance based on the majority vote of those in attendance.
It is the proxy’s responsibility to arrange and handle the interface for the absentee’s virtual attendance, which should enable the absentee to hear discussion and to communicate questions, comments, and their vote.
When voting, the proxy should fill out a ballot on behalf of the absentee with the direct assistance of the presiding chair, who will then include the ballot in tabulations of the departmental vote, while otherwise protecting its confidentiality.
As an alternative, faculty members unable to attend a meeting in person may submit a concise signed opinion to the presiding chair to be shared during general faculty discussion.
The role of the secretary for each regular and special departmental meeting is to take minutes. The secretary has the responsibility to convey them in a timely manner to the Department Chair and administrative associate, including a complete and accurate text of all formally adopted provisions.  The responsibility of secretary will circulate alphabetically through the regular faculty and teaching professors.
The Department Chairperson is the administrative and operating head of the department, the chair of departmental meetings, and an ex officio member of all departmental committees. The Chair is also the representative of the department with other units, departments, divisions, and administrators of the university, except in those cases when another member of the department has been specifically designated to act in that capacity. The Chair’s main duties include:
Administering the undergraduate and graduate academic programs of the unit, including the appointment in consultation with the Personnel Committee of a Director of Undergraduate Studies, Director of Graduate Studies, and committees to oversee these activities.
Reviewing and revising long-range plans for the unit, in consultation with the unit’s Personnel Committee.
Seeking to enhance resources available to the unit by actively seeking internal and external funding Developing strategies, implementing plans, and organizing events for fundraising, including maintaining contact information for alumni and donors. Assisting KU Endowment and the College with fundraising initiatives that will benefit the department.
Developing and enhancing research and educational relationships between the unit and other units across the College and University, as well as with agencies outside the University, public and private.
Cultivating future leadership for the department by mentoring faculty members and providing leadership opportunities.
Executing College and University policy within the unit effectively. Informing and updating department faculty on changes to College and University policies that affect the History Department, and relaying to department faculty pertinent information from the meetings of chairs and program directors that affects the History Department.
Serving as the main administrator, PI, or co-PI for grants originated by the department. (The PI would typically be a faculty member whose area of expertise lies in the area of the grant.)
Appointing other departmental officers, faculty representatives, and employees to perform designated tasks.
Maintaining, in consultation with the Personnel Committee, accurate, up-to-date versions of departmental bylaws and policies that are posted on the departmental website.
Hearing recommendations and complaints about faculty, staff, or students. When appropriate, the Chair will communicate these to University administration, or when relevant to Annual Faculty Evaluation or committee service, to the Personnel Committee.
B. The Chairperson, when acting in that capacity, routinely speaks and acts on behalf of the department as a whole. Consequently, it is vital for the Chairperson to ascertain the will of the department by consultation and to act on that will. It is recognized that this consultation may take many forms and that this requirement in no way inhibits the right of the Chairperson to speak and act as an individual.
C. The Personnel Committee is designated to serve the Chair in a general advisory capacity, and may advise the Dean on the Chair’s performance when appropriate.
D. The term of office of the Chairperson shall be three to five years. Term length is to be determined by agreement between the incoming chairperson and the Dean of the College, and whatever agreement is reached will be promptly communicated to the department. Extension of the term of office of the Chairperson for more than one year beyond the original term requires consultation with faculty at a departmental meeting.
The selection of the Department Chair should reference current College policy on the matter: see http://policy.ku.edu/CLAS/procedures-for-selection-of-chairs. For the purpose of voting, the selection of a Chair is considered a personnel matter. In the case of an external search, the department will also follow bylaws for faculty appointments. In either case, the following procedure is required:
The Dean meets with voting members of the unit to review procedures and charge them to initiate the search.
Voting members of the department appoint a search committee and name a chair for it. The search committee chair must be a tenured member of the department.
The search committee prepares a position description and presents it to voting members for discussion and approval and then to the College Dean’s Office for final approval.
In conjunction with the Dean’s Office and SSC, the position announcement is uploaded to the University’s hiring system and published more broadly if it involves an external search.
The search committee reviews applicants and conducts interviews with the most promising candidates. Traditionally, interviews have been conducted with the committee of the whole.
The search committee presents its recommendations to the unit, and the unit’s voting members identify candidate strengths and weaknesses and vote for their preferred candidate in a manner that will preserve the confidentiality of their votes. Student representatives are encouraged to participate in the initial discussion that follows the search committee’s recommendation, but are not allowed to vote and should vacate the room during general discussion by faculty entitled to vote on personnel matters. Faculty members must attend the meeting in person or via the procedure for virtual attendance to be eligible to vote.
Voting procedure: After the search committee chair closes discussion, each member entitled to vote on personnel decisions will receive a series of ballots with all finalist names.
Each voting member will vote for their ONE favored candidate and designate any candidate they consider “unacceptable.”
Any candidate deemed unacceptable by the majority of voters at any point will be designated unacceptable by the department.
If no candidate receives a majority on the ballot, the lowest vote recipient will be eliminated from consideration on the subsequent ballot. Voting will continue until a majority agrees on a top-ranked candidate.
This procedure will be repeated for ranking the remaining finalists until all finalists are ranked.
In the case of a persistent tie, the search committee chair will communicate a tied ranking to the Dean.
The ranking that results from this vote and the list of strengths and weaknesses produced by the search committee (modified as appropriate after meeting discussion) will provide the principal basis for the department’s recommendation for appointment to the Dean and other University administration. After ranking is completed, the search committee chair will inform official student representatives of this outcome, so that they can inform other interested students, taking care to protect the confidentiality of the outcome and process.
A. Associate Chairperson: The Associate Chair is appointed and supervised by the Chairperson and has the following duties:
Determining the department’s schedule of courses, including which courses are offered and the dates and times of instruction. In setting the course schedule, the Associate Chair sends out a call each fall semester for faculty to recommend courses for the subsequent academic year and consults with the Graduate and Undergraduate Directors and relevant groups of faculty with shared teaching interests.
Overseeing and evaluating the performance of limited-term and multi-year lecturers, visiting professors, and similar appointments, when appropriate.
Taking the place of the Chairperson when they are unavailable or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the Chair, both for internal matters and when representing the department to outside units.
Monitoring student credit hour production and the number of undergraduate majors and minors and pursuing strategies to maintain or grow these numbers.
The Director of Graduate Studies is appointed and supervised by the Chairperson. The main duty of the Director of Graduate Studies is to preside over the department’s graduate program and the Graduate Committee. If the Chair and Associate Chair are unable to perform the duties of Chairperson, the Director of Graduate Studies will substitute.
Ensuring that departmental protocols and policies for graduate students conform to College and University standards.
Ministering to the questions and concerns of present, past, and prospective graduate students and of faculty regarding the graduate program.
In collaboration with the History Graduate Student Organization, planning and executing the annual Prospective Students Visit for newly admitted students.

D. Department officers are normally given ten-month appointments. The Chairperson will request supplemental summer salary for these positions from the College, and with approval of the Dean, will provide a one-course reduction in teaching responsibilities each year. Upon conclusion of a three-year term in the position, the Chairperson will recommend to the Dean a one-semester Special Research Assignment.
As our official leaders, the Chairperson and Department Officers are primarily responsible for strategic planning for the department and will do so in close consultation with other departmental committees and department members as a whole. Strategic planning involves envisioning desired futures for the department and formulating concrete goals that can be translated into operational plans and actions. It also involves accounting for the financial resources available for achieving these goals and planning for contingencies. Every three to five years, or at moments when requested by the Dean or University administration, such as before and after an External Review, the Chair and Department Officers will draw up a long-term Strategic Plan for the department, which they will submit to the department for discussion and approval. Each academic year, the Chair and Department Officers will make an annual assessment of the Strategic Plan’s progress, deficiencies, and intervening contingencies; discuss this assessment at a departmental meeting; and make appropriate alterations and amendments to the Strategic Plan. Whenever possible, this will be done in parallel with the discussion of priorities in hiring, following the procedure outlined under Faculty Appointments.
Procedures for additions to the regular faculty and teaching professors will be governed by the Handbook for Faculty and Unclassified Staff and Guidelines on Academic Appointments of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, available at http://policy.ku.edu/CLAS/academic- appointments. No one may become a permanent member of the department without the support of the majority vote of the members of the department present or virtually present at a regular or special meeting. Student representatives and emeriti faculty may not vote on faculty appointments.
Differential Allocations of Effort are governed by the Provost’s policy, available at: http://policy.ku.edu/provost/DAE. The Department of History normally expects tenured and tenure-track faculty to devote 40 percent of their effort to research, 40 percent to teaching, and 20 percent to service to the university, community, and profession, and it typically applies these weights when evaluating faculty performance. Teaching professors are normally expected to devote 10 percent to research, 75 percent to teaching, and 10 percent to service, with the additional 5 percent of effort allocated by contract to one of those three categories.
Changes in the standard allocation of effort or an existing DAE can be initiated by the faculty member or Department Chair. Reasons for Differential Allocation of Effort can include short- term alterations, such as research-intensive semesters or funded research, or longer-term alterations related to career stage, performance, editorial or administrative appointments, or other issues. Departmental needs take precedence over individual needs when making decisions to alter a faculty member’s Allocation of Effort, and redistribution must be consistent with the best interests of the unit.
If a faculty member would like to make a DAE agreement, whether temporary or permanent, they should make this request to the Department Chair, who will consult with the appropriate Dean about the feasibility of the request. Any changes to faculty Allocation of Effort will be documented in the faculty member’s personnel file and made available to the Personnel Committee for the purpose of annual evaluation. If the faculty member and Chairperson disagree about the DAE, the faculty member may request a non-binding review by an ad-hoc faculty committee designated to hear such matters. Long-term DAEs must be reviewed at least every three years.
Each year as requested by the Dean, voting members of the department will suggest and discuss potential hires and produce, by vote, a ranked list of priorities in hiring. The Chairperson will initiate this process and convey this list to the Dean with appropriate explanations for those hires and their ranking.
Discussion and voting procedure: In advance of the departmental meeting at which potential hires will be discussed, the ranked list of suggestions for future hires from the previous year will be distributed to members of the department. Each voting member of the department (including student representatives) is requested to submit a ranked list of up to five suggestions for future hires and turn in this preliminary ranking to the department’s administrative associate for tabulation. In consultation with Department Officers, the Department Chair will group suggestions that are very similar for the purpose of tabulating this preliminary list and to solicit further suggestions inspired by departmental teaching needs. The resulting non-binding tabulation will be circulated to the department and provide a starting point for discussion. From the list of possible positions discussed at the meeting, each voter should list on a ballot as many positions as desired; rank these selections numerically from highest preference to lowest preference; and turn in this ranking for tabulation to the department’s administrative associate who will maintain their confidentiality. Voters may also write in positions that were not discussed. For both the preliminary and final votes, one point will be allocated for each first- place vote; 1/2 point for each second-place vote; 1/3 point for each third-place vote; 1/4 point for each fourth-place vote; and so forth. The final list of positions submitted to the Dean will be ranked based on the number of points received from the total vote, and the final ranked list and points will be reported to the department as a whole. Ties will be reported in alphabetical order as ties. Votes for positions that are very similar may be combined or disaggregated in the preliminary and final rankings at the discretion of the Chair.
Recommendations for potential direct hires, including domestic partner accommodations and Langston Hughes Professorships, should be directed to the Department Chairperson. The Chair will then consult with the Dean and the department about the feasibility of such a hire.
Once a position has been authorized, the Chairperson will appoint a search committee to conduct preliminary evaluations of candidates. The search committee will be composed of faculty from relevant fields, faculty from the department at large, a graduate student representative, a member external to the department, and the total should be an odd number to avoid tie votes. The graduate student and external representative vote as members of the committee, but do not vote on final departmental hiring decisions. The Department Chair will designate a chairperson for the search committee.
In consultation with the Department Chair and Dean’s Office, the search committee will produce a draft position description and job advertisement and present them to the department for discussion and approval and to the Dean and University administration for final approval.
Search committee members and the Department Chair will carefully follow policies and procedures of the College, Provost, Human Resources, and Equal Opportunity for faculty recruitment, with the overall goals of maximizing the diversity and quality of the applicant pool.
When the deadline for initial review arrives, the search committee will obtain a complete list of applicants and access to their complete applications. After evaluating all application files and consulting with University administration to ensure that other procedural requirements have been met, the search committee will compose a list of between nine and twelve candidates for screening interviews. The committee will make this interview list available to voting members of the department, who will be given access to all application materials so they can provide feedback to the committee on these choices.
Once the search committee has secured permission from the appropriate University offices to interview these candidates, the Department Chair will solicit a vote by eligible members of the department to approve the interview list. This vote may be conducted electronically.
After screening interviews and thoughtful deliberation, the search committee will typically select three candidates to invite to campus, and will provide at least two names as ranked alternates. The search committee chair will secure permission from the appropriate University offices to invite those candidates to campus. At this point, the search committee chair will inform all candidates that invitations for on-campus interviews have been made.
After all candidates have visited campus, the search committee will compose a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the finalists. The graduate student representative on the search committee will survey graduate students about their response to the candidates and submit this summary to include in the committee report. If the search committee can reach a consensus on ranking the finalists, it may include a suggested ranking in its report, or it can leave the finalists unranked. This report will be made available to faculty eligible for voting on hiring in advance of the meeting to discuss candidates, unless the department agrees by majority vote to waive the two-business-day rule. To help ensure confidentiality, this report will be made available in paper form and kept in the administrative associate’s office.
The Department Chair will call a departmental meeting to discuss the candidates and recommend appointments to the College. The meeting will begin with the search committee chair’s summary of the committee report. Student and external representatives are encouraged to participate in the initial discussion that follows the search committee’s report, but are not allowed to vote and should vacate the room during general discussion by faculty entitled to vote on personnel matters.
Voting procedure: If there are more than two finalist candidates, voting will proceed similarly to the procedure for electing a Department Chair. After the Department Chair closes discussion, each member entitled to vote on personnel decisions will receive a series of ballots with all finalist names. Faculty members must attend the meeting in person or via the procedure for virtual attendance to be eligible to vote.
Each voting member will vote for their ONE favored candidate and designate any candidate they consider “unacceptable.”
Any candidate deemed unacceptable by the majority of voters at any point will be designated unacceptable by the department.
If no candidate receives a majority on the ballot, the lowest vote recipient will be eliminated from consideration on the subsequent ballot. Voting will continue until a majority agrees on a top-ranked candidate.
This procedure will be repeated for ranking the remaining finalists until all finalists are ranked.
In the case of a persistent tie, the search committee chair will rank the tied candidates (in this specific situation, giving the search committee chair a double vote).
The ranking that results from this vote and the list of strengths and weaknesses produced by the search committee (modified as appropriate after meeting discussion) will provide the principal basis for the department’s recommendation for appointment to the Dean and other University administration.
After ranking is completed, the search committee chair will inform the student search representative of this outcome, so that the representative can inform other interested students, taking care to protect the confidentiality of the outcome and process. Once University administration formally approves that an offer of appointment can be made to a candidate, the search committee chair will inform in a timely manner all candidates for the position that an official offer of appointment has been made. When an offer of appointment is formally accepted by a candidate and approved by the University, the Department Chair will inform members of the department and the search committee chair will inform all applicants of the conclusion of the search.
Teaching professors are appointed to three-year, renewable positions. They are eligible for promotion after six years as described in an appendix. They are not eligible for tenure, but their appointments are envisioned as continuing provided that their performance meets or exceeds expectations and the budget permits. They have voting rights on a par with regular faculty, but may not vote on promotion and tenure cases for tenure-track faculty. Annual Evaluation of teaching professors follows procedures similar to those of tenure-track faculty as described in an appendix. They may be appointed through a competitive search, in which case the search procedure should follow that of tenure-track faculty.
The Department of History will make a concerted effort to recruit faculty from underrepresented groups by recommending direct hires and to retain faculty within our department and in other units via domestic partner accommodations. Procedures for domestic partner accommodations and other direct hires are governed by policies of the College and Provost. See, for example, http://policy.ku.edu/CLAS/domestic- partner-accommodation and http://diversity.ku.edu/langston-hughes-visiting- professors.
The direct appointment of teaching professors and any other tenure-track faculty hires is governed by the following procedure, if it does not involve a competitive search:
Once the Dean authorizes consideration of a prospective hire to move forward, the Chairperson or designated faculty will present their credentials to the department for consideration. If a majority of a quorum of those with the right to vote on personnel matters approves, consideration of this new hire will move on to a formal interview. Such a vote can be done electronically or in a departmental meeting.
At a minimum, a formal interview will involve sharing a portfolio demonstrating the candidate’s accomplishments and potential in research, teaching, and service and a public presentation to the department demonstrating one or more of these capabilities.
After completion of the interview process, the Department Chair will present a report summarizing the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses to a meeting of the department. After discussion, eligible faculty will vote to approve or disapprove of the candidate’s hire. This report and vote will provide the basis for the department’s recommendation for appointment to the Dean and other University administration.
Retired colleagues who have been relieved of departmental obligations and advanced to the rank of Professor Emeritus have not relinquished many of the rights and privileges that accompany membership in the department. The department will work to ensure that they will continue to enjoy such benefits as they care to utilize. These include, but are not limited to, a departmental mailbox, mailing privileges, use of departmental stationery and other office supplies, and secretarial assistance. They are eligible for office space as departmental availability permits, and may continue to advise students and offer such courses as University rules and departmental needs allow. Their participation in departmental meetings and other departmental activities will be welcomed, albeit without a voting role. All of this entails no obligation on their part, but merely represents the department’s desire to recognize that retirement should not diminish the fellowship they enjoy, in the conviction that Professor Emeritus is a highly esteemed academic rank which deserves respect and consideration.
The Department Chair may appoint qualified individuals as unpaid research associates or adjunct faculty, as permitted by University rules.
Faculty members who do not hold appointments in the Department of History but whose research and/or teaching is historical in nature may be appointed as courtesy members of the department.
The chairperson may make courtesy appointments based on the recommendation of departmental faculty or when approached directly by a prospective appointee. Such appointments are subject to approval by University administration.
Courtesy faculty are encouraged to participate in departmental programs, but do not hold voting rights within the department.
Appointment of lecturers, visiting professors, assistant instructors, and other paid non-tenure- track appointments (with the exception of teaching professors) will be made by the Chairperson, who will do so in consultation with Department Officers and Subject Area Caucuses, especially in the case of full-time and multi-year appointments. The Associate Chair is primarily responsible for supervising these appointments.
The Department Chair is responsible for the hiring, assignment of duties, supervision, and evaluation of all support staff assigned to the department.
A. Each faculty member with FTE in the department will serve on one and only one of the following three Regular Committees during an academic year: Undergraduate, Graduate, and Personnel. The existence of these committees will not preclude the formation of ad hoc committees by the Chair or other departmental members to meet special needs.
B. At the end of the academic year (or as circumstances require), the Personnel Committee will make recommendations to the Department Chair regarding the appointment of faculty to Regular Committees to ensure that all committees have a balanced membership appropriate to their responsibilities and in the best interests of the department. Faculty committee assignments, whenever possible, should be no less than two years and no more than four (excluding ex oficio service).
C. Joint appointments: Faculty with 0.5 or less FTE in the department will be appointed to a Regular Committee, but with the exception of the Personnel Committee, they will be expected to provide less service, such as serving for only one semester during a calendar year, given their obligations to other departments. The details of their service will be negotiated among the faculty member, the committee chair, and the Department Chair.
A. Students are entitled to be represented on all policy-making and search committees within the department at less than or equal to 20 percent of the faculty representation, and they are considered full voting members of departmental committees, unless specifically delimited by departmental bylaws. For example, student representatives are not involved in matters relating to faculty or student evaluation, and thus do not serve on the Personnel Committee. Students may serve in a representative capacity on a committee with fewer than four faculty members, but do so in an advisory capacity without a vote.
B. A graduate student shall be represented on the Graduate Committee. An undergraduate shall be represented on the Undergraduate Committee. Either graduate or undergraduate students may serve on the departmental committees other than the Personnel Committee. Students will not be represented on the Personnel Committee and shall not take part in any discussion or voting on personnel matters, including evaluation of sabbatical applications, misconduct deliberations, requests for travel/research funding, promotion and tenure committees, graduate admissions, or any matters that the Committee chair deems of a confidential nature. Student participation in changes to requirements in the undergraduate or graduate curriculum will be of an advisory nature, and without a vote in the matter. The participation of student representatives in faculty searches is discussed in the section on Faculty Appointments.
C. Selection: At the start of each academic year, the Director of Graduate Studies will initiate the process of selecting student representatives by distributing a call for nominations to all eligible students that includes this section of the bylaws. Faculty, student leaders, and interested students themselves are encouraged to nominate prospective representatives. The History Graduate Student Organization (HGSO) will annually select the graduate student representatives to the permanent committees and fill any vacancies that may occur. The Department Chair will select the undergraduate representatives to the standing committees, in consultation with the Undergraduate Director.
D. Expectations: Student representatives provide a vital service to the department. They are expected to attend all meetings of the committees to which they are assigned and to help fulfill the duties of these committees as described in their respective sections of departmental bylaws. It is important for student representatives to consult regularly with one another and with other students generally so that they can be effective representatives of the diversity of student interests and perspectives where departmental policies and activities are concerned. Student representatives will sometimes be involved in discussions of a confidential nature. It is important for students to protect this confidentiality and to ask faculty for advice on how to do so, as needed.
A. The chair will be appointed by the Department Chair and be designated as Director of Undergraduate Studies. The Director oversees the completion of the Undergraduate Committee’s tasks, delegates responsibilities to members of the Committee, and makes reports to the Department Chair and department as a whole.
B. Membership: The Undergraduate Committee will have no fewer than five members from among the regular faculty and teaching professors.
Curricula: Provide feedback on proposals for undergraduate courses. Review existing curricula and, as needed, suggest curricular changes to the department as a whole.

Awards and Scholarships: Present a call for nominations and applications for available undergraduate scholarships and awards and make recommendations to the Chair for the disbursement of such scholarships and awards to eligible students.
Undergraduate Research: Promote the research activities of undergraduate students, including advising the Chair on the expenditure of departmental funds to assist students in their research and to encourage faculty-undergraduate research collaboration.
Study abroad: Evaluate study abroad courses for History credit. Assist Study Abroad & Global Engagementin managing these aspects of the undergraduate major and minor.
Transfer course credit: In consultation with College and University student advisors, determine the appropriate awarding of credit for courses students have taken at other institutions.
All other duties and responsibilities for maintaining the integrity and proper functioning of the undergraduate program that are not specified above.
D. Student representation: Student representatives have an advisory but not a voting role in the determination of curricular requirements.
A. The chair will be appointed by the Department Chair and be designated as Director of Graduate Studies. The Director oversees the completion of the Graduate Committee’s tasks, delegates responsibilities to members of the Committee, and makes reports to the Department Chair and department as a whole.
B. Membership: The Undergraduate Committee will have no fewer than five members from among the regular faculty and teaching professors.
Curricula: Provide feedback on proposals for graduate courses. Reviews existing curricula and, as needed, suggest curricular changes to the department as a whole.

All other duties and responsibilities for maintaining the integrity and proper functioning of the graduate program that are not specified above.
D. Student representation: Student representatives have an advisory but not a voting role in the determination of curricular requirements. Student representatives do not participate in graduate admissions or deliberations on the granting of travel/research funding requests.
The Personnel Committee consists of five members chosen from among regular faculty and teaching professors:  three members selected from among regular faculty and teaching professors, who are elected by faculty vote for three-year terms, and two members appointed by the chair. It must include faculty from at least two different ranks or classifications. The following are ineligible: Department Chair, Associate Chair, Graduate Director, and Undergraduate Director; faculty on leave during all or part of the subsequent academic year; individuals who have served a full term within the past three years; persons not evaluated by the Personnel Committee; and individuals with an active Improvement Plan. The individual with the most years served will coordinate the duties and meetings of the Personnel Committee as its chairperson. In the case where there is no one with clear seniority on the Personnel Committee, members will choose their own chair. The chair oversees completion of Personnel Committee tasks, delegates responsibilities to members of the Committee, and makes reports to the Department Chair and department as a whole.  At least two members of the Personnel Committee must hold the rank of full professor.
Board elections are staggered, so that each year one new member is added to the Personnel Committee. Before the end of spring semester each year, the Department Chair distributes a list of individuals eligible for election to the Personnel Committee to all members of the department eligible to vote on personnel matters. From this list, each voter should select up to five individuals for election; rank them from one (highest preference) to five (lowest preference); and turn in this ranking for tabulation to the department’s administrative associate who will maintain their confidentiality. One point will be allocated for each first-place vote; 1/2 point for each second-place vote; 1/3 point for each third-place vote; 1/4 point for each fourth-place vote; and 1/5 point for each fifth-place vote. Subject to provisions requiring committee membership to include faculty from at least two different ranks or classifications, the Chair will appoint the individual with the highest point total. Individuals with the second- and third-highest point totals will be the second and third alternates, and so forth for ranking additional alternates. In case of a tie, the Chair will choose between the tied candidates, while making an effort to keep the committee diverse.
1. Annual Evaluations: The Personnel Committee administers Annual Faculty Evaluation and makes recommendations to the Chairperson on matters relevant to the annual evaluation, including Post-tenure Review and the allocation of merit salary increases, as stipulated in appendices.
a. Members of the Personnel Committee who are applying for sabbatical leave are ineligible to evaluate applications. If fewer than three members remain to perform this task, the Department Chair will appoint additional temporary members for this purpose. Student representatives do not participate in these evaluations.
b. At a time stipulated by the Personnel Committee, typically three weeks before the College deadline for submission, faculty applying for sabbatical will provide a complete copy of their application to the Governance Committee for review.
c. The Personnel Committee will review these applications, provide a concise formal assessment to the applicant and the Department Chair, and informally suggest improvements to each applicant.
d. The Committee will rank these applications, as required by the College, and this ranking will be forwarded along with the final applications.
e. At a time stipulated by the Personnel Committee, typically one week before the College deadline for submission, applicants may submit a revised application to the Department Chair for endorsement, otherwise the initial submission will be forwarded to the College.
a. Untenured members of the Personnel Committee are ineligible to participate. If fewer than three members remain to perform this task, the Department Chair will appoint additional temporary members for this purpose. Student representatives do not participate in these evaluations.
b. At a time stipulated by the Department Chair and University administration, the Personnel Committee members will evaluate a dossier on research, teaching, and service for each faculty member required to undergo Progress Toward Tenure Review, following procedures described in the appendix on PTTR.
5. Committee Appointments: The Personnel Committee appoints individuals to departmental committees as stipulated in sections above.
6. Review and oversight of departmental operations: The Personnel Committee will review the policies and actions of the Department Chair, Department Officers, other departmental committees, and their respective chairs and members as described in the section below. When appropriate, the Personnel Committee also advises the Dean on the Department Chair’s performance.
7.  The Personnel Committee advises the Department Chair and other members of the department on general policy and procedures within the department, both official and customary.
8. Bylaws: Maintain bylaws that authorize and regularize important departmental policies and procedures and that are consistent with College and University policies. All proposed changes must be approved by the process stipulated in the section below on Amendments to Bylaws.
9. Policy Changes: Monitor changes in policy of the College, Provost, Faculty Senate, University Senate, and Kansas Board of Regents. Report to the department on significant developments and institute changes to department bylaws and customary procedure as necessary.
10. Other Reports: The Governance Committee may also be charged by the Department Chair with composing other reports and self-studies, for example, in association with External Review.
11. Grievances: Handle formal grievance proceedings and make recommendations to the Department Chair regarding their outcome (see appendix).
12. All other duties and responsibilities for maintaining the integrity and proper functioning of departmental governance and procedure not specified above.
Subject-area caucuses exist to advise the Chair and Department Officers on practical and strategic matters regarding staffing, course scheduling, curricular requirements, graduate reading lists, and other issues related to specific regional, thematic, and temporal areas of inquiry. There are two official caucuses: United States history and world history, and there can be any number of informal caucuses made up of two or more faculty with shared subject interests. Official caucuses should select their own faculty spokesperson and student representative each year. Faculty can be members of any number of caucuses, official or informal, in which they have a clear interest. Subject Area Caucuses are considered active if member faculty meet as a group at least once per year to discuss course scheduling, graduate student reading lists, or other matters.
A. No committee, board, or officer of the department shall attempt to determine in any way the decisions that department members make about their subjects for future research. The intent here is to limit assessments and evaluation to the products of research effort.
B. Any policy or practice promulgated by a departmental committee or its respective chair will be subject to formal review by the department when at least five voting members of the department submit a written statement to the chair of the Personnel Committee describing the need for such a review. The Personnel chairperson will present and moderate discussion of the review at a departmental meeting. When appropriate, this review and discussion will then be communicated to the Dean or other University administration for further action. When appropriate, the Personnel Committee also advises the Dean on the Department Chair’s performance.
C. Faculty who are dissatisfied with the Personnel Committee's actions and decisions regarding Annual Performance Evaluations should consult the department’s Faculty Evaluation Plan (see appendix for procedures). Issues related to any other policy or practice promulgated by the Personnel Committee or its chair will be subject to formal review by the department when at least five voting members of the department submit a written statement describing the need for such a review to the Department Chair. The Department Chair will present and moderate discussion of the review at a departmental meeting. When appropriate, this review and discussion will then be communicated to the Dean or other University administration for further action.
A. The normal teaching load of full-time faculty is four courses per year, with the exception of teaching professors and faculty with temporary or permanent Differential Allocations of Effort. Faculty members’ teaching profiles should reflect an appropriate mix of courses at different levels that satisfy the department’s teaching responsibilities in regard to its undergraduate major, graduate program, and the KU Core Curriculum.
B. Per College policy, undergraduate courses normally must enroll at least 12 students and graduate courses at least 6 students, except as authorized by the Department Chair in order to satisfy the department’s curricular needs.
C. Team-Taught and Non-Departmental Courses: A faculty member may count participation in a team-taught course as the equivalent of serving as the sole instructor of a course if they normally attend all sessions of the course and participate fully in the planning of the course, selecting the textbooks, constructing the syllabus and schedule, preparing and grading all examinations, and assigning final grades; or if they are designated as the primary course coordinator with principal responsibility for all aspects of the course. When appropriate, assessment of load will be expressed in fractional terms (one-third, one-half, three-fourths, etc.) to reflect an estimate of each faculty member’s participation. Normally, courses taught outside the department (without a History listing) will be taught as an overload. Exceptions will be made after consultation and agreement between individual faculty members and the Department Chair.
D. Undergraduate Advising and Mentoring: The History Department faculty is collectively responsible for ensuring that our undergraduate students receive appropriate advising. To that end, each faculty member has the following responsibilities:
Cooperating with the staff academic advisor assigned by the College to the department in providing guidance to students in their fulfillment of major, minor, and Core requirements.
Providing information about their courses so that students can make informed decisions when selecting them.
Being available for consultation with students regularly in the department and/or electronically, preferably for three regularly scheduled hours each week that school is in session.
E. Graduate Advising and Mentoring: Although a specific faculty member typically takes primary responsibility for advising a graduate student, the History Department faculty is collectively responsible for ensuring that our graduate students receive appropriate advice and mentoring. To that end,
Primary advisors of graduate students are responsible, in collaboration with the Graduate Director and the graduate program administrative associate, for tracking their advisees’ progress, and for intervening when graduate students do not make expected progress.
Members of graduate students’ committees are responsible for providing responses to student questions and for reviewing students’ written work in a timely manner.
Faculty members should make themselves available for consultation with graduate students regularly in the department and/or electronically, preferably for three regularly scheduled hours each week that school is in session.
Faculty members should refer graduate students encountering difficulties to the appropriate University offices.
Faculty members have a responsibility for mentoring their graduate students in professional development and career preparation.
F. Scheduling: The equitable distribution of teaching assignments is the responsibility of the Associate Chair, in consultation with the Department Chair, Directors of Graduate and Undergraduate Studies, and Subject Area Caucuses. Faculty in this section is understood to include teaching professors and lecturers with multi-year appointments. The following procedures should be utilized:
Early in fall semester, the Associate Chair, in consultation with the Undergraduate Director, will inform faculty of anticipated undergraduate teaching needs. The Associate Chair will solicit from faculty members their proposals of courses to teach in the fall and spring semesters of the following academic year, along with preferences for time, format, and size of enrollment. Faculty members are advised to consult with Subject Area Caucuses to which they belong and faculty who teach the same or related courses before submitting requests. As a part of this, faculty should also share tentative, long-term plans for rotating through courses in subsequent years.
Early in fall semester, the Graduate Director, in consultation with the Graduate Committee and Subject Area Caucuses, will solicit proposals from faculty to teach graduate classes for the following year. Such requests should include a justification for the course, including any students from outside the department who might be served by the course. When recommending a slate of graduate courses for scheduling to the Associate Chair, the Graduate Committee will consider the number of students likely to enroll and the equitable distribution of those courses across subject areas.
In consultation with the Undergraduate and Graduate Directors, the Associate Chair will review faculty preferences for teaching in light of the department’s needs and assign courses accordingly. If a particular faculty member’s preference cannot be sustained, the Associate Chair will endeavor to identify a substitute course that answers both to the department’s needs and the faculty member’s wishes. If faculty members have particular preferences concerning the format, size, days and times their courses are offered, they may express those preferences to the Associate Chair. However, the Associate Chair, acting for the Department Chair, has the final authority to assign teaching schedules.
If the Associate Chair, Graduate and/or Undergraduate Directors identify a teaching need that faculty are unable to fill or that might desirably be taught by an advanced graduate student as an Assistant Instructor to bolster their teaching credentials, they will consult with each other and the Department Chair concerning options for staffing those courses. If a limited-term lecturer is to be hired, the Department Chair will make the appointment.
When a current graduate student is assigned as the sole instructor for a course (i.e. Assistant Instructor), they must identify a teaching mentor from among the departmental faculty before the beginning of the semester. The teaching mentor will advise the Assistant Instructor concerning course design, syllabus preparation, assignments, and assessments throughout the semester. In addition, the teaching mentor will visit the class (in person or online), and is responsible for writing an evaluation of the Assistant Instructor’s performance at the end of the semester.
Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) assignments: The Associate Chair will determine which courses should have GTAs assigned to them to assist instructors of record and inform the Graduate Director. The Graduate Director will then assign GTAs to these courses, taking into consideration the stated preference of graduate students and instructors of record when practical. GTAs and faculty members who prefer to be assigned together to particular courses may tell the Graduate Director, but the Graduate Director and the Associate Chair are empowered to make assignments in accord with the needs of the department.
If faculty or graduate students experience situational changes, such as fellowship leave or course reductions, that require changes in their future teaching schedule, they should inform the Associate Chair and Graduate Director immediately.
The Associate Chair will track advance enrollments in courses. When advance enrollments indicate that a course is unlikely to fill to the College minimum, the Associate Chair is empowered to cancel the course and reassign the faculty member to other instructional responsibilities. The Associate Chair will consult with the faculty members affected, but the Associate Chair, acting for the Department Chair, has the final say on teaching assignments. The Associate Chair may also reassign GTAs, Assistant Instructors, and limited-term lecturers based on course enrollments.
Summer Term and Winter Intercession Courses: Faculty members or advanced graduate students who would like to teach Summer Term or Winter Intercession courses should respond to the call for proposals for the next upcoming terms that is circulated by the Department Chair early in the fall semester. Proposals must demonstrate the likelihood that the course in question will meet minimum enrollment requirements. Courses that do not enroll sufficiently will be cancelled.
Study Abroad Courses: Faculty members may propose Study Abroad courses, but they are responsible for making all arrangements with Study Abroad & Global Engagement and for supplying all information in a timely manner to the Department Chair necessary for making application to the College for funding.
The department recognizes the need to maintain a complete and accurate record of each faculty member’s activities, while protecting the confidentiality of certain categories of information and limiting access to other categories of information. Therefore, the department’s administrative associate maintains a file documenting each faculty member’s professional activities. The Confidentiality of Personnel Records is governed by Faculty Senate Rules and Regulations (FSSR), Article VII, section 2, available at https://policy.ku.edu/governance/FSRR#art7sect2, and by the Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, Article III, section 5, available at https://policy.ku.edu/FacultyCodeKULawrence/faculty-code-of-rights#III.
Files concerning faculty members must be treated as confidential, and as such are available only to those administrators and committees who have direct responsibility for decisions concerning them. Within the History Department, the Department Chair, the Associate Chair, and the Personnel Committee may access materials in faculty files as necessary for fulfillment of their responsibilities. The department’s administrative associates may access the files for the purpose of maintaining them.
Files connected with faculty member applications for Progress Towards Tenure Review, Promotion and Tenure, and Post-Tenure Review are kept separate from other file materials. These files may be accessed only in connection with these processes by persons authorized to participate in these processes. Subsequent to the conclusion of these processes, these files may only be accessed by authorized persons in strict accordance with University rules and Kansas Open Records laws.
A faculty member may access their own personnel file upon request. A faculty member who wants to access their file will direct this request to the Department Chair. The Department Chair will remove from the file those items, such as letters of recommendation, that were provided to the department upon a pledge of confidentiality. The remainder of the file will be provided to the faculty member in a timely manner.
If, upon examination of their own file, a faculty member determines that information is incomplete or mistaken, they may notify the Department Chair, Dean, or other University administration of the inaccuracies and ask that the file be corrected.
Extraneous materials of an unofficial nature will not be retained in faculty members’ individual files.
According to the Faculty Code, Article III, section 6, faculty members have a right to keep their own offices and files, including computers and electronic files, secure from unlawful search and seizure. Faculty members also have the responsibility of compiling, preserving, and protecting the confidentiality of records they need to fulfill their professional responsibilities. This is particularly true of files relevant to student work, Progress Toward Tenure Review, Promotion and Tenure Review, Post-Tenure Review, and annual evaluations. Accordingly, faculty members should retain the following items:
The University of Kansas protects the privacy of its students’ records in compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and its implementing regulations. Therefore, faculty should take care to protect the privacy of students when maintaining these files. The department has secured bins for disposing of any paperwork that may be considered private, confidential, or sensitive. University Registrar policy covering the privacy of student records is available at: http://policy.ku.edu/registrar/student-record-policy.
Cases of academic misconduct by students in courses taught by the History Department will be handled according to the policies established by University Senate Rules and Regulations, Article II, section 6, available at: http://policy.ku.edu/governance/USRR#art2sect6.
Academic misconduct by a student shall include, but not be limited to, disruption of classes; threatening an instructor or fellow student in an academic setting; giving or receiving of unauthorized aid on examinations or in the preparation of notebooks, themes, reports or other assignments; knowingly misrepresenting the source of any academic work; unauthorized changing of grades; unauthorized use of University approvals or forging of signatures; falsification of research results; plagiarizing of another's work; violation of regulations or ethical codes for the treatment of human and animal subjects; or otherwise acting dishonestly in research.
Course instructors are required to report instances of academic misconduct. Therefore, faculty and other instructional staff should not handle suspected instances of academic misconduct in an informal manner, nor should they resolve them directly with the student.
When course instructors discover instances of suspected academic misconduct, they are required to act in a timely manner and should promptly compile the relevant documentation, including syllabus language relating to academic misconduct and its penalties, any course exercises to teach about plagiarism or other misconduct, assignment instructions, and all evidence of academic misconduct. If the student is an undergraduate, the course instructor will bring the evidence to the Undergraduate Director, who will initiate the process of charging the student with academic misconduct. If the student is a graduate student, the course instructor or academic advisor will bring the evidence to the Graduate Director, who will initiate the process of charging the student with academic misconduct. The course instructor may recommend a penalty, but resolution of this process will be handled by the Undergraduate or Graduate Committee.
A. A student who objects to the final grade received in a History Department course, alleging improper application of course grading criteria and procedures should first seek redress directly with the course instructor. If the student is dissatisfied with the outcome at that point, they may file a grievance through the History Department’s Grievance Policy. If the student is dissatisfied with the outcome at that point, they may appeal to the Judicial Board of the University, per University Senate Rules and Regulations 2.3.5 and 6.4.4.
B. A student who objects to the final grade received in a History Department course alleging discrimination or other misconduct on the part of the instructor should file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX, per University Senate Rules and Regulations 6.4.5.
A. Amendments to the bylaws must be adopted at a regular meeting of the department by majority vote. Amendments may be proposed by any member or standing committee of the department. Amendments must be distributed in writing at least one week before the meeting at which they are to be considered.
B. At the request of two voting members present at any regular departmental meeting at which amendments are being considered, these amendments must be submitted to an email ballot in which all eligible voting members of the department will have the opportunity to vote.

PolicyPurpose: To establish the requirement that every University of Kansas course must have a syllabus on file with the University and to articulate the required and recommended information to be included within all syllabi.
Campus: EdwardsLawrenceJuniper GardensParsonsSalinaTopekaWichitaYoderMedical Center, Kansas CityTable of Contents: I. Required Elements
A syllabus outlines the academic relationship between instructors and students in a course. Used as the basis for communication and accountability, a syllabus conveys course expectations, organizes required information, sets the tone for the learning environment, and assists students in navigating the course. A syllabus helps document and clarify essential information, such as course goals, learning objectives, evaluation and grading standards, key dates and assignments, and expectations for student and instructor behavior.
For every credit-bearing course at the University of Kansas, the Instructor of Record (hereafter Instructor) is required to create a course syllabus that includes, at minimum, the required elements defined in this policy. The Instructor must (1) provide the syllabus (either as a hard copy or online) to every student enrolled in the course by the end of the first class session, and (2) must submit an electronic copy of the course syllabus to the appropriate campus [i.e., the KU Lawrence and reporting campuses (KULC) or KU Medical Center and reporting campuses (KUMC)] syllabus repository by the tenth day of the semester.
Course requirements [e.g., extracurricular activities, exams, quizzes, assignments, field trips (see KULC: Field Trips Policy)]
For all KULC KU Core Curriculum-certified courses, the syllabus must clearly state that status and must articulate the KU Core learning goal(s) covered in the course and certified through the University Core Curriculum Committee (UCCC)
Semester (start and end dates need to be designated if course timeframe falls outside traditional Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters)
Course instructional mode [e.g., in-person class, hybrid classroom class, hybrid online class, online class (see Instruction Mode Help Sheet)]
KUMC: School of Health Professions Attendance; School of Nursing Attendance; School of Medicine (MD) Attendance; and Graduate Studies Attendance
If a proctored or online exam is given for an online course, the due date and any cost to the student shall be noted in the course syllabus
The following required information must be referenced or directly on the syllabus [see the University Syllabus Boilerplate Language and Resource Guide for recommended language and other resources].
Explanation of instructional time expected for out-of-class student work per credit (see Credit Hour Definition policy)
KUMC: School of Health Professions Grade Policy; School of Nursing Grade Policy; School of Medicine (MD) Grade Policy; and Graduate Studies Grade Policies
In addition to the required elements defined in this policy, Instructors are encouraged to add, as appropriate, the following information to any syllabus shared with a student(s).
Instructors are encouraged to clearly communicate their expectations related to academic misconduct, plagiarism, and the use of external assistance or work (i.e., group work, non-KU tutoring, artificial intelligence)
Statement that information listed on the syllabus may be subject to change, including how the Instructor will communicate changes to students and document such modifications
Instructors are encouraged to include on the syllabus any other pertinent information that students should be informed of at the beginning of the course and to update the syllabus as needed.
Instructors are encouraged to clearly communicate and document any subsequent changes to their course syllabi.
Exclusions or Special Circumstances: Course syllabi may be subject to additional programmatic accreditation requirements not defined in this policy.
Courses corresponding to masters' thesis, dissertation, practicum, and research hours are not subject to this policy.
Non-credit-bearing courses are not subject to this policy; however, Instructors of such courses are encouraged to use the principles of this policy to ensure students have the information needed to be successful.
Consequences: Instructors who do not comply with this policy are subject to the disciplinary, grievance, and appeal procedures of their unit.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from treating any applicant, employee, or faculty member unfavorably with respect to the terms, conditions and privileges of employment because of such individual's sex.  Title VII also prohibits unwelcome conduct, based on sex, that is so severe and pervasive that it substantially interferes with a person's ability to perform their duties or that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities.  Under Title IX, sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, sexual violence and sexual coercion.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Jeanne Clery Act, expands the requirement of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment:  “Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Hostile Environment Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to,:
unwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;
unwelcome commentary about an individual's body or sexual activities;
threatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;
engaging in indecent exposure, voyeurism, or other invasions of personal privacy;
unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature based upon sex stereotypes, including sex stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.
Sexual Violence: "Sexual Violence" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g. due to the person's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent).  Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion.
The University Sexual Harassment Policy, as well as the University Non-discrimination Policy, prohibit gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature. For further information regarding the University's process for reporting and investigating Sexual Harassment or Sexual Violence, click on the Title IX or Complaint Resolution Process tabs at the top.

In the landmark decision, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 140 S.Ct. 1731 (2020), the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects gay and transgender workers from workplace discrimination.
Sexual orientation is the preferred term used to describe a pattern of emotional, romantic and sexual attraction to another person.
Homosexuality is defined as the romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. Transgender generally refers to an individual whose gender identity differs from the sex the person was identified as having at birth.
Sexual orientation discrimination involves adverse treatment of a person (an applicant, employee, or student) because of that person's sexual orientation (gay, lesbian, bisexual); because that person is perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual; or because that person is associated with persons who are gay, lesbian or bisexual.
If you believe you have been subjected to sexual orientation discrimination or have witnessed sexual orientation discrimination, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at civilrights@ku.edu or file a report online.

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual violence against anyone participating in education programs and activities.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Clery Act, expands the requirement of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) prohibits sexual violence against all people and provides guidelines on how universities should respond if victims of sexual violence disclose themselves to universities and colleges.
Sexual violence: "Sexual Violence" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g. due to the person's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent). Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion. Sexual violence can occur between strangers or acquaintances, including people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Sexual violence can be committed by men or by women, and it can occur between people of the same or different sex.
Sexual violence is a broad term and includes various forms of sexual misconduct, including but not limited to:
the deliberate touching of a person's intimate parts (including genitalia, groin, breast or buttocks, or clothing covering any of those areas);
using force to cause a person to touch their own or another person's intimate parts; penetration (anal, oral or vaginal) by a penis, tongue, finger, or an inanimate object;
taking sexual advantage of another person without consent, including causing or attempting to cause the incapacitation of another person;
distributing intimate or sexual information about another person;
knowingly transmitting a sexually transmitted infection, including HIV, to another person; and/or
capturing or transmitting intimate or sexual utterances, sounds or images of another person.
Title IX and University Policy prohibit sex-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature.
The University Sexual Harassment Policy also prohibits sexual violence, including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual exploitation and stalking. If you have been subjected to sexual violence or have witnessed sexual violence, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at civilrights@ku.edu, or file a report online.
If you have been a victim of sexual violence follow these four steps:
Call someone you trust such as a friend or family member.
Seek medical attention to ensure your well-being as well as to have forensic evidence collected.
Give yourself time to heal, you are a survivor and what happened to you was not your fault
Here is a list of safe organizations for individuals who have encountered sexual violence. These organizations can help with medical attention, filing a report, and the healing process:

Sexual Harassment: “Sexual Harassment” is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment: “Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment” is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment: “Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment may include, but is not limited to:
Unwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;
Unwelcome commentary about an individual’s body or sexual activities;
Threatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;
Engaging in indecent exposure; voyeurism, or other invasion of personal privacy;
Unwelcome physical touching or closeness that does not rise to the level of Sexual Assault; and
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a manner that does not interfere with First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employee’s official duties.  Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employee’s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive.  In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
Penetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.  An “object” or “instrument” is anything used by the offender other than the offender’s genitalia.
Touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Domestic Violence: “Domestic Violence”  is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.
Dating Violence: “Dating Violence” is violence committed by a person –
Who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and
Where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
Stalking: “Stalking” is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.  For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:
(A) Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property.
(B) Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.
(C) Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.
1The University’s definition of “Sexual Assault” is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  Those regulations require the University to adopt a definition of “Sexual Assault” that incorporates various forcible and non-forcible sex crimes as defined by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting System.  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.30(a).

Addressing Sexual and Relationship Violence: A Trauma-Informed Approach
This toolkit describes a public health model of trauma-informed care and provides guidance on engaging all campus constituents in creating a trauma-informed campus. The toolkit provides institutions of higher education with a comprehensive, meaningful resource to utilize when developing prevention programming as well as response to incidents of sexual violence experienced by members of the campus community.
Developed using best practices, current research, and resources from key organizations,
including The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network
(NCTSN), ACHA’s toolkit recommends a trauma-informed framework to better address the
impact sexual violence has on campus community members.
Campus sexual and relationship violence are serious public health issues adversely affecting college and university students because students cannot learn in an atmosphere in which they do not feel safe. In its 2016 Position Statement on Sexual and Relationship Violence on College and University Campuses and in its guidelines, ACHA affirms that campuses have a responsibility and an opportunity to engage with emerging research; evaluate the efficacy of their own prevention, response, and treatment efforts; and actively share lessons learned. Trauma-informed approaches should be adopted across campus in order to provide a more sensitive response and lower the risk of re-victimization. Services, resources, and training should be congruent with best practices as they evolve.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from treating any applicant, employee, or faculty member unfavorably with respect to the terms, conditions and privileges of employment because of such individual's sex.  Title VII also prohibits unwelcome conduct, based on sex, that is so severe and pervasive that it substantially interferes with a person's ability to perform their duties or that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities.  Under Title IX, sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, sexual violence and sexual coercion.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Jeanne Clery Act, expands the requirement of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment:  “Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Hostile Environment Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to,:
unwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;
unwelcome commentary about an individual's body or sexual activities;
threatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;
engaging in indecent exposure, voyeurism, or other invasions of personal privacy;
unwelcome physical touching or closeness;
unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature based upon sex stereotypes, including sex stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.
Sexual Violence: "Sexual Violence" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g. due to the person's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent).  Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion.
The University Sexual Harassment Policy, as well as the University Non-discrimination Policy, prohibit gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature. For further information regarding the University's process for reporting and investigating Sexual Harassment or Sexual Violence, click on the Title IX or Complaint Resolution Process tabs at the top.
If you believe you have been subjected to sex discrimination or sexual harassment or have witnessed sex discrimination or harassment, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, University Title IX Coordinator at civilrights@ku.edu, or file an online report.

In the landmark decision, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 140 S.Ct. 1731 (2020), the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects gay and transgender workers from workplace discrimination.
Sexual orientation is the preferred term used to describe a pattern of emotional, romantic and sexual attraction to another person.
Homosexuality is defined as the romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. Transgender generally refers to an individual whose gender identity differs from the sex the person was identified as having at birth.
Sexual orientation discrimination involves adverse treatment of a person (an applicant, employee, or student) because of that person's sexual orientation (gay, lesbian, bisexual); because that person is perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual; or because that person is associated with persons who are gay, lesbian or bisexual.
If you believe you have been subjected to sexual orientation discrimination or have witnessed sexual orientation discrimination, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at civilrights@ku.edu or file a report online.

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual violence against anyone participating in education programs and activities.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Clery Act, expands the requirement of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) prohibits sexual violence against all people and provides guidelines on how universities should respond if victims of sexual violence disclose themselves to universities and colleges.
Sexual violence: "Sexual Violence" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g. due to the person's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent). Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion. Sexual violence can occur between strangers or acquaintances, including people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Sexual violence can be committed by men or by women, and it can occur between people of the same or different sex.
Sexual violence is a broad term and includes various forms of sexual misconduct, including but not limited to:
the deliberate touching of a person's intimate parts (including genitalia, groin, breast or buttocks, or clothing covering any of those areas);
using force to cause a person to touch their own or another person's intimate parts; penetration (anal, oral or vaginal) by a penis, tongue, finger, or an inanimate object;
taking sexual advantage of another person without consent, including causing or attempting to cause the incapacitation of another person;
causing the prostitution of another person;
allowing third parties to observe sexual acts;
distributing intimate or sexual information about another person;
knowingly transmitting a sexually transmitted infection, including HIV, to another person; and/or
capturing or transmitting intimate or sexual utterances, sounds or images of another person.
Title IX and University Policy prohibit sex-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature.
The University Sexual Harassment Policy also prohibits sexual violence, including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual exploitation and stalking. If you have been subjected to sexual violence or have witnessed sexual violence, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at civilrights@ku.edu, or file a report online.
If you have been a victim of sexual violence follow these four steps:
Call someone you trust such as a friend or family member.
Seek medical attention to ensure your well-being as well as to have forensic evidence collected.
Give yourself time to heal, you are a survivor and what happened to you was not your fault
