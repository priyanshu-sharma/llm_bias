Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity1. Title IX protects all members of our campus community who experience sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), stalking, or discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. These protections apply to students, faculty, staff, contractors, applicants and campus visitors. We are committed to creating and fostering a campus environment free from all forms of sex discrimination.Protection from Prohibited ConductProhibited conduct is a wide range of behavior including sexual harassment, sexual assault,  interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), and stalking. Additionally, the university's revised HOP 3-3031: Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex Discrimination prohibits sex discrimination, sexual exploitation, unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, retaliation, false information and false complaints, and interference with a grievance process under this policy.  The Title IX Office works to prevent prohibited conduct from occurring, and responds seriously and appropriately to all reports of prohibited conduct.Protection from Gender-based HarassmentTitle IX also prohibits gender-based harassment, which the Office for Civil Rights defines as "unwelcome conduct based on a student’s sex, harassing conduct based on a student’s failure to conform to sex stereotypes2." It includes "slurs, taunts, stereotypes, or name-calling, as well as gender-motivated physical threats, attacks, or other hateful conduct3."University policy protects against discrimination on the basis of sex, and our policies include protections for gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. If you feel you are being discriminated against based on your sex or gender, you have the right to report to the Title IX Office.Protection for Pregnant, Nursing, and Parenting StatusTitle IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including on the basis of pregnancy and parenting status. The university is required to provide reasonable accommodations due to pregnancy and parenting needs, including excused absences, changes in the work environment, or alternative participation options4.  If you feel that reasonable accommodations are not being provided, please visit our webpage or contact the Title IX Office.1 “Title IX and Sex Discrimination.” US Department of Education (ED).  www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html.2 “Sex-Based Harassment.” US Department of Education (ED). www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/pro-students/issues/sex-issue01.html.3 “What Is Sex-Based Harassment?” Sex Discrimination, US Department of Education (ED). www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/sex.html#sexhar1.4 “Know Your Rights: Pregnant or Parenting?

Title IX AdvisorsThe Title IX University Advisors are a pool of trained faculty and staff members who are available to assist and advise parties in all investigation tracks (Track A, B, C).In the 2020 Title IX Regulations, investigation outcomes must be determined at a live hearing, with live cross-examination. They further stipulated that cross-examinations at a live hearing must be conducted by an “advisor of choice” (advisor).  In the event that a party does not have an advisor, the university must provide an advisor to conduct cross-examination on behalf of that party. You are not required to have an Advisor for any portion of the Grievance Process, except for the live hearing in Track A or Track B of the Grievance Process. An Advisor can be a friend, family member, attorney, any person of your choosing. You are also not required to maintain the same Advisor for the entirety of the Grievance Process. To help fulfill the needs of the campus community, UT Austin has developed programs to provide advisors to parties engaging in the investigation process: Title IX University Advisors and the Pro Bono Program. You are also not required to utilize a university appointed Advisor. The Pro Bono Program is a partnership with the UT Law School. Advisors through the Pro Bono Program work in pairs to support their party. Advisors are supervised by a licensed attorney and only one may be allowed to serve as an advisor during the live hearing. If you are interested in applying to be a University Title IX Advisor or if you have questions prior to applying, please reach out to supportandresources@austin.utexas.edu.

Web Privacy Policy | IT@UT | | The University of Texas at Austin
How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
Open Records Requests and Other Sharing of Information
What rights do I have related to my personal information?
This document sets forth the Data Privacy Standards of the University of Texas at Austin (“University”) and provides information about the collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data provided to or otherwise collected or processed by the University.
The purpose of this policy is to establish a generally applicable University-wide data privacy standard and to provide interested persons with information about the University’s collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data regardless of the lawful bases under or legitimate purpose for which the information was obtained.  Subject to state and federal law, the University intends for this policy to be compliant with the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The Data Privacy Standard applies to all domains within the University Web and to any other University action or process concerning the collection, processing, analysis and other data processing of personal information regardless of the method by which such information came to be owned and/or controlled by the University.
The University, by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, “University Web”). While this policy applies across campus, some University websites may have additional policies and practices regarding privacy that also must be observed.  The University’s Data Protection Officer in consultation with the Chief Information Officer must approve any such “local” policies prior to the policy’s implementation.
The University’s Web may contain links to third party external websites over which the University has no control.  The University disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of external websites regardless of a link to such websites being displayed on the University Web.
For the purposes of the policy, “processing” means obtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data, including – organization, adaptation or alteration of the information or data, retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data, disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data.  A “data subject” is a phrase that refers to the person to whom the personal data relates.
Each University Web application or site shall contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
5. What is ‘personal information’ or ‘personal data’?
‘Personal information’ or ‘personal data’ means any information that relates to or identifies a person as an individual.
6. How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
The University obtains personal information when a person fills out and submits an application to attend or work at the University along with any additional information the person submits to the University before or after they submit an application.  Persons may also provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services.
In addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services, the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University.  As discussed elsewhere in this policy, some University Web (as well as third party’s) webpages use “cookies” to collect information about the web user.  University Web servers (“Web Server”) may also “collect” information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information:
Internet address (IP address) of computer being used
UIN (unique person identifier for EID-based services only)
The data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.
Individual data gathered through a specific process, such as the submission of an application to attend the University, related submissions, and subsequent interaction with admissions staff, will only be used for its intended purpose, such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision, or for certain archiving, research, or statistical purposes described below.  Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University.
The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes (“research purposes”).  Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible.  The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject.  The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes.
Further processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University.  Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University’s processes for human subject research, if applicable, and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects.
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited. For example, when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time the person visited the site, a cookie was probably set on their computer; when they return, the cookie is read again. A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed.
University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID. The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web. Normally, a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community. For example, students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.
Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.
Some pages within the utexas.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a utexas.edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party. Specifically, the following code within a utexas.edu page would represent an example of third party content:
<img src="/%3Ca%20href%3D"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" />
In this example, logo.gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas.edu domain (www.other-org.com in this case). Third party content in utexas.edu is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.
The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when a person visits utexas.edu pages that contain third party content, information, such as their IP address, date, browser, and requested page, is transmitted from your computer to that third party.
9. Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
The University processes personal data for a number of reasons, including to meet its contractual obligations, the legitimate conduct of its business operations, and to comply with applicable law.  Sometimes, consent will be the basis for processing personal data.  In these cases, the University will ask the data subject for consent to process their personal data and to share that data with third parties. The processing of personal data provided to the University by a data subject or from authorized third parties, like their high school or a national testing service, enables the University to identify the data subject; engage in processing an application or other submission to the University; or verify information already provided to the University.
The University may also use or disclose personal data for the following statutory or public interest purposes:  to prevent or detect fraud; to monitor equal opportunity; to better serve the needs of students with disabilities with reasonable accommodations; or for research and statistical purposes, the later purpose relying only on aggregate data.
Furthermore, the University processes personal data either necessary for the University to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with a person (e.g. to assess an offer of services to the University) or for the purposes of a legitimate interest of the University pursued by the University (e.g. equal opportunity monitoring).  The University requires persons to provide the University with certain information during the application process in order to assess their application properly except where providing personal information is marked as optional.  Neither admissions nor employment decisions are automated.
Some University Web websites use Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the user visits the site. This information is used to monitor the effectiveness of the website and to consider potential improvements to the website. The information is non-personal and is transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. The University does not share any specific information about a particular user.
Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics terms of use and Google's privacy practices. To opt out of Google’s data collection, read more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
11. Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information
The University does its best to ensure that the personal information it has is accurate. Users with a UT EID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address at UT Direct.
Although no computer system is 100% secure, the University has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.  See Information Resources Use and Security Policy https://security.utexas.edu/policies/irusp#standard12
The University has policies and procedures in place in case of a data breach or some other incident that places information held by the University in jeopardy.  Any individual who believes a data breach has occurred must immediately notify the Chief Information Security Officer, who will investigate the alleged breach and, if necessary, consult with the University’s Data Breach Response Planning Group and the affected department to remediate the breach, including providing any required notices.
Please see the two policies below for the University’s full data breach policies (UT EID Required).
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/incident-management-procedures
Personally Identifiable Data Breach Notification Plan
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/data-breach-notification-plan
In certain circumstances, the University may be required to provide notice to affected individuals or certain governing authorities if a data breach results in disclosure of personal data.
Several sites within the University Web enable users to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy to only use confidential information that a user enters during a transaction for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.
14. Open Records Requests and Other Sharing of Information
Except for educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or information made confidential by other law, all information provided to and collected from the University Web, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the University Web, and information collected from University Web-based forms, along with any other form or type of document or other instrument containing personal information, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.  Such information may also, in the legal context, be subject to discovery requests or other legal demand that personal data or information be released and made public.  The same is true for any personal information obtained by the University through other means such as written submission or communications with previous schools or employers.
The University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users.
As well as circulating application and related materials to the appropriate staff at the University and its various departments and colleges, the University will share personal information for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:
In the case of international applicants, the appropriate state and federal agencies;
Immigration authorities in order to act as a person’s sponsor for visa purposes;
Governmental bodies, including local authorities; the Teachers’ Retirement System; UT Workers Compensation; and other agencies or private actors, such as health care providers, that circumstances require be privy to certain personal information
Other Higher Education organizations, in order to assist with tracking and research into access to Higher Education; and
Companies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, the University and/or one or more of its component colleges, schools, department or programs.
Unless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act or otherwise compelled by lawful means, or as a party to a legal action, it is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the University Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences. For example, the University's portal, UT Direct, enables users to customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot be shared with external third parties, unless required by law.
Consistent with FERPA and other applicable privacy law, the University does not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless the University receives explicit written consent, is required to do so by law, or for other legitimate ends of the University.  University students can read more about directory information in the University's General Information Catalog. Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.
The University makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that users disclose in these areas becomes public information, so users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.
Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Canvas, may be logged. However, FERPA generally prohibits disclosure of these educational records.
The University is a research institution. At any time, the University is conducting numerous online surveys on the University Web. It is University policy only to use personal information gathered in these online surveys for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas Public Information Act or as otherwise compelled by law. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
The University will internally share the personal information it receives from applications and other information submitted to the University in accordance with the University’s policy and practice.  Various university staff and faculty may be involved in processing personal data for the purposes for which the University obtained the data.  In some instances, a third-party vendor employed by the University to assist in data processing might process personal data.  Data subjects have the right to be notified of such third party processing of their personal information.
For students, the University will use the details provided on their application, together with any supporting documents or other forms of information that an applicant may provide with their application.  For the purposes of this policy the “application” includes the online application, application fee, an essay, three short answer prompts, your high school transcripts, any college transcripts, test scores, major-specific items, resume, letters of recommendation (not required) and, if applicable, permanent residence card, student information form, course work form and residency affidavit. Different application forms may apply depending on citizen/residency status.
In addition to the application form, the University will use the details in a transcript from every senior college the applicant has attended.  Where the applicant seeks entry into the graduate Accounting and Nursing programs, University will make use of information from an applicants’ transcripts from all junior and/or community colleges attended as well as past test scores.  The individual graduate programs have additional requirements that may require the University to use additional materials.  The same applies to any letters of recommendation that are received.  The University may also rely on personal information that arises from student conduct investigations or hearings.
For faculty and staff, the University will process personal information received in an application for employment or through an interview as well as other means, formal and informal, and maintain records of employees.  For example, a faculty member may wish to participate in certain health care/insurance programs offered by third party vendors, who have a contract with the University to provide such things.  Enrollment in these programs may require sensitive date to be shared with the relevant third party, such as an insurance carrier.  The University will also make use of testing or evaluations to assess various aspects of faculty and staff performance.  Such information could arise as part of a grievance or disciplinary process.
19. What rights do I have related to my personal information?
Data subjects have the right to access the personal information that the University holds about them. Data subjects also have the right to ask the University to correct any inaccurate personal information the University holds about them.  In some cases, data subjects may request that the University delete personal information, request that the University restrict processing their personal information, or object to the University processing their personal information.
There are several laws, including FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) that give data subjects certain rights so far as it pertains to their personal information.
FERPA provides the right to correct one’s personal data and have access to personal information kept about them.  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
Also, as a general rule but subject to certain exceptions, schools must have written permission from the parent or adult student in order to release any part of the student’s education records.
HIPAA provides certain personal data rights to patients who receive healthcare services at covered entities.  The University is a hybrid entity, which means that certain departments at the University, including, but not limited to, University Health Services (“UHS”) and Dell Medical School, are subject to HIPAA.  Each University department that is subject to HIPAA will provide a Notice of Privacy Practices to patients detailing their rights under HIPAA, including their personal data rights.  For example, a data subject may find the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by UHS at the following link: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/privacypractices.pdf.
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives a person the right to be informed about the information that the University collects about them. It also gives a person the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the University correct any of that information that is wrong. Requests to receive and review any of that information, or request corrections to it, may be made by contacting the University's Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box 8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (email: cfo@www.utexas.edu).
The GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect May 25, 2018.  The GDPR’s intent is to regulate the gathering, use and maintenance of personally identifiable information about a natural person and providing certain rights to the data subject, such as the right to erasure and the right to object to the use of personal data.  This law applies to any person, citizen or not, who at the time of the data collection is located in the European Union.  It does not require an entity, like the University, to be located or acting within the EU for jurisdiction to attach; however, a non-EU entity like the University must process personal data related to the offering of goods or services in the EU or to the monitoring of a person’s behavior in the EU for jurisdiction to attach.
You have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information in accordance with all applicable laws. The erasure of your information will be subject to the retention periods of applicable federal and state law and the University’s Record Retention Schedule. If you have provided consent to the use of your information, you have the right to withdraw consent without affecting the lawfulness of the University's use of the information prior to receipt of your request.  A Data Subject may exercise their rights by contacting the University’s Data Protection Officer.
If you feel the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such information, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in the European Union.
The State of Texas and the United States also have laws that address privacy generally and the use of certain types of records, such as educational and health records (described above), that contain personally identifiable information.  Texas has laws that govern records retention and finally, under US/Texas law, the University may have good reason to keep the information despite a conflict with the GDPR.
As a general rule, in cases where Texas or Federal law conflict with the laws of other countries in regard to the processing, use or maintenance of a data subject’s personal information, including provisions of the GDPR, the University will treat Texas and Federal law as controlling.
University employees who receive a request by a Data Subject to have their data forgotten or who have other questions regarding the rights of Data Subjects provided by the GDPR should contact the University’s Data Protection Officer.
The University is an agency of the state of Texas and must follow a records retention schedule, which may be found at: https://financials.utexas.edu/hbp/part-20/2-1-records-management-services-documents.  Generally, the University will keep records of applicants for admission or employment for the following periods of time:
Applicants for admission who do not matriculate into the University: one year after the semester during which an individual applies for admission to the University;
Applicants for admission who matriculate into the University: five years after graduation or the last day of attendance;
Applicants for employment who are not hired: two years from the end of the fiscal year during which the individual applies for employment; and
Applicants for employment who are hired: five years after the end of employment.
Some departments may be subject to other laws that require the department to keep certain personal information for a prescribed period.
Please see the records retention schedule for more information.  The University may update the records retention schedule from time to time.
21. Who can I contact for assistance or to complain?
Students with questions about how their personal information is used, or who wish to exercise any of their rights, may consult this policy and contact the Dean of Students, an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/,  or the office that oversees their primary area of study (major).  They may also contact the Registrar’s office.  https://registrar.utexas.edu/

Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity1. Title IX protects all members of our campus community who experience sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), stalking, or discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. These protections apply to students, faculty, staff, contractors, applicants and campus visitors. We are committed to creating and fostering a campus environment free from all forms of sex discrimination.Protection from Prohibited ConductProhibited conduct is a wide range of behavior including sexual harassment, sexual assault,  interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), and stalking. Additionally, the university's revised HOP 3-3031: Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex Discrimination prohibits sex discrimination, sexual exploitation, unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, retaliation, false information and false complaints, and interference with a grievance process under this policy.  The Title IX Office works to prevent prohibited conduct from occurring, and responds seriously and appropriately to all reports of prohibited conduct.Protection from Gender-based HarassmentTitle IX also prohibits gender-based harassment, which the Office for Civil Rights defines as "unwelcome conduct based on a student’s sex, harassing conduct based on a student’s failure to conform to sex stereotypes2." It includes "slurs, taunts, stereotypes, or name-calling, as well as gender-motivated physical threats, attacks, or other hateful conduct3."University policy protects against discrimination on the basis of sex, and our policies include protections for gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. If you feel you are being discriminated against based on your sex or gender, you have the right to report to the Title IX Office.Protection for Pregnant, Nursing, and Parenting StatusTitle IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including on the basis of pregnancy and parenting status. The university is required to provide reasonable accommodations due to pregnancy and parenting needs, including excused absences, changes in the work environment, or alternative participation options4.  If you feel that reasonable accommodations are not being provided, please visit our webpage or contact the Title IX Office.1 “Title IX and Sex Discrimination.” US Department of Education (ED).  www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html.2 “Sex-Based Harassment.” US Department of Education (ED). www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/pro-students/issues/sex-issue01.html.3 “What Is Sex-Based Harassment?” Sex Discrimination, US Department of Education (ED). www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/sex.html#sexhar1.4 “Know Your Rights: Pregnant or Parenting?

Title IX AdvisorsThe Title IX University Advisors are a pool of trained faculty and staff members who are available to assist and advise parties in all investigation tracks (Track A, B, C).In the 2020 Title IX Regulations, investigation outcomes must be determined at a live hearing, with live cross-examination. They further stipulated that cross-examinations at a live hearing must be conducted by an “advisor of choice” (advisor).  In the event that a party does not have an advisor, the university must provide an advisor to conduct cross-examination on behalf of that party. You are not required to have an Advisor for any portion of the Grievance Process, except for the live hearing in Track A or Track B of the Grievance Process. An Advisor can be a friend, family member, attorney, any person of your choosing. You are also not required to maintain the same Advisor for the entirety of the Grievance Process. To help fulfill the needs of the campus community, UT Austin has developed programs to provide advisors to parties engaging in the investigation process: Title IX University Advisors and the Pro Bono Program. You are also not required to utilize a university appointed Advisor. The Pro Bono Program is a partnership with the UT Law School. Advisors through the Pro Bono Program work in pairs to support their party. Advisors are supervised by a licensed attorney and only one may be allowed to serve as an advisor during the live hearing. If you are interested in applying to be a University Title IX Advisor or if you have questions prior to applying, please reach out to supportandresources@austin.utexas.edu.

File a Complaint: Discrimination Form | U.S. Department of Education
How to File a Discrimination Complaint with the Office for Civil Rights
Educational institutions have a responsibility to  protect every student's right to learn in a safe environment free from unlawful  discrimination and to prevent unjust deprivations of that right. The Office for  Civil Rights enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit  discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal financial  assistance from the Department of Education. It is the mission of the Office  for Civil Rights is to ensure equal access to education and to promote  educational excellence throughout the nation through vigorous enforcement of  civil rights.
Discrimination on the basis of race,  color, and national origin is  prohibited by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This includes  discrimination based on a person’s limited English  proficiency or English learner status; and actual  or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, including  membership in a religion that may be perceived to exhibit such characteristics  (such as Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh  individuals).
Discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited by  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.   This includes discrimination based on pregnancy,   parental status, and sex stereotypes (such as  treating persons differently because they do not conform to sex-role  expectations or because they are attracted to or are in relationships with  persons of the same sex).
Discrimination against persons with disabilities is prohibited by Section  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II prohibits discrimination on  the basis of disability by public entities, whether or not they receive federal  financial assistance).  This includes  discrimination against individuals currently  without an impairment that substantially limits of a major life activity, but who have a record of or are regarded as having a disability.
Discrimination on the basis of age is prohibited by Age Discrimination Act of 1975.
These civil rights laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and  universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation  agencies, libraries and museums that receive federal financial assistance from  ED. These include all public schools and  most public and private colleges and universities.
Programs or activities that receive ED funds  must provide aids, benefits or services in a nondiscriminatory manner in an  environment free from discriminatory harassment that limits educational  opportunities. Such aids, benefits or services may include, but are not limited  to, admissions, recruitment, financial aid, academic programs, student  treatment and services, counseling and guidance, discipline, classroom  assignment, grading, vocational education, recreation, physical education,  athletics, and housing.  Some of the  civil rights laws enforced by OCR also extend to employment.
OCR also enforces the Boy  Scouts of America Equal Access Act. Under this Act, OCR can investigate  complaints involving the denial of equal access or a fair opportunity to meet  to, or discrimination against, any  youth group officially affiliated with a group or organization listed  in title 36 of the United States Code (as a patriotic society) that is  intended to serve young people under the age of 21 that requests to conduct a  meeting at a public elementary school, a public  secondary school, or a state or local education agency that receives funds from  ED.

Anyone may file a complaint. The person or organization filing  the complaint need not be a victim of the alleged discrimination but may  complain on behalf of another person or group. A complainant filing on behalf  of or pertaining to another person(s) is responsible for securing any necessary  written consent from that individual, including when a parent files for a  student over the age of 18.
A complaint must ordinarily be filed within 180 days of the last  act of discrimination. If your complaint involves matters that occurred longer  ago than this and you are requesting a waiver, you will be asked to show good  cause why you did not file your complaint within the 180-day period.
Prior to filing a complaint with OCR against an institution, a  potential complainant may want to find out about the institution’s grievance  process and use that process to have the complaint resolved. However, a  complainant is not required by law to use the institutional grievance process  before filing a complaint with OCR. If a complainant uses an institutional  grievance process and also chooses to file the complaint with OCR, the  complaint must be filed with OCR within 60 days after completion of the  institutional grievance process.
Online: You may file a complaint  with OCR using OCR’s electronic complaint form at the following website: http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html.
Mail or Facsimile: You may mail or send by  facsimile information to the address or phone number available at this link.  You may use OCR’s Discrimination  Complaint Form or write your own letter.   If you write your own letter, please include:
The complainant’s name, address and, if possible (although not required), a telephone number where the complainant may be reached during business hours;
Information about the person(s) or class of persons injured by the alleged discriminatory act(s) (names of the injured person(s) are not required);
The name and location (city and state) of the institution that committed the alleged discriminatory act(s); and
A description of the alleged discriminatory act(s) in sufficient detail to enable OCR to understand what occurred, when it occurred, and the basis for the alleged discrimination.
Email: You may email OCR’s Discrimination  Complaint Form or your own signed letter to ocr@ed.gov.  If you write your own letter, please include the information identified above.
For those without current email accounts, Internet access may be  freely available from your local public library, and free email accounts are  available from several large providers.
Note: A recipient of federal financial  assistance may not retaliate against any  person who has made a complaint, testified, assisted or participated in any  manner in an OCR matter or to  interfere with any right or privilege protected by the laws enforced by OCR.  If you believe that you have been retaliated against for any of these reasons,  you also may file a complaint with OCR.
The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a mandatory biennial collection of district-and school-level data. The CRDC is administered by OCR, which uses the data to enforce civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national, origin, sex, and disability. The data are collected from public-school districts and public schools in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The CRDC collects data on civil rights indicators at the early childhood through grade 12 levels. It measures factors that impact education equity and opportunity for students, including student access to courses, programs, resources, instructional and other staff – and school climate factors, such as student discipline and harassment. The CRDC data can be accessed at https://ocrdata.ed.gov. To submit a CRDC data quality concern with OCR, please contact us by emailing ocrdata@ed.gov. Please include “CRDC Data Quality Concern” in the subject heading.
Our mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.

How to File a Charge of Employment Discrimination | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
A .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.
) or https:// means you’ve safely connected to the .gov website. Share sensitive
Note: Federal employees and applicants for federal jobs have a different complaint process.
A charge of discrimination is a signed statement asserting that an organization engaged in employment discrimination. It requests EEOC to take remedial action. The laws enforced by EEOC, except for the Equal Pay Act, require you to file a charge before you can file a lawsuit for unlawful discrimination. There are strict time limits for filing a charge.
Where the discrimination took place can determine how long you have to file a charge. The 180-calendar-day filing deadline is extended to 300- calendar days if a state or local agency enforces a state or local law that prohibits employment discrimination on the same basis. The rules are slightly different for age discrimination charges. For age discrimination, the filing deadline is only extended to 300 days if there is a state law prohibiting age discrimination in employment and a state agency or authority enforcing that law. The deadline is not extended if only a local law prohibits age discrimination.
Online - Use the EEOC Public Portal to Submit an Inquiry, Schedule an Appointment, and File a Charge
A Charge of Discrimination can be completed through our online system after you submit an online inquiry and we interview you. EEOC's Public Portal asks you a few questions to help determine whether EEOC is the right federal agency to handle your complaint involving employment discrimination.
Each EEOC office has appointments, which you can schedule online through the  EEOC Public Portal. Offices also have walk-in appointments. Go to https://www.eeoc.gov/field-office for information about the office closest to you.
In the EEOC's experience, having the opportunity to discuss your concerns with an EEOC staff member in an interview is the best way to assess how to address your concerns about employment discrimination and determine whether filing a charge of discrimination is the appropriate path for you. In any event, the final decision to file a charge is your own.  An EEOC staff member will prepare a charge using the information you provide, which you can review and sign online by logging into your account.
You may file a charge of employment discrimination at the EEOC office closest to where you live, or at any one of the EEOC's 53 field offices. Your charge, however, may be investigated at the EEOC office closest to where the discrimination occurred. If you are a U.S. citizen working for an American company overseas, you should file your charge with the EEOC field office closest to your employer's corporate headquarters.
It is always helpful if you bring with you to the meeting any information or papers that will help us understand your case. For example, if you were fired because of your performance, you might bring with you the letter or notice telling you that you were fired and your performance evaluations. You might also bring with you the names of people who know about what happened and information about how to contact them.
You can bring anyone you want to your meeting, especially if you need language assistance and know someone who can help. You can also bring your lawyer, although you don't have to hire a lawyer to file a charge. If you need special assistance during the meeting, like a sign language or foreign language interpreter, let us know ahead of time so we can arrange for someone to be there for you.
Although we do not take charges over the phone, you can get the process started over the phone. You can call 1-800-669-4000 to discuss your situation.  A representative will ask you for some basic information to determine if your situation is covered by the laws we enforce and explain how to file a charge.
Many states and localities have agencies that enforce laws prohibiting employment discrimination. EEOC refers to these agencies as Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs). EEOC and some FEPAs have worksharing agreements in place to prevent the duplication of effort in charge processing. According to these agreements, if you file a charge with either EEOC or a FEPA, the charge also will be automatically filed with the other agency. This process, which is defined as dual filing, helps to protect charging party rights under both federal and state or local law. If you file a charge at a state or local agency, you can let them know if you also want your charge filed with the EEOC.
If you have 60 days or fewer in which to file a timely charge, the EEOC Public Portal will provide special directions for providing necessary information to the EEOC and how to file your charge quickly.
You can also file a charge by sending us a letter that includes the following information:
The name, address, email, and telephone number of the employer (or employment agency or union) you want to file your charge against
A short description of the actions you believe were discriminatory (for example, you were fired, demoted, harassed)
Why you believe you were discriminated against (for example, because of your race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, genetic information, or retaliation
Don't forget to sign your letter. If you don't sign it, we cannot investigate it.
Your letter will be reviewed and if more information is needed, we will contact you to gather that information.

Web Privacy Policy | IT@UT | | The University of Texas at Austin
How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
This document sets forth the Data Privacy Standards of the University of Texas at Austin (“University”) and provides information about the collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data provided to or otherwise collected or processed by the University.
The purpose of this policy is to establish a generally applicable University-wide data privacy standard and to provide interested persons with information about the University’s collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data regardless of the lawful bases under or legitimate purpose for which the information was obtained.  Subject to state and federal law, the University intends for this policy to be compliant with the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The Data Privacy Standard applies to all domains within the University Web and to any other University action or process concerning the collection, processing, analysis and other data processing of personal information regardless of the method by which such information came to be owned and/or controlled by the University.
The University, by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, “University Web”). While this policy applies across campus, some University websites may have additional policies and practices regarding privacy that also must be observed.  The University’s Data Protection Officer in consultation with the Chief Information Officer must approve any such “local” policies prior to the policy’s implementation.
The University’s Web may contain links to third party external websites over which the University has no control.  The University disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of external websites regardless of a link to such websites being displayed on the University Web.
For the purposes of the policy, “processing” means obtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data, including – organization, adaptation or alteration of the information or data, retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data, disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data.  A “data subject” is a phrase that refers to the person to whom the personal data relates.
Each University Web application or site shall contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
‘Personal information’ or ‘personal data’ means any information that relates to or identifies a person as an individual.
6. How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
The University obtains personal information when a person fills out and submits an application to attend or work at the University along with any additional information the person submits to the University before or after they submit an application.  Persons may also provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services.
In addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services, the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University.  As discussed elsewhere in this policy, some University Web (as well as third party’s) webpages use “cookies” to collect information about the web user.  University Web servers (“Web Server”) may also “collect” information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information:
The data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.
Individual data gathered through a specific process, such as the submission of an application to attend the University, related submissions, and subsequent interaction with admissions staff, will only be used for its intended purpose, such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision, or for certain archiving, research, or statistical purposes described below.  Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University.
The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes (“research purposes”).  Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible.  The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject.  The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes.
Further processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University.  Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University’s processes for human subject research, if applicable, and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects.
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited. For example, when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time the person visited the site, a cookie was probably set on their computer; when they return, the cookie is read again. A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed.
University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID. The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web. Normally, a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community. For example, students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.
Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.
Some pages within the utexas.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a utexas.edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party. Specifically, the following code within a utexas.edu page would represent an example of third party content:
<img src="/%3Ca%20href%3D"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" />
In this example, logo.gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas.edu domain (www.other-org.com in this case). Third party content in utexas.edu is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.
The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when a person visits utexas.edu pages that contain third party content, information, such as their IP address, date, browser, and requested page, is transmitted from your computer to that third party.
9. Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
The University processes personal data for a number of reasons, including to meet its contractual obligations, the legitimate conduct of its business operations, and to comply with applicable law.  Sometimes, consent will be the basis for processing personal data.  In these cases, the University will ask the data subject for consent to process their personal data and to share that data with third parties. The processing of personal data provided to the University by a data subject or from authorized third parties, like their high school or a national testing service, enables the University to identify the data subject; engage in processing an application or other submission to the University; or verify information already provided to the University.
The University may also use or disclose personal data for the following statutory or public interest purposes:  to prevent or detect fraud; to monitor equal opportunity; to better serve the needs of students with disabilities with reasonable accommodations; or for research and statistical purposes, the later purpose relying only on aggregate data.
Furthermore, the University processes personal data either necessary for the University to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with a person (e.g. to assess an offer of services to the University) or for the purposes of a legitimate interest of the University pursued by the University (e.g. equal opportunity monitoring).  The University requires persons to provide the University with certain information during the application process in order to assess their application properly except where providing personal information is marked as optional.  Neither admissions nor employment decisions are automated.
Some University Web websites use Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the user visits the site. This information is used to monitor the effectiveness of the website and to consider potential improvements to the website. The information is non-personal and is transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. The University does not share any specific information about a particular user.
Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics terms of use and Google's privacy practices. To opt out of Google’s data collection, read more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
The University does its best to ensure that the personal information it has is accurate. Users with a UT EID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address at UT Direct.
Although no computer system is 100% secure, the University has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.  See Information Resources Use and Security Policy https://security.utexas.edu/policies/irusp#standard12
The University has policies and procedures in place in case of a data breach or some other incident that places information held by the University in jeopardy.  Any individual who believes a data breach has occurred must immediately notify the Chief Information Security Officer, who will investigate the alleged breach and, if necessary, consult with the University’s Data Breach Response Planning Group and the affected department to remediate the breach, including providing any required notices.
Please see the two policies below for the University’s full data breach policies (UT EID Required).
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/incident-management-procedures
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/data-breach-notification-plan
In certain circumstances, the University may be required to provide notice to affected individuals or certain governing authorities if a data breach results in disclosure of personal data.
Several sites within the University Web enable users to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy to only use confidential information that a user enters during a transaction for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.
Except for educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or information made confidential by other law, all information provided to and collected from the University Web, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the University Web, and information collected from University Web-based forms, along with any other form or type of document or other instrument containing personal information, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.  Such information may also, in the legal context, be subject to discovery requests or other legal demand that personal data or information be released and made public.  The same is true for any personal information obtained by the University through other means such as written submission or communications with previous schools or employers.
The University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users.
As well as circulating application and related materials to the appropriate staff at the University and its various departments and colleges, the University will share personal information for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:
In the case of international applicants, the appropriate state and federal agencies;
Immigration authorities in order to act as a person’s sponsor for visa purposes;
Governmental bodies, including local authorities; the Teachers’ Retirement System; UT Workers Compensation; and other agencies or private actors, such as health care providers, that circumstances require be privy to certain personal information
Other Higher Education organizations, in order to assist with tracking and research into access to Higher Education; and
Companies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, the University and/or one or more of its component colleges, schools, department or programs.
Unless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act or otherwise compelled by lawful means, or as a party to a legal action, it is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the University Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences. For example, the University's portal, UT Direct, enables users to customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot be shared with external third parties, unless required by law.
Consistent with FERPA and other applicable privacy law, the University does not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless the University receives explicit written consent, is required to do so by law, or for other legitimate ends of the University.  University students can read more about directory information in the University's General Information Catalog. Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.
The University makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that users disclose in these areas becomes public information, so users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.
Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Canvas, may be logged. However, FERPA generally prohibits disclosure of these educational records.
The University is a research institution. At any time, the University is conducting numerous online surveys on the University Web. It is University policy only to use personal information gathered in these online surveys for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas Public Information Act or as otherwise compelled by law. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
The University will internally share the personal information it receives from applications and other information submitted to the University in accordance with the University’s policy and practice.  Various university staff and faculty may be involved in processing personal data for the purposes for which the University obtained the data.  In some instances, a third-party vendor employed by the University to assist in data processing might process personal data.  Data subjects have the right to be notified of such third party processing of their personal information.
For students, the University will use the details provided on their application, together with any supporting documents or other forms of information that an applicant may provide with their application.  For the purposes of this policy the “application” includes the online application, application fee, an essay, three short answer prompts, your high school transcripts, any college transcripts, test scores, major-specific items, resume, letters of recommendation (not required) and, if applicable, permanent residence card, student information form, course work form and residency affidavit. Different application forms may apply depending on citizen/residency status.
In addition to the application form, the University will use the details in a transcript from every senior college the applicant has attended.  Where the applicant seeks entry into the graduate Accounting and Nursing programs, University will make use of information from an applicants’ transcripts from all junior and/or community colleges attended as well as past test scores.  The individual graduate programs have additional requirements that may require the University to use additional materials.  The same applies to any letters of recommendation that are received.  The University may also rely on personal information that arises from student conduct investigations or hearings.
For faculty and staff, the University will process personal information received in an application for employment or through an interview as well as other means, formal and informal, and maintain records of employees.  For example, a faculty member may wish to participate in certain health care/insurance programs offered by third party vendors, who have a contract with the University to provide such things.  Enrollment in these programs may require sensitive date to be shared with the relevant third party, such as an insurance carrier.  The University will also make use of testing or evaluations to assess various aspects of faculty and staff performance.  Such information could arise as part of a grievance or disciplinary process.
19. What rights do I have related to my personal information?
Data subjects have the right to access the personal information that the University holds about them. Data subjects also have the right to ask the University to correct any inaccurate personal information the University holds about them.  In some cases, data subjects may request that the University delete personal information, request that the University restrict processing their personal information, or object to the University processing their personal information.
There are several laws, including FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) that give data subjects certain rights so far as it pertains to their personal information.
FERPA provides the right to correct one’s personal data and have access to personal information kept about them.  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
Also, as a general rule but subject to certain exceptions, schools must have written permission from the parent or adult student in order to release any part of the student’s education records.
HIPAA provides certain personal data rights to patients who receive healthcare services at covered entities.  The University is a hybrid entity, which means that certain departments at the University, including, but not limited to, University Health Services (“UHS”) and Dell Medical School, are subject to HIPAA.  Each University department that is subject to HIPAA will provide a Notice of Privacy Practices to patients detailing their rights under HIPAA, including their personal data rights.  For example, a data subject may find the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by UHS at the following link: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/privacypractices.pdf.
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives a person the right to be informed about the information that the University collects about them. It also gives a person the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the University correct any of that information that is wrong. Requests to receive and review any of that information, or request corrections to it, may be made by contacting the University's Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box 8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (email: cfo@www.utexas.edu).
The GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect May 25, 2018.  The GDPR’s intent is to regulate the gathering, use and maintenance of personally identifiable information about a natural person and providing certain rights to the data subject, such as the right to erasure and the right to object to the use of personal data.  This law applies to any person, citizen or not, who at the time of the data collection is located in the European Union.  It does not require an entity, like the University, to be located or acting within the EU for jurisdiction to attach; however, a non-EU entity like the University must process personal data related to the offering of goods or services in the EU or to the monitoring of a person’s behavior in the EU for jurisdiction to attach.
You have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information in accordance with all applicable laws. The erasure of your information will be subject to the retention periods of applicable federal and state law and the University’s Record Retention Schedule. If you have provided consent to the use of your information, you have the right to withdraw consent without affecting the lawfulness of the University's use of the information prior to receipt of your request.  A Data Subject may exercise their rights by contacting the University’s Data Protection Officer.
If you feel the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such information, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in the European Union.
The State of Texas and the United States also have laws that address privacy generally and the use of certain types of records, such as educational and health records (described above), that contain personally identifiable information.  Texas has laws that govern records retention and finally, under US/Texas law, the University may have good reason to keep the information despite a conflict with the GDPR.
As a general rule, in cases where Texas or Federal law conflict with the laws of other countries in regard to the processing, use or maintenance of a data subject’s personal information, including provisions of the GDPR, the University will treat Texas and Federal law as controlling.
University employees who receive a request by a Data Subject to have their data forgotten or who have other questions regarding the rights of Data Subjects provided by the GDPR should contact the University’s Data Protection Officer.
The University is an agency of the state of Texas and must follow a records retention schedule, which may be found at: https://financials.utexas.edu/hbp/part-20/2-1-records-management-services-documents.  Generally, the University will keep records of applicants for admission or employment for the following periods of time:
Applicants for admission who do not matriculate into the University: one year after the semester during which an individual applies for admission to the University;
Applicants for admission who matriculate into the University: five years after graduation or the last day of attendance;
Applicants for employment who are not hired: two years from the end of the fiscal year during which the individual applies for employment; and
Applicants for employment who are hired: five years after the end of employment.
Some departments may be subject to other laws that require the department to keep certain personal information for a prescribed period.
Please see the records retention schedule for more information.  The University may update the records retention schedule from time to time.
Students with questions about how their personal information is used, or who wish to exercise any of their rights, may consult this policy and contact the Dean of Students, an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/,  or the office that oversees their primary area of study (major).  They may also contact the Registrar’s office.  https://registrar.utexas.edu/
Faculty may seek assistance from the chair of their department, the Dean of their college or equivalent position, a representative on the Faculty Council or the Provosts’ office or an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
An employee, should contact their immediate supervisor first, and then if necessary proceed up the chain of command.  Employees are also free to contact the Ombuds office https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
For further assistance, please contact University Compliance Services at Compliance@austin.utexas.edu or call 512-232-7055, the University’s Data Protection Officer, Chris Hutto, chris.hutto@austin.utexas.edu, or the appropriate  college, office or department.

Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity1. Title IX protects all members of our campus community who experience sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), stalking, or discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. These protections apply to students, faculty, staff, contractors, applicants and campus visitors. We are committed to creating and fostering a campus environment free from all forms of sex discrimination.Protection from Prohibited ConductProhibited conduct is a wide range of behavior including sexual harassment, sexual assault,  interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), and stalking. Additionally, the university's revised HOP 3-3031: Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex Discrimination prohibits sex discrimination, sexual exploitation, unprofessional or inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature, retaliation, false information and false complaints, and interference with a grievance process under this policy.  The Title IX Office works to prevent prohibited conduct from occurring, and responds seriously and appropriately to all reports of prohibited conduct.Protection from Gender-based HarassmentTitle IX also prohibits gender-based harassment, which the Office for Civil Rights defines as "unwelcome conduct based on a student’s sex, harassing conduct based on a student’s failure to conform to sex stereotypes2." It includes "slurs, taunts, stereotypes, or name-calling, as well as gender-motivated physical threats, attacks, or other hateful conduct3."University policy protects against discrimination on the basis of sex, and our policies include protections for gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. If you feel you are being discriminated against based on your sex or gender, you have the right to report to the Title IX Office.Protection for Pregnant, Nursing, and Parenting StatusTitle IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including on the basis of pregnancy and parenting status.

Title IX AdvisorsThe Title IX University Advisors are a pool of trained faculty and staff members who are available to assist and advise parties in all investigation tracks (Track A, B, C).In the 2020 Title IX Regulations, investigation outcomes must be determined at a live hearing, with live cross-examination. They further stipulated that cross-examinations at a live hearing must be conducted by an “advisor of choice” (advisor).  In the event that a party does not have an advisor, the university must provide an advisor to conduct cross-examination on behalf of that party. You are not required to have an Advisor for any portion of the Grievance Process, except for the live hearing in Track A or Track B of the Grievance Process. An Advisor can be a friend, family member, attorney, any person of your choosing. You are also not required to maintain the same Advisor for the entirety of the Grievance Process. To help fulfill the needs of the campus community, UT Austin has developed programs to provide advisors to parties engaging in the investigation process: Title IX University Advisors and the Pro Bono Program. You are also not required to utilize a university appointed Advisor. The Pro Bono Program is a partnership with the UT Law School. Advisors through the Pro Bono Program work in pairs to support their party. Advisors are supervised by a licensed attorney and only one may be allowed to serve as an advisor during the live hearing. If you are interested in applying to be a University Title IX Advisor or if you have questions prior to applying, please reach out to supportandresources@austin.utexas.edu.

Web Privacy Policy | IT@UT | | The University of Texas at Austin
How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
Open Records Requests and Other Sharing of Information
What rights do I have related to my personal information?
This document sets forth the Data Privacy Standards of the University of Texas at Austin (“University”) and provides information about the collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data provided to or otherwise collected or processed by the University.
The purpose of this policy is to establish a generally applicable University-wide data privacy standard and to provide interested persons with information about the University’s collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data regardless of the lawful bases under or legitimate purpose for which the information was obtained.  Subject to state and federal law, the University intends for this policy to be compliant with the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The Data Privacy Standard applies to all domains within the University Web and to any other University action or process concerning the collection, processing, analysis and other data processing of personal information regardless of the method by which such information came to be owned and/or controlled by the University.
The University, by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, “University Web”). While this policy applies across campus, some University websites may have additional policies and practices regarding privacy that also must be observed.  The University’s Data Protection Officer in consultation with the Chief Information Officer must approve any such “local” policies prior to the policy’s implementation.
The University’s Web may contain links to third party external websites over which the University has no control.  The University disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of external websites regardless of a link to such websites being displayed on the University Web.
For the purposes of the policy, “processing” means obtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data, including – organization, adaptation or alteration of the information or data, retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data, disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data.  A “data subject” is a phrase that refers to the person to whom the personal data relates.
Each University Web application or site shall contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
5. What is ‘personal information’ or ‘personal data’?
‘Personal information’ or ‘personal data’ means any information that relates to or identifies a person as an individual.
6. How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
The University obtains personal information when a person fills out and submits an application to attend or work at the University along with any additional information the person submits to the University before or after they submit an application.  Persons may also provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services.
In addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services, the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University.  As discussed elsewhere in this policy, some University Web (as well as third party’s) webpages use “cookies” to collect information about the web user.  University Web servers (“Web Server”) may also “collect” information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information:
Internet address (IP address) of computer being used
UIN (unique person identifier for EID-based services only)
The data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.
Individual data gathered through a specific process, such as the submission of an application to attend the University, related submissions, and subsequent interaction with admissions staff, will only be used for its intended purpose, such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision, or for certain archiving, research, or statistical purposes described below.  Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University.
The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes (“research purposes”).  Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible.  The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject.  The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes.
Further processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University.  Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University’s processes for human subject research, if applicable, and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects.
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited. For example, when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time the person visited the site, a cookie was probably set on their computer; when they return, the cookie is read again. A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed.
University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID. The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web. Normally, a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community. For example, students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.
Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.
Some pages within the utexas.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a utexas.edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party. Specifically, the following code within a utexas.edu page would represent an example of third party content:
<img src="/%3Ca%20href%3D"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" />
In this example, logo.gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas.edu domain (www.other-org.com in this case). Third party content in utexas.edu is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.
The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when a person visits utexas.edu pages that contain third party content, information, such as their IP address, date, browser, and requested page, is transmitted from your computer to that third party.
9. Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
The University processes personal data for a number of reasons, including to meet its contractual obligations, the legitimate conduct of its business operations, and to comply with applicable law.  Sometimes, consent will be the basis for processing personal data.  In these cases, the University will ask the data subject for consent to process their personal data and to share that data with third parties. The processing of personal data provided to the University by a data subject or from authorized third parties, like their high school or a national testing service, enables the University to identify the data subject; engage in processing an application or other submission to the University; or verify information already provided to the University.
The University may also use or disclose personal data for the following statutory or public interest purposes:  to prevent or detect fraud; to monitor equal opportunity; to better serve the needs of students with disabilities with reasonable accommodations; or for research and statistical purposes, the later purpose relying only on aggregate data.
Furthermore, the University processes personal data either necessary for the University to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with a person (e.g. to assess an offer of services to the University) or for the purposes of a legitimate interest of the University pursued by the University (e.g. equal opportunity monitoring).  The University requires persons to provide the University with certain information during the application process in order to assess their application properly except where providing personal information is marked as optional.  Neither admissions nor employment decisions are automated.
Some University Web websites use Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the user visits the site.

11. Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information
The University does its best to ensure that the personal information it has is accurate. Users with a UT EID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address at UT Direct.
Although no computer system is 100% secure, the University has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.  See Information Resources Use and Security Policy https://security.utexas.edu/policies/irusp#standard12
The University has policies and procedures in place in case of a data breach or some other incident that places information held by the University in jeopardy.  Any individual who believes a data breach has occurred must immediately notify the Chief Information Security Officer, who will investigate the alleged breach and, if necessary, consult with the University’s Data Breach Response Planning Group and the affected department to remediate the breach, including providing any required notices.
Please see the two policies below for the University’s full data breach policies (UT EID Required).
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/incident-management-procedures
Personally Identifiable Data Breach Notification Plan
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/data-breach-notification-plan
In certain circumstances, the University may be required to provide notice to affected individuals or certain governing authorities if a data breach results in disclosure of personal data.
Several sites within the University Web enable users to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy to only use confidential information that a user enters during a transaction for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.
14. Open Records Requests and Other Sharing of Information
Except for educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or information made confidential by other law, all information provided to and collected from the University Web, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the University Web, and information collected from University Web-based forms, along with any other form or type of document or other instrument containing personal information, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.  Such information may also, in the legal context, be subject to discovery requests or other legal demand that personal data or information be released and made public.  The same is true for any personal information obtained by the University through other means such as written submission or communications with previous schools or employers.
The University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users.
As well as circulating application and related materials to the appropriate staff at the University and its various departments and colleges, the University will share personal information for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:
In the case of international applicants, the appropriate state and federal agencies;
Immigration authorities in order to act as a person’s sponsor for visa purposes;
Governmental bodies, including local authorities; the Teachers’ Retirement System; UT Workers Compensation; and other agencies or private actors, such as health care providers, that circumstances require be privy to certain personal information
Other Higher Education organizations, in order to assist with tracking and research into access to Higher Education; and
Companies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, the University and/or one or more of its component colleges, schools, department or programs.
Unless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act or otherwise compelled by lawful means, or as a party to a legal action, it is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the University Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences. For example, the University's portal, UT Direct, enables users to customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot be shared with external third parties, unless required by law.
Consistent with FERPA and other applicable privacy law, the University does not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless the University receives explicit written consent, is required to do so by law, or for other legitimate ends of the University.  University students can read more about directory information in the University's General Information Catalog. Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.
The University makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that users disclose in these areas becomes public information, so users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.
Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Canvas, may be logged. However, FERPA generally prohibits disclosure of these educational records.
The University is a research institution. At any time, the University is conducting numerous online surveys on the University Web. It is University policy only to use personal information gathered in these online surveys for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas Public Information Act or as otherwise compelled by law. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
The University will internally share the personal information it receives from applications and other information submitted to the University in accordance with the University’s policy and practice.  Various university staff and faculty may be involved in processing personal data for the purposes for which the University obtained the data.  In some instances, a third-party vendor employed by the University to assist in data processing might process personal data.  Data subjects have the right to be notified of such third party processing of their personal information.
For students, the University will use the details provided on their application, together with any supporting documents or other forms of information that an applicant may provide with their application.  For the purposes of this policy the “application” includes the online application, application fee, an essay, three short answer prompts, your high school transcripts, any college transcripts, test scores, major-specific items, resume, letters of recommendation (not required) and, if applicable, permanent residence card, student information form, course work form and residency affidavit. Different application forms may apply depending on citizen/residency status.
In addition to the application form, the University will use the details in a transcript from every senior college the applicant has attended.  Where the applicant seeks entry into the graduate Accounting and Nursing programs, University will make use of information from an applicants’ transcripts from all junior and/or community colleges attended as well as past test scores.  The individual graduate programs have additional requirements that may require the University to use additional materials.  The same applies to any letters of recommendation that are received.  The University may also rely on personal information that arises from student conduct investigations or hearings.
For faculty and staff, the University will process personal information received in an application for employment or through an interview as well as other means, formal and informal, and maintain records of employees.  For example, a faculty member may wish to participate in certain health care/insurance programs offered by third party vendors, who have a contract with the University to provide such things.  Enrollment in these programs may require sensitive date to be shared with the relevant third party, such as an insurance carrier.  The University will also make use of testing or evaluations to assess various aspects of faculty and staff performance.  Such information could arise as part of a grievance or disciplinary process.
19. What rights do I have related to my personal information?
Data subjects have the right to access the personal information that the University holds about them. Data subjects also have the right to ask the University to correct any inaccurate personal information the University holds about them.  In some cases, data subjects may request that the University delete personal information, request that the University restrict processing their personal information, or object to the University processing their personal information.
There are several laws, including FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) that give data subjects certain rights so far as it pertains to their personal information.
FERPA provides the right to correct one’s personal data and have access to personal information kept about them.  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
Also, as a general rule but subject to certain exceptions, schools must have written permission from the parent or adult student in order to release any part of the student’s education records.
HIPAA provides certain personal data rights to patients who receive healthcare services at covered entities.  The University is a hybrid entity, which means that certain departments at the University, including, but not limited to, University Health Services (“UHS”) and Dell Medical School, are subject to HIPAA.  Each University department that is subject to HIPAA will provide a Notice of Privacy Practices to patients detailing their rights under HIPAA, including their personal data rights.  For example, a data subject may find the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by UHS at the following link: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/privacypractices.pdf.
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives a person the right to be informed about the information that the University collects about them. It also gives a person the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the University correct any of that information that is wrong. Requests to receive and review any of that information, or request corrections to it, may be made by contacting the University's Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box 8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (email: cfo@www.utexas.edu).
The GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect May 25, 2018.  The GDPR’s intent is to regulate the gathering, use and maintenance of personally identifiable information about a natural person and providing certain rights to the data subject, such as the right to erasure and the right to object to the use of personal data.  This law applies to any person, citizen or not, who at the time of the data collection is located in the European Union.  It does not require an entity, like the University, to be located or acting within the EU for jurisdiction to attach; however, a non-EU entity like the University must process personal data related to the offering of goods or services in the EU or to the monitoring of a person’s behavior in the EU for jurisdiction to attach.
You have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information in accordance with all applicable laws. The erasure of your information will be subject to the retention periods of applicable federal and state law and the University’s Record Retention Schedule. If you have provided consent to the use of your information, you have the right to withdraw consent without affecting the lawfulness of the University's use of the information prior to receipt of your request.  A Data Subject may exercise their rights by contacting the University’s Data Protection Officer.
If you feel the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such information, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in the European Union.
The State of Texas and the United States also have laws that address privacy generally and the use of certain types of records, such as educational and health records (described above), that contain personally identifiable information.  Texas has laws that govern records retention and finally, under US/Texas law, the University may have good reason to keep the information despite a conflict with the GDPR.
As a general rule, in cases where Texas or Federal law conflict with the laws of other countries in regard to the processing, use or maintenance of a data subject’s personal information, including provisions of the GDPR, the University will treat Texas and Federal law as controlling.
University employees who receive a request by a Data Subject to have their data forgotten or who have other questions regarding the rights of Data Subjects provided by the GDPR should contact the University’s Data Protection Officer.
The University is an agency of the state of Texas and must follow a records retention schedule, which may be found at: https://financials.utexas.edu/hbp/part-20/2-1-records-management-services-documents.  Generally, the University will keep records of applicants for admission or employment for the following periods of time:
Applicants for admission who do not matriculate into the University: one year after the semester during which an individual applies for admission to the University;
Applicants for admission who matriculate into the University: five years after graduation or the last day of attendance;
Applicants for employment who are not hired: two years from the end of the fiscal year during which the individual applies for employment; and
Applicants for employment who are hired: five years after the end of employment.
Some departments may be subject to other laws that require the department to keep certain personal information for a prescribed period.
Please see the records retention schedule for more information.  The University may update the records retention schedule from time to time.
21. Who can I contact for assistance or to complain?
Students with questions about how their personal information is used, or who wish to exercise any of their rights, may consult this policy and contact the Dean of Students, an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/,  or the office that oversees their primary area of study (major).  They may also contact the Registrar’s office.  https://registrar.utexas.edu/
Faculty may seek assistance from the chair of their department, the Dean of their college or equivalent position, a representative on the Faculty Council or the Provosts’ office or an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
An employee, should contact their immediate supervisor first, and then if necessary proceed up the chain of command.  Employees are also free to contact the Ombuds office https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
For further assistance, please contact University Compliance Services at Compliance@austin.utexas.edu or call 512-232-7055, the University’s Data Protection Officer, Chris Hutto, chris.hutto@austin.utexas.edu, or the appropriate  college, office or department.

Web Accessibility Policy | IT@UT | | The University of Texas at Austin
All Web applications and sites at The University of Texas at Austin must meet the statutory requirements in Texas Administrative Code 206.70 Accessibility Standards (TAC 206.70), which references the U.S. Section 508 standards. These statutes require all Web applications and sites to comply with the TAC 206.70 standards. TAC 206.70 establishes only a minimum standard for accessibility; developers are encouraged to go beyond this minimum whenever possible.
Each Web application or site must contain a link for "Web Accessibility Policy" that links to this policy.
The university has designated the following individual as Accessibility Coordinator:
Jennifer W. Maedgen, Senior Associate Vice President and ADAAA, Section 504, and EIR Coordinator
The role of the Accessibility Coordinator is to monitor the university's compliance with accessibility policies and to facilitate training of Web publishers and developers to ensure all Web applications and sites are accessible. The university's Accessibility Coordinator may grant written requests for exceptions to accessibility policies under appropriate circumstances.

Web Privacy Policy | IT@UT | | The University of Texas at Austin
How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
This document sets forth the Data Privacy Standards of the University of Texas at Austin (“University”) and provides information about the collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data provided to or otherwise collected or processed by the University.
The purpose of this policy is to establish a generally applicable University-wide data privacy standard and to provide interested persons with information about the University’s collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data regardless of the lawful bases under or legitimate purpose for which the information was obtained.  Subject to state and federal law, the University intends for this policy to be compliant with the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The Data Privacy Standard applies to all domains within the University Web and to any other University action or process concerning the collection, processing, analysis and other data processing of personal information regardless of the method by which such information came to be owned and/or controlled by the University.
The University, by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, “University Web”). While this policy applies across campus, some University websites may have additional policies and practices regarding privacy that also must be observed.  The University’s Data Protection Officer in consultation with the Chief Information Officer must approve any such “local” policies prior to the policy’s implementation.
The University’s Web may contain links to third party external websites over which the University has no control.  The University disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of external websites regardless of a link to such websites being displayed on the University Web.
For the purposes of the policy, “processing” means obtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data, including – organization, adaptation or alteration of the information or data, retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data, disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data.  A “data subject” is a phrase that refers to the person to whom the personal data relates.
Each University Web application or site shall contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
‘Personal information’ or ‘personal data’ means any information that relates to or identifies a person as an individual.
6. How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
The University obtains personal information when a person fills out and submits an application to attend or work at the University along with any additional information the person submits to the University before or after they submit an application.  Persons may also provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services.
In addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services, the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University.  As discussed elsewhere in this policy, some University Web (as well as third party’s) webpages use “cookies” to collect information about the web user.  University Web servers (“Web Server”) may also “collect” information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information:
The data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.
Individual data gathered through a specific process, such as the submission of an application to attend the University, related submissions, and subsequent interaction with admissions staff, will only be used for its intended purpose, such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision, or for certain archiving, research, or statistical purposes described below.  Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University.
The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes (“research purposes”).  Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible.  The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject.  The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes.
Further processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University.  Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University’s processes for human subject research, if applicable, and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects.
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited. For example, when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time the person visited the site, a cookie was probably set on their computer; when they return, the cookie is read again. A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed.
University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID. The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web. Normally, a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community. For example, students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.
Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.
Some pages within the utexas.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a utexas.edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party. Specifically, the following code within a utexas.edu page would represent an example of third party content:
<img src="/%3Ca%20href%3D"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" />
In this example, logo.gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas.edu domain (www.other-org.com in this case). Third party content in utexas.edu is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.
The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when a person visits utexas.edu pages that contain third party content, information, such as their IP address, date, browser, and requested page, is transmitted from your computer to that third party.
9. Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
The University processes personal data for a number of reasons, including to meet its contractual obligations, the legitimate conduct of its business operations, and to comply with applicable law.  Sometimes, consent will be the basis for processing personal data.  In these cases, the University will ask the data subject for consent to process their personal data and to share that data with third parties. The processing of personal data provided to the University by a data subject or from authorized third parties, like their high school or a national testing service, enables the University to identify the data subject; engage in processing an application or other submission to the University; or verify information already provided to the University.
The University may also use or disclose personal data for the following statutory or public interest purposes:  to prevent or detect fraud; to monitor equal opportunity; to better serve the needs of students with disabilities with reasonable accommodations; or for research and statistical purposes, the later purpose relying only on aggregate data.
Furthermore, the University processes personal data either necessary for the University to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with a person (e.g. to assess an offer of services to the University) or for the purposes of a legitimate interest of the University pursued by the University (e.g. equal opportunity monitoring).  The University requires persons to provide the University with certain information during the application process in order to assess their application properly except where providing personal information is marked as optional.  Neither admissions nor employment decisions are automated.
Some University Web websites use Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the user visits the site. This information is used to monitor the effectiveness of the website and to consider potential improvements to the website. The information is non-personal and is transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. The University does not share any specific information about a particular user.
Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics terms of use and Google's privacy practices. To opt out of Google’s data collection, read more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
The University does its best to ensure that the personal information it has is accurate. Users with a UT EID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address at UT Direct.
Although no computer system is 100% secure, the University has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.  See Information Resources Use and Security Policy https://security.utexas.edu/policies/irusp#standard12
The University has policies and procedures in place in case of a data breach or some other incident that places information held by the University in jeopardy.  Any individual who believes a data breach has occurred must immediately notify the Chief Information Security Officer, who will investigate the alleged breach and, if necessary, consult with the University’s Data Breach Response Planning Group and the affected department to remediate the breach, including providing any required notices.
Please see the two policies below for the University’s full data breach policies (UT EID Required).
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/incident-management-procedures
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/data-breach-notification-plan
In certain circumstances, the University may be required to provide notice to affected individuals or certain governing authorities if a data breach results in disclosure of personal data.
Several sites within the University Web enable users to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy to only use confidential information that a user enters during a transaction for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.
Except for educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or information made confidential by other law, all information provided to and collected from the University Web, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the University Web, and information collected from University Web-based forms, along with any other form or type of document or other instrument containing personal information, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.  Such information may also, in the legal context, be subject to discovery requests or other legal demand that personal data or information be released and made public.  The same is true for any personal information obtained by the University through other means such as written submission or communications with previous schools or employers.
The University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users.
As well as circulating application and related materials to the appropriate staff at the University and its various departments and colleges, the University will share personal information for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:
In the case of international applicants, the appropriate state and federal agencies;
Immigration authorities in order to act as a person’s sponsor for visa purposes;
Governmental bodies, including local authorities; the Teachers’ Retirement System; UT Workers Compensation; and other agencies or private actors, such as health care providers, that circumstances require be privy to certain personal information
Other Higher Education organizations, in order to assist with tracking and research into access to Higher Education; and
Companies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, the University and/or one or more of its component colleges, schools, department or programs.
Unless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act or otherwise compelled by lawful means, or as a party to a legal action, it is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the University Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences. For example, the University's portal, UT Direct, enables users to customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot be shared with external third parties, unless required by law.
Consistent with FERPA and other applicable privacy law, the University does not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless the University receives explicit written consent, is required to do so by law, or for other legitimate ends of the University.  University students can read more about directory information in the University's General Information Catalog. Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.
The University makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that users disclose in these areas becomes public information, so users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.
Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Canvas, may be logged. However, FERPA generally prohibits disclosure of these educational records.
The University is a research institution. At any time, the University is conducting numerous online surveys on the University Web. It is University policy only to use personal information gathered in these online surveys for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas Public Information Act or as otherwise compelled by law. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
The University will internally share the personal information it receives from applications and other information submitted to the University in accordance with the University’s policy and practice.  Various university staff and faculty may be involved in processing personal data for the purposes for which the University obtained the data.  In some instances, a third-party vendor employed by the University to assist in data processing might process personal data.  Data subjects have the right to be notified of such third party processing of their personal information.
For students, the University will use the details provided on their application, together with any supporting documents or other forms of information that an applicant may provide with their application.  For the purposes of this policy the “application” includes the online application, application fee, an essay, three short answer prompts, your high school transcripts, any college transcripts, test scores, major-specific items, resume, letters of recommendation (not required) and, if applicable, permanent residence card, student information form, course work form and residency affidavit. Different application forms may apply depending on citizen/residency status.
In addition to the application form, the University will use the details in a transcript from every senior college the applicant has attended.  Where the applicant seeks entry into the graduate Accounting and Nursing programs, University will make use of information from an applicants’ transcripts from all junior and/or community colleges attended as well as past test scores.  The individual graduate programs have additional requirements that may require the University to use additional materials.  The same applies to any letters of recommendation that are received.  The University may also rely on personal information that arises from student conduct investigations or hearings.
For faculty and staff, the University will process personal information received in an application for employment or through an interview as well as other means, formal and informal, and maintain records of employees.  For example, a faculty member may wish to participate in certain health care/insurance programs offered by third party vendors, who have a contract with the University to provide such things.  Enrollment in these programs may require sensitive date to be shared with the relevant third party, such as an insurance carrier.  The University will also make use of testing or evaluations to assess various aspects of faculty and staff performance.  Such information could arise as part of a grievance or disciplinary process.
19. What rights do I have related to my personal information?
Data subjects have the right to access the personal information that the University holds about them. Data subjects also have the right to ask the University to correct any inaccurate personal information the University holds about them.  In some cases, data subjects may request that the University delete personal information, request that the University restrict processing their personal information, or object to the University processing their personal information.
There are several laws, including FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) that give data subjects certain rights so far as it pertains to their personal information.
FERPA provides the right to correct one’s personal data and have access to personal information kept about them.  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
Also, as a general rule but subject to certain exceptions, schools must have written permission from the parent or adult student in order to release any part of the student’s education records.
HIPAA provides certain personal data rights to patients who receive healthcare services at covered entities.  The University is a hybrid entity, which means that certain departments at the University, including, but not limited to, University Health Services (“UHS”) and Dell Medical School, are subject to HIPAA.  Each University department that is subject to HIPAA will provide a Notice of Privacy Practices to patients detailing their rights under HIPAA, including their personal data rights.  For example, a data subject may find the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by UHS at the following link: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/privacypractices.pdf.
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives a person the right to be informed about the information that the University collects about them. It also gives a person the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the University correct any of that information that is wrong. Requests to receive and review any of that information, or request corrections to it, may be made by contacting the University's Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box 8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (email: cfo@www.utexas.edu).
The GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect May 25, 2018.  The GDPR’s intent is to regulate the gathering, use and maintenance of personally identifiable information about a natural person and providing certain rights to the data subject, such as the right to erasure and the right to object to the use of personal data.  This law applies to any person, citizen or not, who at the time of the data collection is located in the European Union.  It does not require an entity, like the University, to be located or acting within the EU for jurisdiction to attach; however, a non-EU entity like the University must process personal data related to the offering of goods or services in the EU or to the monitoring of a person’s behavior in the EU for jurisdiction to attach.
You have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information in accordance with all applicable laws. The erasure of your information will be subject to the retention periods of applicable federal and state law and the University’s Record Retention Schedule. If you have provided consent to the use of your information, you have the right to withdraw consent without affecting the lawfulness of the University's use of the information prior to receipt of your request.  A Data Subject may exercise their rights by contacting the University’s Data Protection Officer.
If you feel the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such information, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in the European Union.
The State of Texas and the United States also have laws that address privacy generally and the use of certain types of records, such as educational and health records (described above), that contain personally identifiable information.  Texas has laws that govern records retention and finally, under US/Texas law, the University may have good reason to keep the information despite a conflict with the GDPR.
As a general rule, in cases where Texas or Federal law conflict with the laws of other countries in regard to the processing, use or maintenance of a data subject’s personal information, including provisions of the GDPR, the University will treat Texas and Federal law as controlling.
University employees who receive a request by a Data Subject to have their data forgotten or who have other questions regarding the rights of Data Subjects provided by the GDPR should contact the University’s Data Protection Officer.
The University is an agency of the state of Texas and must follow a records retention schedule, which may be found at: https://financials.utexas.edu/hbp/part-20/2-1-records-management-services-documents.  Generally, the University will keep records of applicants for admission or employment for the following periods of time:
Applicants for admission who do not matriculate into the University: one year after the semester during which an individual applies for admission to the University;
Applicants for admission who matriculate into the University: five years after graduation or the last day of attendance;
Applicants for employment who are not hired: two years from the end of the fiscal year during which the individual applies for employment; and
Applicants for employment who are hired: five years after the end of employment.
Some departments may be subject to other laws that require the department to keep certain personal information for a prescribed period.
Please see the records retention schedule for more information.  The University may update the records retention schedule from time to time.
Students with questions about how their personal information is used, or who wish to exercise any of their rights, may consult this policy and contact the Dean of Students, an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/,  or the office that oversees their primary area of study (major).  They may also contact the Registrar’s office.  https://registrar.utexas.edu/
Faculty may seek assistance from the chair of their department, the Dean of their college or equivalent position, a representative on the Faculty Council or the Provosts’ office or an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
An employee, should contact their immediate supervisor first, and then if necessary proceed up the chain of command.  Employees are also free to contact the Ombuds office https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
For further assistance, please contact University Compliance Services at Compliance@austin.utexas.edu or call 512-232-7055, the University’s Data Protection Officer, Chris Hutto, chris.hutto@austin.utexas.edu, or the appropriate  college, office or department.

The University and the Law School are committed to creating and fostering a campus environment free from all forms of sex discrimination. Title IX, as well as state law and university policy, protect all members of our campus community who experience sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), stalking, or discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.
The University’s Title IX Office, Office for Inclusion and Equity, and Department of Investigation and Adjudication are responsible for investigating all Title IX reports at UT Austin. The Law School does not have its own Title IX process. Any Title IX incident involving law students, faculty, or staff must be reported to and addressed by the University’s Title IX Office.
Assistant Dean Elizabeth Bangs has received comprehensive Title IX training and is available to provide resources and support. Any student with questions or concerns about Title IX is welcome and encouraged to contact either Dean Bangs or the Title IX office.
All University employees (both faculty and staff) who are not designated as Confidential Resources are required to promptly report any knowledge of any incidents of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, or stalking “committed by or against a person who was a student enrolled at or an employee of the institution at the time of the incident.” Texas Education Code 51.252.  If you disclose a Title IX incident to a faculty or staff member, they are required to report the incident to the University’s Title IX Office. As a student, you always have the option to request a dismissal of the investigation or be a Reluctant Complainant in the investigation process, which means you don’t have to participate in the investigation.
If you have been subject to or have become aware of a possible Title IX violation, but you are not ready to file a report or pursue the grievance process, the University has designated a number of Confidential Resources. These are staff members who are not required to report Title IX incidents that are disclosed to them. They include the providers at the Counseling and Mental Health Center and trained, professional Advocates in the Student Emergency Services Office. When meeting with a confidential support person, you may share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. Confidential Resources are available to help by:
Offering a safe and private setting to discuss questions, concerns, and experiences;
Providing information about your rights and options regarding the Title IX reporting and investigation process;
Exploring academic, housing, medical, and or/ financial accommodations and remedies; and
If you have been subject to a possible Title IX violation — or are concerned about a possible violation you have witnessed or become aware of — and wish to initiate the grievance process, you may file a report directly with the Title IX Office or meet with Dean Bangs for assistance in filing a report.
The incident has negatively affected your academics or employment.
You have concerns about your safety or the safety of the community.
You need someone to confide in or want to seek assistance and support, even if you are not seeking action or do not want to name the Respondent.
You want the University to pursue disciplinary action against the Respondent.
You want a No Contact Directive to be put in place between you and the Respondent.
Reporting an incident informs the University of the incident, which allows the institution to provide support, resources, and accommodations to all the parties impacted by the incident and does not necessarily result in the initiation of a grievance process.
If you choose to file a Formal Complaint (a request that the University initiate an investigation and possible disciplinary action), the Title IX Office will reach out to both parties to discuss next steps and provide information on specific resources and accommodations related to the Formal Complaint. The Title IX Office will then initiate the appropriate Grievance Process.
All reports are treated with the greatest degree of confidentiality possible. Confidentiality is maintained on a need-to-know basis with respect to the University’s obligations to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct and take the appropriate corrective action.
Members of the University community will not be informed of the outcome of a Title IX investigation to which they are not a party.
The University’s Consensual Relationships Policy prohibits consensual relationships between:
employees (including faculty) or affiliates and any graduate student whom that individual teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way; and
student employees and any student whom that student employee teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way.
Title IX also prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and parenting status. The University and Law School provide reasonable accommodations due to pregnancy and parenting needs. If you are seeking pregnancy and parenting-related accommodations, make an appointment with Assistant Dean Elizabeth Bangs. You may also contact the University’s Title IX Office.
JON 5.226 and 6.226 and TNH 3.107 are lactation rooms available for student use. (The JON rooms are available only during regular business hours.) Please contact the Student Affairs Office or the Human Resources Office for the door codes.

The University of Texas School of Law began as The University of Texas at Austin’s Department of Law when the university was founded in 1883. The law school started with two professors and 52 students in the basement of the university’s Old Main Building. The school has since grown to more than 900 students and offers the Doctor of Jurisprudence (J.D.) and the Master of Laws (LL.M.).
On July 1, 2022, Robert (Bobby) Chesney became Dean, taking over the role from Ward Farnsworth who served as Dean for 10 years. The Department of Law appointed its first dean, John C. Townes, in 1901, and moved out of the basement and into its own building in 1908. The Department of Law became The University of Texas School of Law in 1920. By 1935, it had become one of the largest law schools in the United States, and required a new building. In 1952 construction began on Townes Hall. Two additional buildings were later added: Jones Hall, completed in 1981, which became home to the Tarlton Law Library, which houses the Susman Academic Center; and the Connally Center, dedicated in 2001, which houses the Eidman Courtroom, the Advocacy Program and much of the Clinical Program. In 2021, renovations to outdoor spaces to the north side of Townes Hall included the Patman Family Plaza and Dee J. Kelly Courtyard.
Clinical legal education at the School of Law began in 1974, and has steadily expanded. Today, there are more than 15 different legal clinics as well as numerous internship programs that provide extensive opportunities to work on legal issues in real-world settings. Clinics have allowed students to represent clients in misdemeanor proceedings, attend oral arguments in the United States Supreme Court of cases they worked on, represent families seeking asylum, and assist victims of domestic violence, to name only a few examples.
The Advocacy Program was founded in 1978 to facilitate the teaching of advocacy at Texas Law. The program supports both academic courses and extracurricular competitions and activities in the advocacy field. Texas Law student teams have won numerous regional and national advocacy championships, with hundreds of students participating annually in mock trial, moot court, transactional, and dispute resolution competitions.
The law school has approximately 26,000 living alumni who have forged distinguished careers in government, public-service organizations, corporations, and law firms throughout Texas, the nation, and the world. Well-known graduates include former U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III; former U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Strauss; former Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr.; Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood; Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Reynaldo Garza; former U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison; Secretary of Energy Federico Peña; former Dallas Mayor and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk; presidential advisor Paul Begala; litigator Joe Jamail; criminal defense attorney Dick DeGuerin; Ford Foundation president Darren Walker; and cartoonist Sam Hurt.

A Combat Veteran, A Mother of Three, A Winning Advocate: Meet Diana Kensy ’23
From West Point and a tour of Afghanistan to the challenge of raising a young family while going back to school, all of Diana Kensy’s experiences have made her appreciate the value of the opportunities at Texas Law. They also prepared her for victory in her first trial, through the Domestic Violence Clinic. Read this story.
Global constitutional expert Richard Albert has seen his research relied upon numerous times in countries around the world reviewing or rewriting their constitutions. In 2021, he advised the Constitutional Convention of Chile on designing procedures of constitutional reform for the country’s proposed constitution. And in 2022, the Supreme Court of Kenya relied extensively on his theory of constitutional dismemberment in its decision on a major dispute over a constitutional reform.
Now, Prof. Albert is helping Jamaica—the country where his parents met and his great-great-grandfather was born—in its transition from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. Albert is one of 15 people appointed by the Jamaican Prime Minister to serve on the Constitution Reform Committee, helping to lay the groundwork for a new governmental framework.
According to Albert, the CRC has three objectives. “One, to replace the King with a Jamaican Head of State,” says Albert. “Two, to modernize the country’s constitutional arrangements. And three, to patriate the Constitution – to bring it home, at last, from the United Kingdom.”
Within minutes of the announcement of the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion in 303 Creative v. Elenis, Prof. Elizabeth Sepper found herself on the radio explaining the potentially far-reaching implications of the court’s decision and her concerns about them. “The central issue was whether states can apply anti-discrimination law to a commercial business that uses some expression in the production of their products. The court said, no, that the free speech clause bars that application. And that applies across the nation to applications of public accommodations anti-discrimination laws, and potentially further into other areas of anti-discrimination law.”
Sepper, one of the nation’s foremost experts on public accommodations laws, was cited in Justice Sotomayor’s dissent in 303 Creative. She has written extensively on how the history of anti-discrimination laws relates to current conflicts between these laws and the rights of free speech and free exercise of religion.
With a focus at the intersections of equality, healthcare, and religious rights, her extensive scholarship probes the ambiguities and potential conflicts among these subjects. “I don’t think I fit in a box. I’m a bit of a chameleon,” says Sepper.
When many lawyers think about the first year of law school, they recall coffee-fueled discussions about the theories behind contract consideration and tort law remedies. Prof. Erik Encarnacion wants to change the way the profession thinks about these foundational concepts.
Encarnacion’s new research includes a series of articles on how resilience can shape traditional private law. His writing and speaking on resilience thus far have focused on tort law remedies, but this lawyer and philosopher hopes to open the door to questions about the bases for modern law. In “Resilience, Retribution, and Punitive Damages,” Encarnacion introduces the concept of “retributive resilience” in punitive damages.
The paper argues that rather than representing an unjustified “windfall,” awards of punitive damages paid to the plaintiff can in appropriate cases be “a crucial avenue by which victims may attain a constructive form of retributive justice that allows them to demonstrate, to themselves and others, their resilience.” This is a departure from the widely-held view that punitive damages are inherently opposed to tort law’s compensatory aims, and Encarnacion says he resists “knee-jerk hostility to punitive damages.”
“It’s the best class I ever taught in my life.” That’s how Prof. A. Mechele Dickerson, describes “COVID and the Law,” the course she created in 2021 to discuss lessons in law and society learned from the pandemic. Because that pandemic was still ongoing as the course began, Dickerson realized that the best way to teach it was to bring in guest lecturers from around the entire university. In each weekly session, students heard from experts on medical issues, environmental justice, the rights of people who are in jails, prisons, and detention facilities, workplace health and safety laws, intellectual property law, and more.
The broad scope captured essential parts of Dickerson’s approach to both her scholarship and teaching: embrace interdisciplinary learning and find inspiration in real-world challenges.
“Texas, in terms of my scholarship and my teaching, is absolutely perfect, because we’re a very large research university, which means that I am given grace and flexibility to teach where my research is going,” says Dickerson, who has been recognized for both her teaching and her scholarship as an elected member of the American Law Institute and an inductee into the University of Texas Academy of Distinguished Teachers.

The University and the Law School are committed to creating and fostering a campus environment free from all forms of sex discrimination. Title IX, as well as state law and university policy, protect all members of our campus community who experience sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), stalking, or discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.
The University’s Title IX Office, Office for Inclusion and Equity, and Department of Investigation and Adjudication are responsible for investigating all Title IX reports at UT Austin. The Law School does not have its own Title IX process. Any Title IX incident involving law students, faculty, or staff must be reported to and addressed by the University’s Title IX Office.
Assistant Dean Elizabeth Bangs has received comprehensive Title IX training and is available to provide resources and support. Any student with questions or concerns about Title IX is welcome and encouraged to contact either Dean Bangs or the Title IX office.
All University employees (both faculty and staff) who are not designated as Confidential Resources are required to promptly report any knowledge of any incidents of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, or stalking “committed by or against a person who was a student enrolled at or an employee of the institution at the time of the incident.” Texas Education Code 51.252.  If you disclose a Title IX incident to a faculty or staff member, they are required to report the incident to the University’s Title IX Office. As a student, you always have the option to request a dismissal of the investigation or be a Reluctant Complainant in the investigation process, which means you don’t have to participate in the investigation.
If you have been subject to or have become aware of a possible Title IX violation, but you are not ready to file a report or pursue the grievance process, the University has designated a number of Confidential Resources. These are staff members who are not required to report Title IX incidents that are disclosed to them. They include the providers at the Counseling and Mental Health Center and trained, professional Advocates in the Student Emergency Services Office. When meeting with a confidential support person, you may share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. Confidential Resources are available to help by:
Offering a safe and private setting to discuss questions, concerns, and experiences;
Providing information about your rights and options regarding the Title IX reporting and investigation process;
Exploring academic, housing, medical, and or/ financial accommodations and remedies; and
If you have been subject to a possible Title IX violation — or are concerned about a possible violation you have witnessed or become aware of — and wish to initiate the grievance process, you may file a report directly with the Title IX Office or meet with Dean Bangs for assistance in filing a report.
The incident has negatively affected your academics or employment.
You have concerns about your safety or the safety of the community.
You need someone to confide in or want to seek assistance and support, even if you are not seeking action or do not want to name the Respondent.
You want the University to pursue disciplinary action against the Respondent.
You want a No Contact Directive to be put in place between you and the Respondent.
Reporting an incident informs the University of the incident, which allows the institution to provide support, resources, and accommodations to all the parties impacted by the incident and does not necessarily result in the initiation of a grievance process.
If you choose to file a Formal Complaint (a request that the University initiate an investigation and possible disciplinary action), the Title IX Office will reach out to both parties to discuss next steps and provide information on specific resources and accommodations related to the Formal Complaint. The Title IX Office will then initiate the appropriate Grievance Process.
All reports are treated with the greatest degree of confidentiality possible. Confidentiality is maintained on a need-to-know basis with respect to the University’s obligations to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct and take the appropriate corrective action.
Members of the University community will not be informed of the outcome of a Title IX investigation to which they are not a party.
The University’s Consensual Relationships Policy prohibits consensual relationships between:
employees (including faculty) or affiliates and any graduate student whom that individual teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way; and
student employees and any student whom that student employee teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way.
Title IX also prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and parenting status. The University and Law School provide reasonable accommodations due to pregnancy and parenting needs. If you are seeking pregnancy and parenting-related accommodations, make an appointment with Assistant Dean Elizabeth Bangs. You may also contact the University’s Title IX Office.
JON 5.226 and 6.226 and TNH 3.107 are lactation rooms available for student use. (The JON rooms are available only during regular business hours.) Please contact the Student Affairs Office or the Human Resources Office for the door codes.
University Policies are designed to communicate institutional rules for operation, organization, and programming of the university, including policy relating to students.
The University Policy Office (UPO) is an administrative unit with responsibility for the strategic design and implementation of the university policy management program. UPO coordinates policy lifecycle management with key policy owners and maintains the Handbook of Operating Procedures (HOP) policy library and website.
The HOP contains the university's governing policies. These policies connect the university's mission to the everyday actions of its community, clarify the university's expectations of its individual members, mitigate institutional risk, enhance efficiency, and support the university's compliance with laws and regulations. Policies found in the HOP direct the function of administrative operations or University activities, but do not include educational policies developed through faculty legislation.
The University of Texas at Austin has adopted ComplianceBridge as the primary policy management system for the university. The HOP policy library can be viewed at the UT Policy Library webpage.
This catalog is the document of authority for all students and includes undergraduate, graduate, law, and medical students. Any academic unit may issue additional or more specific information that is consistent with approved policy.
Information and guidance on technology resources available to the university. This includes policies, standards, guidelines, IT-related construction standards, and other IT-related documents.
The Handbook of Business Procedures (HBP) contains the fiscal policies and procedures for Financial Affairs at The University of Texas at Austin. The HBP is designed to provide information and guidance to departments regarding the appropriate handling of financial matters. The HBP is organized by process into several broad topic areas, called Parts
Policies can be found in a variety of locations at the university. Highlighted here are some of the more common policies and procedures.

Consensual Relationships   Handbook of Operating Procedures 3-3050Consensual RelationshipsEffective January 03, 2017Executive Sponsor: Chief Compliance OfficerPolicy Owner: Associate Vice President for Investigation and Adjudication Policy StatementThe University of Texas at Austin ("University") is committed to maintaining an academic community(including associated teaching, research, working and athletic environments) free from conflicts of interest, favoritism, and exploitation. This policy addresses romantic relationships and/or sexual interactions that, although consensual, may create actual and perceived conflicts of interests, and create the possibility for exploitation or favoritism.Except as expressly permitted herein, this policy prohibits consensual relationships between: employees (including faculty) or University affiliates ("affiliates") and undergraduate students; employees (including faculty) or affiliates and any graduate student whom that individual teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way; Intercollegiate Athletics coaches, affiliates, or athletics employees and student-athletes; student employees and any student whom that student employee teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way; and employees (including faculty) and/or affiliates where one teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates the other in any way, unless the person in the position of greater authority or power notifies appropriate University offices and a mitigation plan (as defined below) is in place.  Reason for PolicyThe University recognizes that consenting individuals associated with the University should be free to enter into personal relationships of their choice. At the same time, such relationships must not put at risk the fundamental interest of every member of the University community to participate in University activities free from conflicts of interests, favoritism, and/or exploitation. Romantic relationships between certain categories of individuals affiliated with the University risks undermining the essential educational purpose of the University and can disrupt the workplace and learning environment.  Scope & AudienceThis policy applies to all University employees (including faculty), student employees, students, and affiliates. This policy is applicable regardless of the sex/gender of the individual with managerial, supervisory, teaching, evaluation, coaching or advisory authority, and/or the sex/gender of the individual who is managed, supervised, taught, coached, advised, or evaluated in any way.  Definitions (specific to this policy)Coach:Any person serving in the capacity as an Intercollegiate Athletics head coach, associate head coach, assistant coach, graduate assistant coach, coaching intern, volunteer coach, or any individual exercising coaching responsibilities.Consensual Relationship:A romantic relationship and/or sexual interaction agreed to by the involved parties.Employee:Except as specifically stated herein, employee includes faculty, classified staff, administrative and professional staff, post-doctoral positions, and employee positions requiring student status.Mitigation Plan:A written plan developed as provided in this policy that mitigates the conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism created by the consensual relationship and which plan is acknowledged and signed by the parties involved.Student-Athlete:Any student (undergraduate or graduate) who is currently participating as a member of an intercollegiate varsity sport sponsored by the University.Supervisee:Any individual whose terms and conditions of employment, student, student-athlete, or affiliate status are controlled or affected by a supervisor, as defined by this policy.Supervisor:An employee (including faculty), student, or affiliate who: teaches, manages, supervises, advises, coaches, or evaluates in any way other employees, students, student-athletes, or affiliates; and/or has a position of power, control, or the ability to influence decisions with regard to other individuals in the learning, intercollegiate athletics, or working environment of the University.University Affiliate:An individual associated with the University in a capacity other than as a student or employee who has access to University resources through a contractual arrangement or other association that has been reviewed and approved in accordance with guidelines established by Human Resources ("HR"), the Executive Vice President and Provost ("EVPP"), or the Vice President for Research. Examples of a University Affiliate may include, but are not limited to: employees of contractors hired to conduct repair work at the University; employees of vendors engaged to provide training to University administrators; health care providers retained by the University to provide medical services to students/staff; volunteers in academic and/or operational units within the University; and post-doctoral positions who receive external funding; researchers or recent graduates who are self-funded or independently funded, but utilize University facilities to further the University's research endeavors.Additional information regarding other types of University Affiliates may be found at: http://www.utexas.edu/business/erp/hrms/help/UniversityAffiliateTypes.php.  Website (for policy)https://secure2.compliancebridge.com/utexas/public/getdoc.php?file=3-3050  Contacts    CONTACT   DETAILS   WEB     Department of Investigation and Adjudication (DIA)   Phone: 512-471-3701   Website:  https://compliance.utexas.edu/department- investigation-and-adjudication Email: dia@austin.utexas.edu     University Compliance Services (UCS)    Phone: 512-232-7055   Website:  https://compliance.utexas.edu/    Human Resources-Strategic Workforce Solutions   Phone: 512-475-7200			              512-232-3523   Website: https://hr.utexas.edu/current/services/ Email: hrs.sws@austin.utexas.edu     Employee Assistance Program   Address:			UTA, Rm 2.304 Phone: 512-471-3366   Website: https://hr.utexas.edu/eap/ Email: eap@austin.utexas.edu    Office of the Dean of Students - Student Emergency Services Phone: 512-471-5017  Website: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency Email: studentemergency@austin.utexas.edu    UT Counseling and Mental Health Center Phone: 512-471-3515  Website: https://cmhc.utexas.edu/    Intercollegiate Athletics - Human Resources  Phone: 512-232-1276  Website: http://texassports.com/HR    Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost  Phone: 512-471-4363  Website: https://provost.utexas.edu/     Responsibilities & Procedures Prohibited Consensual RelationshipsThe following consensual relationships, even if a single interaction, are prohibited and cannot be mitigated by a mitigation plan. Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority, the University prohibits any employee (including faculty) or affiliate of the University from engaging in a consensual relationship with any student currently enrolled as an undergraduate at the University.**Note: "Employee"; as used in Section VII.A.1 does not include student employees. See Section VII.A.4 below for prohibitions applicable to University student employees. Also, for purposes of this policy, the term "undergraduate" does not include any individual who is considered an undergraduate at the University solely because the individual is taking course(s) through the Staff Educational Benefit offered to University employees. Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority between graduate students and their educators, advisors, supervisors, and others holding positions of authority over them, the University prohibits any employee (including faculty) or affiliate of the University from engaging in a consensual relationship with any graduate student whom they teach, manage, supervise, advise, or evaluate in any way. Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority, the University prohibits consensual relationships between Intercollegiate Athletics coaches, employees, or affiliates, with any student-athlete or student assigned to or associated with Intercollegiate Athletics, such as interns and student employees.*Note: "Employee" as used in Section VII.A.3 does not include student employees except for those who teach, manage, supervise, advise, coach, or evaluate any student-athlete or student assigned to or associated with Intercollegiate Athletics. Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority, the University prohibits any student employee (including resident life advisors/assistants, assistant instructors, teaching assistants, graduate research assistants, etc.) from engaging in a consensual relationship with any student whom they teach, manage, supervise, advise, or evaluate in any way.  Reporting Requirements Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority, the University prohibits consensual relationships between employees (including faculty) and/or affiliates where one teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates the other in any way unless the person in the position of greater authority or power notifies appropriate University offices (as detailed in Section VII.B.2.a of this policy) and a mitigation plan is put in place that mitigates the conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism. In the event a consensual relationship exists between employees (including faculty) and/or affiliates, the following steps must immediately be followed by the person in the position of greater authority or power:  report the consensual relationship to the appropriate dean and the EVPP (when the relationship involves a faculty member), and/or the appropriate unit head and HR (when the relationship involves a staff member and/or affiliate); report any relationship that currently exists prior to the effective date of this policy to the University offices specified above as soon as possible and cooperate in the development of a mitigation plan as outlined in Section VII.C, below; cooperate in the development of a mitigation plan designed to reduce or eliminate the conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism.   If a consensual relationship exists between employees of the University and one of those employees is presented with the opportunity to teach, manage, supervise, advise, or evaluate the other in any way, the existing relationship must be reported by the individual in the position of greater authority or power to the appropriate University offices designated above as soon as possible and prior to the individual accepting a role that would create a conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism, and a mitigation plan must be developed. Departments and offices that receive reports of consensual relationships as outlined in this policy will notify the applicable VP, Dean, or the EVPP, each of whom will, in turn, notify DIA of the relationship and provide DIA a copy of the mitigation plan for record keeping purposes.  Mitigation Plan If the conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism can be successfully mitigated and managed, a written mitigation plan will be produced within ten (10) business days of the report (unless there are reasonable grounds for additional time) by the appropriate chair, dean, and EVPP (when the relationship involves a faculty member) or the appropriate unit head, DIA, and HR (when the relationship involves a staff member and/or University affiliate) in collaboration with both parties to the consensual relationship. If the mitigation plan is not agreed to by all parties to the plan, resolution of the disagreement will be handled through consultation with the appropriate vice president of the individual(s) opposing the plan and DIA. In the case of a relationship involving individual(s) associated with Intercollegiate Athletics, the consultation will involve the Office of the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and DIA. If the conflict of interest and potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism created by the consensual relationship cannot be successfully mitigated and managed, then the consensual relationship is prohibited. The mitigation plan will:  provide an alternative means for managing, supervising, teaching, evaluating and/or advising of the supervisee or otherwise mitigate the conflict; give priority to the interest of the supervisee; be in writing and signed by both parties to the consensual relationship; provide notice of HOP 3-3031 - Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex Discrimination; and be reassessed on an annual basis (or sooner if circumstances warrant) by the parties, and the applicable department/unit for necessary modification.   ExemptionsExemptions to any of these provisions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will be approved by the Associate Vice President for Investigation and Adjudication, with input from the supervisor(s) of the individual(s) involved.Questions about the application or effect of this policy to an existing or potential relationship should be directed to DIA, HR and/or the EVPP. This policy is not intended to apply to marriage relationships. Refer to HOP 5-1260 - Employment of Close Relatives (Nepotism), for information concerning these types of relationships.  Reporting Alleged ViolationsAn employee (including faculty) or affiliate who is notified, or becomes aware of, an alleged violation of this policy has an obligation to report it timely.  Report Here  Investigation and Discipline Alleged violations of this policy, including concerns of conflicts of interests, favoritism, and/or exploitation will be investigated by DIA in collaboration with the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs. If there is a complaint of sexual harassment/sexual misconduct relating to a relationship covered by this policy, and the relationship has not been disclosed and no Mitigation Plan is in place, the responsibility will be on the person in the position of greater authority or power to explain the failure to comply with this policy. Such failure will be a factor in determining whether the relationship was consensual and free of sexual harassment/misconduct. Disciplinary action against faculty and staff will be handled under the University's policies for discipline and dismissal of faculty and staff. Disciplinary actions may include, but are not limited to, written reprimands, the imposition of conditions, reassignment, suspension, and dismissal. Affiliates in violation of this policy may be disciplined as appropriate under the circumstances. Safe Harbor It is critical the University receive notification of consensual relationships covered by this policy so as to prevent conflicts of interest, favoritism, and exploitation. Unreported consensual relationships pose a significant risk to the University community. With this in mind, if the person in the consensual relationship who is in the position of greater authority or power immediately notifies appropriate University offices of the development of a consensual relationship covered by this policy and cooperates to mitigate the effects of the consensual relationship, then a conduct/discipline investigation may not be pursued. Unreported consensual relationships will be considered more severe violations of this policy.*Note: This safe harbor provision does not apply to potential violations of HOP 3-3031 - Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex Discrimination.  Retaliation ProhibitedRetaliation against a person who reports a potential violation under this policy, assists someone with a report of a violation, or participates in any manner in an investigation or in the resolution of a complaint made under this policy is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. Retaliation includes, but is not limited to threats, intimidation, reprisals and/or adverse actions related to an individual's employment or education. The University will take appropriate steps to assure a person who in good faith reports, complains about, or participates in an investigation pursuant to this policy will not be subjected to retaliation. Individuals who believe they are experiencing retaliation are strongly encouraged to lodge a complaint with DIA and/or UCS.  Counseling Confidential counseling services are available to employees through the Employee Assistance Program at 512-471-3366 and to students through the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center at 512-471-3515.  Forms & Tools The Department of Investigation and Adjudication (DIA) - File a Complaint with DIAUniversity Compliance Services (UCS) - Compliance and Ethics HotlineFor a mitigation plan template, contact DIA: dia@austin.utexas.edu  Frequently Asked QuestionsNone  Related Information University Affiliates HOP 3-3031 Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex DiscriminationFor Employees - Employee Assistance Program For Students - UT Counseling and Mental Health CenterUTS184 Consensual RelationshipsRegents' Rules and Regulations, Rule 30105: Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, and Consensual RelationshipsHOP 3-1022 Protection from Retaliation for Suspected Misconduct Reporting (Whistleblower)HOP 5-1260 Employment of Close Relatives (Nepotism)  HistoryOrigination date: November 1, 2001Modified: January 3, 2017     Editorial Revisions: August 2, 2022     Editorial Revisions: May 31, 2023Previously PM 4.110, HOP 4.A.2

The purpose of this policy is to establish a generally applicable University-wide data privacy standard and to provide interested persons with information about the University’s collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data regardless of the lawful bases under or legitimate purpose for which the information was obtained.  Subject to state and federal law, the University intends for this policy to be compliant with the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The Data Privacy Standard applies to all domains within the University Web and to any other University action or process concerning the collection, processing, analysis and other data processing of personal information regardless of the method by which such information came to be owned and/or controlled by the University.
The University, by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, “University Web”). While this policy applies across campus, some University websites may have additional policies and practices regarding privacy that also must be observed.  The University’s Data Protection Officer in consultation with the Chief Information Officer must approve any such “local” policies prior to the policy’s implementation.
The University’s Web may contain links to third party external websites over which the University has no control.  The University disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of external websites regardless of a link to such websites being displayed on the University Web.
For the purposes of the policy, “processing” means obtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data, including – organization, adaptation or alteration of the information or data, retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data, disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data.  A “data subject” is a phrase that refers to the person to whom the personal data relates.
Each University Web application or site shall contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
‘Personal information’ or ‘personal data’ means any information that relates to or identifies a person as an individual.
6. How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
The University obtains personal information when a person fills out and submits an application to attend or work at the University along with any additional information the person submits to the University before or after they submit an application.  Persons may also provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services.
In addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services, the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University.  As discussed elsewhere in this policy, some University Web (as well as third party’s) webpages use “cookies” to collect information about the web user.  University Web servers (“Web Server”) may also “collect” information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information:
The data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.
Individual data gathered through a specific process, such as the submission of an application to attend the University, related submissions, and subsequent interaction with admissions staff, will only be used for its intended purpose, such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision, or for certain archiving, research, or statistical purposes described below.  Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University.
The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes (“research purposes”).  Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible.  The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject.  The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes.
Further processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University.  Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University’s processes for human subject research, if applicable, and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects.
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited. For example, when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time the person visited the site, a cookie was probably set on their computer; when they return, the cookie is read again. A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed.
University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID. The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web. Normally, a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community. For example, students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.
Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.
Some pages within the utexas.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a utexas.edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party. Specifically, the following code within a utexas.edu page would represent an example of third party content:
<img src="/%3Ca%20href%3D"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" />
In this example, logo.gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas.edu domain (www.other-org.com in this case). Third party content in utexas.edu is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.
The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when a person visits utexas.edu pages that contain third party content, information, such as their IP address, date, browser, and requested page, is transmitted from your computer to that third party.
9. Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
The University processes personal data for a number of reasons, including to meet its contractual obligations, the legitimate conduct of its business operations, and to comply with applicable law.  Sometimes, consent will be the basis for processing personal data.  In these cases, the University will ask the data subject for consent to process their personal data and to share that data with third parties. The processing of personal data provided to the University by a data subject or from authorized third parties, like their high school or a national testing service, enables the University to identify the data subject; engage in processing an application or other submission to the University; or verify information already provided to the University.
The University may also use or disclose personal data for the following statutory or public interest purposes:  to prevent or detect fraud; to monitor equal opportunity; to better serve the needs of students with disabilities with reasonable accommodations; or for research and statistical purposes, the later purpose relying only on aggregate data.
Furthermore, the University processes personal data either necessary for the University to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with a person (e.g. to assess an offer of services to the University) or for the purposes of a legitimate interest of the University pursued by the University (e.g. equal opportunity monitoring).  The University requires persons to provide the University with certain information during the application process in order to assess their application properly except where providing personal information is marked as optional.  Neither admissions nor employment decisions are automated.
Some University Web websites use Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the user visits the site. This information is used to monitor the effectiveness of the website and to consider potential improvements to the website. The information is non-personal and is transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. The University does not share any specific information about a particular user.
Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics terms of use and Google's privacy practices. To opt out of Google’s data collection, read more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
The University does its best to ensure that the personal information it has is accurate. Users with a UT EID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address at UT Direct.
Although no computer system is 100% secure, the University has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.  See Information Resources Use and Security Policy https://security.utexas.edu/policies/irusp#standard12
The University has policies and procedures in place in case of a data breach or some other incident that places information held by the University in jeopardy.  Any individual who believes a data breach has occurred must immediately notify the Chief Information Security Officer, who will investigate the alleged breach and, if necessary, consult with the University’s Data Breach Response Planning Group and the affected department to remediate the breach, including providing any required notices.
Please see the two policies below for the University’s full data breach policies (UT EID Required).
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/incident-management-procedures
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/data-breach-notification-plan
In certain circumstances, the University may be required to provide notice to affected individuals or certain governing authorities if a data breach results in disclosure of personal data.
Several sites within the University Web enable users to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy to only use confidential information that a user enters during a transaction for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.
Except for educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or information made confidential by other law, all information provided to and collected from the University Web, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the University Web, and information collected from University Web-based forms, along with any other form or type of document or other instrument containing personal information, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.  Such information may also, in the legal context, be subject to discovery requests or other legal demand that personal data or information be released and made public.  The same is true for any personal information obtained by the University through other means such as written submission or communications with previous schools or employers.
The University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users.
As well as circulating application and related materials to the appropriate staff at the University and its various departments and colleges, the University will share personal information for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:
In the case of international applicants, the appropriate state and federal agencies;
Immigration authorities in order to act as a person’s sponsor for visa purposes;
Governmental bodies, including local authorities; the Teachers’ Retirement System; UT Workers Compensation; and other agencies or private actors, such as health care providers, that circumstances require be privy to certain personal information
Other Higher Education organizations, in order to assist with tracking and research into access to Higher Education; and
Companies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, the University and/or one or more of its component colleges, schools, department or programs.
Unless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act or otherwise compelled by lawful means, or as a party to a legal action, it is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the University Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences. For example, the University's portal, UT Direct, enables users to customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot be shared with external third parties, unless required by law.
Consistent with FERPA and other applicable privacy law, the University does not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless the University receives explicit written consent, is required to do so by law, or for other legitimate ends of the University.  University students can read more about directory information in the University's General Information Catalog. Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.
The University makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that users disclose in these areas becomes public information, so users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.
Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Canvas, may be logged. However, FERPA generally prohibits disclosure of these educational records.
The University is a research institution. At any time, the University is conducting numerous online surveys on the University Web. It is University policy only to use personal information gathered in these online surveys for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas Public Information Act or as otherwise compelled by law. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
The University will internally share the personal information it receives from applications and other information submitted to the University in accordance with the University’s policy and practice.  Various university staff and faculty may be involved in processing personal data for the purposes for which the University obtained the data.  In some instances, a third-party vendor employed by the University to assist in data processing might process personal data.  Data subjects have the right to be notified of such third party processing of their personal information.
For students, the University will use the details provided on their application, together with any supporting documents or other forms of information that an applicant may provide with their application.  For the purposes of this policy the “application” includes the online application, application fee, an essay, three short answer prompts, your high school transcripts, any college transcripts, test scores, major-specific items, resume, letters of recommendation (not required) and, if applicable, permanent residence card, student information form, course work form and residency affidavit. Different application forms may apply depending on citizen/residency status.
In addition to the application form, the University will use the details in a transcript from every senior college the applicant has attended.  Where the applicant seeks entry into the graduate Accounting and Nursing programs, University will make use of information from an applicants’ transcripts from all junior and/or community colleges attended as well as past test scores.  The individual graduate programs have additional requirements that may require the University to use additional materials.  The same applies to any letters of recommendation that are received.  The University may also rely on personal information that arises from student conduct investigations or hearings.
For faculty and staff, the University will process personal information received in an application for employment or through an interview as well as other means, formal and informal, and maintain records of employees.  For example, a faculty member may wish to participate in certain health care/insurance programs offered by third party vendors, who have a contract with the University to provide such things.  Enrollment in these programs may require sensitive date to be shared with the relevant third party, such as an insurance carrier.  The University will also make use of testing or evaluations to assess various aspects of faculty and staff performance.  Such information could arise as part of a grievance or disciplinary process.
19. What rights do I have related to my personal information?
Data subjects have the right to access the personal information that the University holds about them. Data subjects also have the right to ask the University to correct any inaccurate personal information the University holds about them.  In some cases, data subjects may request that the University delete personal information, request that the University restrict processing their personal information, or object to the University processing their personal information.
There are several laws, including FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) that give data subjects certain rights so far as it pertains to their personal information.
FERPA provides the right to correct one’s personal data and have access to personal information kept about them.  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
Also, as a general rule but subject to certain exceptions, schools must have written permission from the parent or adult student in order to release any part of the student’s education records.
HIPAA provides certain personal data rights to patients who receive healthcare services at covered entities.  The University is a hybrid entity, which means that certain departments at the University, including, but not limited to, University Health Services (“UHS”) and Dell Medical School, are subject to HIPAA.  Each University department that is subject to HIPAA will provide a Notice of Privacy Practices to patients detailing their rights under HIPAA, including their personal data rights.  For example, a data subject may find the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by UHS at the following link: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/privacypractices.pdf.
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives a person the right to be informed about the information that the University collects about them. It also gives a person the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the University correct any of that information that is wrong. Requests to receive and review any of that information, or request corrections to it, may be made by contacting the University's Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box 8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (email: cfo@www.utexas.edu).
The GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect May 25, 2018.  The GDPR’s intent is to regulate the gathering, use and maintenance of personally identifiable information about a natural person and providing certain rights to the data subject, such as the right to erasure and the right to object to the use of personal data.  This law applies to any person, citizen or not, who at the time of the data collection is located in the European Union.  It does not require an entity, like the University, to be located or acting within the EU for jurisdiction to attach; however, a non-EU entity like the University must process personal data related to the offering of goods or services in the EU or to the monitoring of a person’s behavior in the EU for jurisdiction to attach.
You have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information in accordance with all applicable laws. The erasure of your information will be subject to the retention periods of applicable federal and state law and the University’s Record Retention Schedule. If you have provided consent to the use of your information, you have the right to withdraw consent without affecting the lawfulness of the University's use of the information prior to receipt of your request.  A Data Subject may exercise their rights by contacting the University’s Data Protection Officer.
If you feel the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such information, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in the European Union.
The State of Texas and the United States also have laws that address privacy generally and the use of certain types of records, such as educational and health records (described above), that contain personally identifiable information.  Texas has laws that govern records retention and finally, under US/Texas law, the University may have good reason to keep the information despite a conflict with the GDPR.
As a general rule, in cases where Texas or Federal law conflict with the laws of other countries in regard to the processing, use or maintenance of a data subject’s personal information, including provisions of the GDPR, the University will treat Texas and Federal law as controlling.
University employees who receive a request by a Data Subject to have their data forgotten or who have other questions regarding the rights of Data Subjects provided by the GDPR should contact the University’s Data Protection Officer.
The University is an agency of the state of Texas and must follow a records retention schedule, which may be found at: https://financials.utexas.edu/hbp/part-20/2-1-records-management-services-documents.  Generally, the University will keep records of applicants for admission or employment for the following periods of time:
Applicants for admission who do not matriculate into the University: one year after the semester during which an individual applies for admission to the University;
Applicants for admission who matriculate into the University: five years after graduation or the last day of attendance;
Applicants for employment who are not hired: two years from the end of the fiscal year during which the individual applies for employment; and
Applicants for employment who are hired: five years after the end of employment.
Some departments may be subject to other laws that require the department to keep certain personal information for a prescribed period.
Please see the records retention schedule for more information.  The University may update the records retention schedule from time to time.
Students with questions about how their personal information is used, or who wish to exercise any of their rights, may consult this policy and contact the Dean of Students, an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/,  or the office that oversees their primary area of study (major).  They may also contact the Registrar’s office.  https://registrar.utexas.edu/
Faculty may seek assistance from the chair of their department, the Dean of their college or equivalent position, a representative on the Faculty Council or the Provosts’ office or an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
An employee, should contact their immediate supervisor first, and then if necessary proceed up the chain of command.  Employees are also free to contact the Ombuds office https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
For further assistance, please contact University Compliance Services at Compliance@austin.utexas.edu or call 512-232-7055, the University’s Data Protection Officer, Chris Hutto, chris.hutto@austin.utexas.edu, or the appropriate  college, office or department.

On Oct. 25, 2019, students at UT Austin began a series of protests around issues related to how the university publicly reports on and sanctions faculty who have been found to have violated the university’s policies on sexual misconduct.
In response, university leaders began meeting with student leaders to discuss their concerns and took or committed to the following steps:
Formed a campus working group for Title IX and misconduct issues, comprised of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff members, and university leaders.
Hired an external firm, Husch Blackwell, to undertake a comprehensive review of the university’s Title IX and sexual misconduct policies and procedures.
Created a website  to provide further information and regular updates on progress.
Committed the misconduct working group to host a student-led forum in the Spring of 2020 with the participation of university leaders.
Responded to open records requests with a document that summarizes all cases in which faculty and staff have been found in violation of sexual misconduct policies dating back to November 2017. This complements and is consistent with a previously released record summarizing cases from 2013 through most of 2017. Conduct violations are a matter of public record, and when asked, the university has regularly released this information.
Sexual misconduct violates the values and policies of UT Austin. Every individual who serves our university must feel valued, respected and free to learn and work in a safe environment.
UT Austin takes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and investigates them expeditiously. Recently, students have pressed the university to reexamine its approaches.
During the past four months, consultants from the Husch Blackwell firm met with close to 1,500 stakeholders, including UT Austin students, staff and faculty members and led a comprehensive review of the university’s sexual misconduct policies. On March 2, 2020, President Fenves sent a letter to the campus community accepting all of the Husch Blackwell recommendations.  The university will now begin the implementation of these recommendations.

Changing Sexual Misconduct Policies at UT Austin | Office of the President | The University of Texas at Austin
During the past four months, consultants from the Husch Blackwell firm met with UT Austin students, staff members and faculty members and led a comprehensive review of the university’s sexual misconduct policies. The first phase of the review is now complete. Husch Blackwell has presented me with recommended policy changes that are designed to better support survivors, provide clear disciplinary guidelines and improve communication with the campus community.
I have accepted all of these recommendations. We are now beginning the implementation of the recommendations, and you will have opportunities to provide input as part of UT’s procedure for instituting new policies.
When new policies are in place, there will be three major changes:
UT will streamline the resources we offer to survivors to support them effectively.
If any UT faculty or staff member is found — after a thorough investigation — to have committed sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence, the presumptive punishment will be termination. These are the four categories of misconduct included in Texas Senate Bill 212 that require reporting of violations at universities.
If there is a case in which a UT employee is found to have engaged in one of these four types of misconduct and is not terminated because of mitigating factors, that information will be compiled and made publicly available, while preserving the privacy of the survivors.
As we have evaluated our policies in recent months, we have also heard from the campus community about the importance of helping survivors to heal and offering alternative resolutions where appropriate. To accomplish this, we will consult with experts, including those in the Steve Hicks School of Social Work, to introduce restorative justice as an alternative approach.
Sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and interpersonal violence will not be accepted at The University of Texas at Austin. If a faculty or staff member commits these acts, the consequences will be clear. I thank the Misconduct Working Group for their work in recent months, and I am grateful to the students and survivors who participated in our productive forum in January.

UT vows more transparency, harsher punishments in faculty sexual misconduct casesNews Sports Hookem.com Austin360 Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals  FLASH BRIEFINGUT vows more transparency, harsher punishments in faculty sexual misconduct casesLara Kortelkorte@statesman.comAfter months of student protests and an examination by outside experts, the University of Texas on Monday announced it would change its policies around sexual misconduct.The changes are based on recommendations made last week by the law firm Husch Blackwell. For several months, the firm’s consultants have been holding meetings with students and other campus stakeholders to examine ways the university could improve its handling of faculty sexual misconduct.In a letter to the campus Monday, UT President Gregory L. Fenves outlined the policy changes, which include making termination a presumptive punishment for any faculty member found to have committed sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence.For those faculty who are not terminated after such a violation, their names will be compiled and made publicly available, while preserving the privacy of survivors, Fenves said.“Sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and interpersonal violence will not be accepted at The University of Texas at Austin,” Fenves wrote. “If a faculty or staff member commits these acts, the consequences will be clear.”The impetus for the changes was an outcry from students, who in October began publicly protesting the continued employment of several faculty who had violated the school’s sexual misconduct policies. Since then, the university has been working with students and experts to improve its processes and be more transparent.The university and Husch Blackwell consultants debated whether to regularly make a list of punished professors publicly available, out of concerns for survivors. At a meeting with the UT Faculty Council last month, consultant Scott Schneider said no other school across the country releases such a list.But ultimately, the reporting requirements outlined in Senate Bill 212 and Texas’ public information policies warrant a “unique approach,” to these records, Husch Blackwell wrote in its recommendation.“It is worth noting that this practice is not utilized by any of the peer institutions benchmarked for this review,” the report stated. “However, we believe there are unique legal issues in Texas, including the mandatory reporting law and Texas’s robust public information law, that warrant a unique approach.”Other recommendations from Husch Blackwell include streamlining survivor services, making sexual misconduct training mandatory for employees, and implementing restorative justice methods in sex discrimination matters.Consultants found that while the university offered a robust set of support services for survivors, the system was viewed as confusing, not clearly communicated and possibly underutilized. The firm recommended UT make a single office where students can access confidential personnel to provide them support.The firm also recommended UT clearly differentiate between forms of sexual misconduct in its policies, which it said causes confusion about the seriousness of different violations. It recommended the university define each act of misconduct with as much precision as possible.“We recommend that the University clarify that not all violations of its sex discrimination policy are equally egregious — a point that should be emphasized in the definitions themselves as well as the presumptively appropriate sanctions the University metes out for violations of the policy,” the report said.Tasnim Islam, a UT sophomore and one of the leaders of the student-led Coalition Against Sexual Misconduct, said she was ecstatic to read about the recommendations, which are almost identical to the demands made by students last fall. Still, Islam said she and other students are concerned about student involvement going forward.“This issue shouldn’t continue to go on behind closed doors with just experts and administrators,” she said. “Students need to actively be in the room.”Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell / Share / Target My InfoCookie SettingsContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Austin American-Statesman Store Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events© 2023 www.statesman.com.

UT-Austin announces updates to sexual misconduct policies after student protests
The school will make termination the “presumptive punishment” for employees who commit sexual assault or sexual harassment, among other offenses. It will also make available to the public information about those found responsible but not fired for such offenses.
From left: UT-Austin's Greg Fenves, president; Maurie McInnis, provost; and Soncia Reagins-Lilly, vice president for student affairs and dean of students, answered students' questions about campus sexual misconduct policies at an event in January.
The University of Texas at Austin will make termination the “presumptive punishment” for employees who commit sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence, and it will make available to the public information about those not fired for the four offenses.
The planned policy changes come after an external law firm hired to review the flagship’s sexual misconduct-related policies delivered recommendations to UT-Austin President Greg Fenves. He said Monday he accepted all the suggestions — which are “designed to better support survivors, provide clear disciplinary guidelines and improve communication with the campus community” — and that UT would begin implementing them. The announcement comes months after students began protesting that professors punished by UT for sexual misconduct were still teaching undergraduates, and weeks after students condemned the school's handling of sexual misconduct cases at an emotional forum in late January.
Providing information about professors found responsible for misconduct was one of the student protesters’ top demands.
Fenves said Monday that if a university employee engaged in the four categories of misconduct but was not terminated because of “mitigating factors,” information about the case would be “compiled and made publicly available, while preserving the privacy of the survivors.” He said a “thorough investigation” would precede each finding of misconduct.
Fenves also said experts in the Steve Hicks School of Social Work would be consulted about introducing alternative resolution options and restorative justice for sexual misconduct-related matters.
The university fast-tracked the production of the recommendations after the January forum, in which students tearfully recounted being subjected to sexual misconduct or going through the university’s investigative process. Others said administrators had failed the student body and accused administrators of protecting professors with histories of misconduct.
"Why would you be hiding the fact that we're in rooms with sexual predators every time we go to class?" one woman asked at the forum.
Fenves said shortly after the event that the school would hire two additional investigators to help look into misconduct complaints more quickly.
Since the protests began last fall, UT has formed a working group on the subject with students, faculty and administrators. It also hired the external firm, Husch Blackwell, whose lawyers participated in the working group and held several “listening sessions” with various parties on campus.
The lawyers' suggestions include consolidating and expanding confidential resources for students, and adding timelines to encourage quicker resolution of sex discrimination complaints.
UT has released lists of employees found to have violated sexual misconduct-related policies before, but only in response to public information requests. Under pressure from students, the university disclosed in January that 17 employees were found to have violated its sexual misconduct-related policies between November 2017 and December 2019. Three faculty members were on the list. The external firm said in its recommendations that proactively publishing the names of policy violators was "not utilized by any of the peer institutions benchmarked for this review; however, we believe there are unique legal issues in Texas, including the mandatory reporting law and Texas’s robust public information law, that warrant a unique approach.”
The university has previously used a range of sanctions to penalize professors found responsible for sexual misconduct, with the severity of the punishment corresponding with the offense.
Texas A&M University overhauled its sexual misconduct-related policies in 2018 after a review from the same external firm, Husch Blackwell. The school now requires that any employee found responsible for sexual harassment be automatically fired.

Fenves told students at a January town hall that in the past the university made the determination on whether to terminate employment on how much of a safety threat a faculty member presented “based on the facts of the case.”AdvertisementNow, the university will amend its policies to make employee termination the presumptive punishment for those forms of misconduct, Fenves wrote in his email.But the policy change will only affect employees going forward, said Scott Schneider, a partner at Husch Blackwell and a higher education law expert. Making the policy retroactive could open up a flood of past cases and harm survivors who may not want to revisit their cases, Schneider said on Monday.“First off, there are complicated legal reasons why I can't retroactively subject someone to a standard that wasn't in place at the time of misconduct,” he said. “I'm just not convinced from my vantage point that that would serve anyone well.”AdvertisementHusch Blackwell also recommended UT revise its policies to define those forms of misconduct as clearly as possible to address differences between state and federal definitions of harassment and sexual assault to avoid confusion about the severity of incidents.Advertisement“We recommend that the university clarify that not all violations of its sex discrimination policy are equally egregious,” the firm’s report says.If employees are found to have engaged in sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence but are not fired because of mitigating factors, the university will make information about the employees’ misconduct publicly available, while protecting the privacy of survivors. This transparency will not apply to lower-level offenses, Schneider said.Previously, UT only released summaries of employee misconduct through public information requests. But, after some students unknowingly signed up for classes with professors disciplined for sexual misconduct, student protesters demanded the university make the information widely available.AdvertisementThe unprecedented transparency under the new policy will be possible because of Texas’ public information laws and new reporting requirements under a bill passed by the Texas Legislature last year, Schneider said. Senate Bill 212 instituted mandatory reporting of sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and dating violence for Texas universities and their employees.“It’s those two unique aspects that called for what I think is a unique recommendation,” he said.UT will also streamline the resources offered to survivors and introduce a restorative justice program as an alternative approach to resolve incidents. Restorative justice, which focuses on the rehabilitation of offenders through reconciliation with victims and the community, could be utilized when both the complainant and the accused agree to the approach, Schneider said.The firm developed the recommendations, which were submitted to Fenves on Friday, by interviewing roughly 1,500 university members since it was hired in November, Schneider said. In his email, Fenves said he had “accepted all of these recommendations,” which include mandatory employee training on sex discrimination and more prompt resolutions to misconduct cases.AdvertisementSchneider said the firm hopes to finalize policy recommendations by the end of the spring semester.Tasnim Islam, a student organizer in the university’s working group, said she was “overwhelmed with joy” when she saw the policy changes, but she was upset it took the input of a law firm for the university to listen to students’ demands. She said she hopes UT will continue listening to students as the changes are implemented.“We, as student activists, are going to constantly be improving upon our student demands and holding the university accountable in implementing these changes in a timely manner,” she said in a statement.Alyssa Ashcraft, another student organizer, said she wished the recommendations had included adding a question about how safe students feel around professors to the anonymous surveys students take on instructors after each course. But she still celebrated the announcement.Advertisement“I would definitely define today as a victory because we’re getting real policy changes,” she said. “Students made their voices heard, demanded change and got it.”María  Méndez, Politics Reporting Fellow.

UT-Austin to change sexual misconduct policy to terminate, release names of violators – The Daily Texan

UT-Austin to change sexual misconduct policy to terminate, release names of violators
Editor's Note: This story has been updated from an earlier version with additional information about the Husch Blackwell review of UT's sexual misconduct policies.
The University announced substantial changes to its sexual misconduct policies Monday morning. These include a termination policy for UT faculty or employees who are found to have committed certain forms of sex discrimination deemed “unacceptable behaviors,” according to a campuswide email from President Gregory Fenves.
The changes come as a result of a review of UT’s sexual misconduct policies by law firm Husch Blackwell. The firm’s first report was released to the public Monday. Fenves said in the email that the University has accepted all of the firm’s recommendations. He said UT would implement three major changes based on the recommendations: the consolidation of survivor resources, the termination of certain policy violators and the release of the names of employees who violate certain policies.
“If any UT faculty or staff member is found — after a thorough investigation — to have committed sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence, the presumptive punishment will be termination,” Fenves said in the email.
The recommendations only apply to future policy and do not allow the University to retroactively terminate previous policy violators, such as English associate professor Coleman Hutchison and Sahotra Sarkar, integrative biology and philosophy professor, Husch Blackwell attorney Scott Schneider said.
“The default is going to be separation from the institution, as opposed to now where there isn’t a default,” Schneider said.
The report recommends the consideration of unique circumstances in cases where termination may not be necessary. Another recommendation is that the University release the names of employees who violate sexual misconduct policies but are still employed.
Husch Blackwell was hired in November to review the University’s sexual misconduct policies, according to the contract between the law firm and the University. Three lawyers from the firm held stakeholder meetings on campus and worked with the Misconduct Working Group to form their initial recommendations.
The report also recommends the University clearly define sexual misconduct, require sex discrimination training, implement stricter Title IX investigation timelines and consolidate sex discrimination resources into one office. Currently, the University has three offices that deal with sex discrimination cases.
Schneider said there are many resources for survivors on campus, but they were scattered and not well-advertised.
“There’s a marketing problem here,” Schneider said. “There are tons of resources, and I’m not sure that students know about the existing resources. My concern is because of that, they go underutilized.”
Another recommendation the University will implement is working with restorative justice experts, such as those in the Steve Hicks School of Social Work, to offer additional solutions to survivors, Fenves said in the email. Restorative justice programs focus on bringing together offenders and victims to allow for healing and understanding between both parties.
One of the demands of the Coalition Against Sexual Misconduct was the implementation of a restorative justice program.
Schneider said they included this recommendation to create more informal resolution options and help the community affected by a Title IX case.
“When we have one of these cases, not only is the claimant and the respondent impacted, but a whole department can be impacted,” Schneider said. “Using restorative justice principles and vehicles (can) fix harm that the community has experienced.”
According to the report, Husch Blackwell will continue to make other recommendations related to the organization of Title IX compliance offices, the investigation process when upcoming federal regulations are released, the effects of sexual misconduct on third parties and how the University can ensure sanctions remain consistent.

In addition to one professor who had already been publicly identified, the list included two more faculty members, one research fellow and 13 staff members.AdvertisementSeven employees, including three professors, were found to have made inappropriate sexual comments, another four made inappropriate contact and comments. Three employees were found to have engaged in inappropriate contact. One employee stalked a coworker, and one failed to disclose a consensual relationship between her and a subordinate.Political PointsGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.Email AddressBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicySUBMITOne of the professors, Coleman Hutchison, engaged in a consensual relationship with a student, which the university now bars. Hutchison and the other professors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They are all slated to teach during the upcoming semester, according to the university’s course schedule.Ten employees were fired or resigned, according to the summary. The rest received warnings or were given various corrective measures detailed in the summary.AdvertisementPeter Lake, a law professor at Stetson University in Florida and an expert on misconduct in higher education, said the number of incidents was not surprising for a large university, especially in the wake of the broad #MeToo movement against misconduct.“When you have a large university, you’re going to have a lot more HR problems,” Lake said. “It doesn’t surprise me that the number is in that range.”UT has about 3,000 teaching faculty members and 24,000 staff members, including student and seasonal employees, according to spokesman J.B. Bird.AdvertisementBut Merrick Rossein, a professor at the CUNY School of Law in New York, said he thinks 17 violations in the last two years is a “substantial number.”Advertisement“What does surprise me is that many universities do not investigate thoroughly and quickly,” he said, unlike UT in recent years.The summary was released as a university working group reviews sexual misconduct and disclosure policies in response to student concerns. Students held several sit-ins and protests last fall after learning that two professors, Sahotra Sarkar and Hutchison, returned to teaching after being disciplined for sexual misconduct.Students told The Dallas Morning News they signed up for these professors’ courses without knowing their history and have demanded more transparency from UT.AdvertisementThe university has historically disclosed this information through open records requests. It previously released a similar summary listing violations from 2013 to November 2017. That list revealed 11 employee violations, including an investigation into complaints in 2016 that Sarkar made inappropriate comments to students about posing and swimming nude.“Sexual misconduct violates the values and policies of UT Austin,” Bird said in a prepared statement. “Every individual who serves our university must feel valued, respected and free to learn and work in a safe environment. Transparency around past violations, which is mandated by the Texas Public Information Act, is an important step toward accountability.”The working group made up of students, faculty, employees, university leaders and outside experts began reviewing last month whether to proactively share this information with the public.Tasnim Islam, a sophomore on the working group and student protest organizer, said she was surprised the university released the information. She said leaders expressed hesitance after a separate group of students protested at a professor’s house over his writings on sexual relations between men and boys.AdvertisementIslam said that the incidents in the summary, most of which describe complaints of employees making inappropriate sexual comments, give her trepidation about returning to classes this month, but that she’s “relieved” to have the information.“Now I know what parts of campus I feel safer in,” she said.The university is hosting a Jan. 27 town hall with students about the misconduct violations. Islam said she still wants UT to make the information available without people having to file open records requests.“I definitely think that this is a step in the right direction, but I don’t want the university to think that this is going to stop organizers’ efforts,” she said.AdvertisementRead the report here:María  Méndez, Politics Reporting Fellow.

It states that fees from the firm may not exceed $250,000.The university announced Friday that the working group includes six undergraduate students, three graduate students, one post-doctoral student, five faculty members, one staff member, six university leaders and two representatives from Husch Blackwell.

Students protest handling of UT-Austin sexual misconduct cases | The Texas Tribune
Two UT-Austin professors disciplined for sexual misconduct were allowed to resume teaching. Students want to know why.
The incidents have fueled a growing protest movement on campus, with students demanding more transparency in the university's handling of sexual misconduct cases. "We don't know who we're in the classroom  with," one student said.
From left: Lynn Huynh, Shelby Hobohm and Simone Harry paint a banner for an upcoming protest during a meeting of the Coalition Against Sexual Misconduct.
With the end of the fall semester looming, University of Texas at Austin administrators continue to face a burgeoning student protest movement over the return to the classroom of two professors punished for sexual misconduct policy violations.
In the last few months, students have stormed a class, staged sit-ins outside administrators’ offices, circulated a petition and issued a list of demands including public notices naming all professors found to have committed misconduct.
“We don't know who we're in a classroom with,” said one protest organizer, senior Alyssa Ashcraft. “That's the concerning part to students.”
Another sit-in is planned for Friday. Two days ago, UT President Greg Fenves and Executive Vice President and Provost Maurie McInnis agreed to attend a public forum with students next semester, and administrators have met with student organizers several times since the sit-ins began.
Two names in UT’s spring 2020 course catalog spurred the student protests: Associate Professor Coleman Hutchison and Professor Sahotra Sarkar, whose sexual misconduct cases were reported in the media, are scheduled to teach undergraduate courses in January.
Sarkar was suspended for a semester in 2017 after students complained he asked them to pose for nude photos and swim with him at a nude beach and led uncomfortable conversations that were “sexual in nature,” according to UT documents.
Hutchison made “inappropriate remarks” to graduate students and entered into a consensual relationship with one, according to media reports and a summary of a UT investigation. He was banned from supervising graduate students on his own for two years, and his undergraduate courses were later canceled for one semester. Hutchison returned to the classroom this fall; Sarkar returned in the fall of 2017.
Neither Hutchison nor Sarkar responded to requests for comment. Sarkar has disputed the allegations against him in UT documents, and said he complied when an administrator suggested changes in his conduct.
But UT students said it was an unpleasant surprise to learn of the professors’ misconduct history from friends or through social media.
Amanda Brown, a third-year student who took one of Sarkar’s classes this semester, said she learned of his policy violation on Twitter. “You never think that’s going to happen to you,” she said.
A fifth-year student, Candace Kosted, also heard of Sarkar’s case on Twitter and said the information prompted her to drop a research project she had been working on with him.
Although a teaching assistant has been offering a separate session for students enrolled in Sarkar’s course, Kosted said it feels like the university is “accommodating him more than anything by allowing him to keep this job.”
The university has refused to take quick steps to increase transparency, said one protest organizer, sophomore Tasnim Islam, and it did not take the group’s demands seriously until it got press attention.
“School is supposed to be about learning; you’re encouraged to go to office hours,” she said. “You’re encouraged to build relationships with professors.”
UT has hired a law firm to review its policies and swiftly formed a campus working group with students and employees. But protesters say bringing in outside experts is “a step nowhere” that “does nothing to address the immediate concerns that students have.”
Some students would like to see the professors fired or barred from teaching. Others seek less punitive measures, like having staff and faculty undergo more training about sexual misconduct, and requiring the university to publicize information about instructors’ misconduct histories and explain why some are deemed eligible to continue teaching.
In response to open records requests, UT-Austin already releases the names of faculty and employees who violate campus misconduct policies. It also posts sexual misconduct statistics online.
A university spokesperson, Shilpa Bakre, said in a statement that UT has and “will move to terminate faculty and staff members whose violations constitute a safety threat or who engage in violations that warrant termination. The university does so in compliance with our policies, which ensure faculty and staff members receive the required level of due process under federal and state constitutional requirements.”
Not all violations rise to a level that would justify termination, she said. “The type of sanction imposed in a specific situation depends on the facts available at the time, but the intent is for the severity of sanctions imposed to match the severity of the misconduct.”
Employees who have violated school policies in the past are observed, and “ongoing safety assessments are regularly administered,” Bakre said. “Should new allegations of any kind surface, once reported, new investigations will be launched.”
The sit-ins come as universities across the country face continuous scrutiny over how they adjudicate sexual misconduct cases and balance due process rights with protecting student victims. Debates similar to the one playing out at UT have occurred at numerous colleges, testing what offenses should follow instructors throughout their professional careers.
Peter Lake, the director of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University, said there’s been a “crescendo” of institutions facing these quandaries since around 2017, as #MeToo stories made headlines.
“This is territory that is still very contested,” said Lake, regarding whether instructors can “pay the penalty” for certain misconduct offenses and return to campus. “Institutions are caught in the middle of this, trying to balance what to do. There are no clear national standards on this, no obvious objective metric, no standard everyone agrees on.”
While he understands students’ desire to know “if there is a danger lurking and they are unaware,” Lake likened a list of faculty with misconduct histories to a sex offender registry on campus — one that could lead to defamation claims or expand to include other misdeeds, from DUIs to battery, assault and weapons offenses.
UT student protesters said information and rumors about their teachers already spread through whisper networks and that the school could offer accurate facts and context about why certain professors are allowed in the classroom.
A summary of UT’s investigations shows 11 employees were found to have violated sexual misconduct-related policies between 2013 and mid-2017, including Sarkar, the lone professor on the list. Of the remaining employees, four were terminated, three were not rehired and one resigned. UT is expected to release a more current catalogue, spanning mid-2017 to the present, within two weeks to people who submit public information requests.
Bakre, the university spokesperson, said the working group and the external law firm would look into students’ request that policy violators’ names be proactively published, rather than released through the open records process.
UT officials have also committed to posting misconduct statistics more frequently, going beyond the mandates of a new state law that requires universities to publish the information annually.
"UT takes all allegations of misconduct and assessing potential threats to student safety extremely seriously. Our processes surrounding misconduct are thorough, fair, and of the utmost importance to our mission," Bakre said. "We will continue partnering closely with student leadership and other campus stakeholders to find solutions to these issues."

Students demanded more accountability and transparency from the university about faculty who have been found guilty of sexual misconduct  (Juan Figueroa/ The Dallas Morning News)(Juan Figueroa / Staff photographer)By María  Méndez6:00 AM on Dec 1, 2019 CSTLISTENAUSTIN — In October, University of Texas senior Candace Kosted came across a tweet that unnerved her.It said her environmental ethics professor, Sahotra Sarkar, was suspended for a semester in 2017 for a sexual misconduct violation after students complained that he had invited them to go swimming or pose nude.Advertisement“I did have a lot of positive feelings and thoughts toward him before I found out, and then when I heard that news, it was hard,” said Kosted, who is from Pflugerville. “I was just disappointed.”AdvertisementSo when a group of students stormed into Kosted’s class about a week ago to confront Sarkar and ask other students to walk out in protest, Kosted followed.Political PointsGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.Email AddressBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicySUBMITShe and other students who have participated in several campus protests say they want the university to provide a list of all professors with sexual misconduct violations and to remove the professors from courses or fire them.With roughly one week of classes left in the fall semester, they’re growing impatient and frustrated. But experts say meeting students’ demands would break the precedent of how universities traditionally handle sexual misconduct and could challenge federal and state anti-discrimination and privacy regulations.AdvertisementA legal balancing actThe university hired an external firm last month and is finalizing a working group to review its policies in the wake of the actions of Sarkar and English professor Coleman Hutchison, who was disciplined after making sexual comments to students and failing to disclose a consensual relationship with a graduate student. He returned to the classroom this fall.Sarkar and Hutchison did not respond to multiple emails and calls seeking comment.AdvertisementUnder Title IX, universities must respond to reports of sexual misconduct in a “prompt and equitable” manner, said Peter Lake, a law professor at Stetson University in Florida who specializes in the law prohibiting discrimination in education programs.AdvertisementLake said offenses of sexual violence, including rape and assault, generally result in the resignation or firing of university faculty, but consequences for sexual misconduct, such as verbal harassment, historically have not prevented professors from returning to the classroom.Too often, remedies for sexual misconduct have been a “slap on the wrist” that allowed the behavior to spread, said Jerry Carbo, an employment law expert and professor at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania.At UT in spring 2017, Sarkar was suspended from teaching, placed on half-time leave without pay and restricted from advising students.AdvertisementHutchison was barred from supervising graduate students by himself, from consideration for promotion to full professor and from appointment to any administrative or leadership positions for two years. The university also canceled plans for him to teach two undergraduate classes in fall 2018.UT officials told The Dallas Morning News that they do not plan to remove Sarkar or Hutchison from teaching.“The university actively monitors their transition back into their teaching roles and checks to see if new complaints are submitted. Should new allegations of any kind surface, once reported, new investigations will be launched,” UT spokeswoman Shilpa Bakre said in an email.Carbo said UT’s penalties appeared to be “pretty severe” and beyond the typical responses in the private sector.AdvertisementStill, employers in the private sector have been able to respond more quickly or aggressively to demands for accountability because their employees, unlike university professors, don’t have tenure, said Merrick Rossein, a professor at the CUNY School of Law in New York.Bakre said Sarkar and Hutchison’s “status as tenured faculty members did not impact the university’s investigation, response to the alleged misconduct, or the range of sanctions imposed.”But the #MeToo movement ignited a debate over what should be deemed “unforgivable” sexual misconduct offenses, Lake said.Calls for changeWhen Kosted and other students in Sarkar’s class learned about his misconduct, she said, their group chat “started blowing up” and students were confused about how to react.AdvertisementKosted dropped a research project she had started with Sarkar’s help, and Amanda Brown, a junior from Elkhart, stopped attending the class until the teaching assistant began providing separate lectures for students who felt uncomfortable with Sarkar.Brown went to the first of three sit-ins that students organized. She said her goal isn’t to “ruin” Sarkar and Hutchison’s lives, but to promote systemic change against sexual misconduct.“If we don’t say anything, how are we going to stop it from happening in the future?” she said.That’s also why junior Simone Gabriela Harry said she helped organize the third sit-in. The English honors and Black Studies student from South Padre Island said some students realize the university might not agree to identify or fire all professors accused of sexual misconduct, which experts say would be unprecedented.AdvertisementConcerns about the privacy of affected students generally prevent universities from disclosing details about sexual misconduct cases, Lake said.Students are shifting their focus to requesting more transparency about the university’s Title IX and sexual misconduct procedures, Harry said. A petition with some of those demands has over a thousand signatures.“This is about trying to engage with the system of power and trying to undo and prevent more harm within that system,” said junior Lynn Huynh of Houston, another student organizer.The university launched a central website for Title IX reports and students’ questions about sexual misconduct last month and is expected to receive recommendations from the external firm it hired and a university working group in April.AdvertisementSenate Bill 212, which lawmakers passed this year, requires universities to post at least once every fall and spring semester an online report summarizing Title IX cases.UT officials have promised to roll out improved reporting in January, and Bakre said the university will ask the firm to review best practices for disclosing misconduct.Student organizers say that they hope to host a community-led town hall before the semester ends but that administrators would prefer a university-moderated “campus forum.”Bakre said UT is “partnering with students to explore every option available” to productively engage with them.Advertisement“We are focused on creating an environment conducive to a constructive dialogue surrounding issues of misconduct,” she said.CORRECTION, 10:44 a.m. Dec. 2, 2019: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Peter Lake as David Lake and stated that professor Dan Welcher resigned in October.

UT students protest over professors’ reported sexual misconduct allegations
AUSTIN (KXAN) — Dozens of students at the University of Texas at Austin  participated in a sit-in protest outside of Provost Maurie Mclnnis’ office at the university’s main building on Friday.
Students held signs and chanted “We believe survivors” outside of the office doors, demanding that the university be more transparent and accountable when it comes to sexual misconduct violations committed by professors.
This comes after protest organizers say two professors from the College of Liberal Arts were found guilty of sexual misconduct by the university and are still employed to teach undergraduate courses. Students also say that they were not informed by the university about the professors’ reported behavior.
“A lot of the information that we found were from outside sources,” protest organizer Anilya Krishnan said. “The university itself does not have any documentation about these cases.”
A resolution calling for the removal of the two professors was passed yesterday by the Senate of College Councils.
The resolution states English professor, Coleman Hutchinson violated the university sexual misconduct policy by failing to report a relationship with a student. The resolution also says Coleman was charged with making sexual comments to graduate students.
The resolution also lists Integrative Biology and Philosophy professor Sahotra Sarkar. It states that Sarkar violated the university’s Title IX policy after complaints were made of him suggesting students pose for nude photos.
Both of these professors are scheduled to teach multiple courses for the upcoming spring semester.

With registration opening next week, students took to social media warning others not to enroll in those classes.
The university says it was made aware of allegations made against Coleman and Sarkar and took proper action.
“Both professors that were referenced today were thoroughly investigated by UT’s Office for Inclusion and Equity when the allegations surfaced,” UT Communication Strategist Shilpa Bakre said in a statement to KXAN. “The investigations did reveal policy violations. When those findings were  rendered, each of the professors completed the sanctions required for their reinstatement.”
KXAN has filed a public records request to find out exactly what policies were violated and what sanctions the professors completed to be reinstated — but has not yet received those records.
Students at Friday’s sit-in say they want to be informed by the university when professors are found guilty of violating sexual misconduct policies for their own safety.
“Currently if you want information on whether or not a professor has been found guilty of misconduct of any kind, you have to submit a Freedom of Information Act request,” protest organizer Alyssa Ashcraft said. “There is no reason that students shouldn’t have access to that information.”
UT says that it heard student concerns and takes their safety as a top priority.
“We take misconduct seriously and investigate every complaint that is reported,” Bakre said. “We urge students  to report any misconduct that impacts them.”
KXAN has also reached out to both Coleman and Sarkar for comment, but have not heard back yet.

Web Privacy Policy | IT@UT | | The University of Texas at Austin
How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
This document sets forth the Data Privacy Standards of the University of Texas at Austin (“University”) and provides information about the collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data provided to or otherwise collected or processed by the University.
The purpose of this policy is to establish a generally applicable University-wide data privacy standard and to provide interested persons with information about the University’s collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data regardless of the lawful bases under or legitimate purpose for which the information was obtained.  Subject to state and federal law, the University intends for this policy to be compliant with the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The Data Privacy Standard applies to all domains within the University Web and to any other University action or process concerning the collection, processing, analysis and other data processing of personal information regardless of the method by which such information came to be owned and/or controlled by the University.
The University, by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, “University Web”). While this policy applies across campus, some University websites may have additional policies and practices regarding privacy that also must be observed.  The University’s Data Protection Officer in consultation with the Chief Information Officer must approve any such “local” policies prior to the policy’s implementation.
The University’s Web may contain links to third party external websites over which the University has no control.  The University disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of external websites regardless of a link to such websites being displayed on the University Web.
For the purposes of the policy, “processing” means obtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data, including – organization, adaptation or alteration of the information or data, retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data, disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data.  A “data subject” is a phrase that refers to the person to whom the personal data relates.
Each University Web application or site shall contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
‘Personal information’ or ‘personal data’ means any information that relates to or identifies a person as an individual.
6. How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
The University obtains personal information when a person fills out and submits an application to attend or work at the University along with any additional information the person submits to the University before or after they submit an application.  Persons may also provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services.
In addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services, the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University.  As discussed elsewhere in this policy, some University Web (as well as third party’s) webpages use “cookies” to collect information about the web user.  University Web servers (“Web Server”) may also “collect” information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information:
The data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.
Individual data gathered through a specific process, such as the submission of an application to attend the University, related submissions, and subsequent interaction with admissions staff, will only be used for its intended purpose, such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision, or for certain archiving, research, or statistical purposes described below.  Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University.
The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes (“research purposes”).  Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible.  The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject.  The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes.
Further processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University.  Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University’s processes for human subject research, if applicable, and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects.
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited. For example, when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time the person visited the site, a cookie was probably set on their computer; when they return, the cookie is read again. A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed.
University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID. The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web. Normally, a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community. For example, students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.
Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.
Some pages within the utexas.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a utexas.edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party. Specifically, the following code within a utexas.edu page would represent an example of third party content:
<img src="/%3Ca%20href%3D"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" />
In this example, logo.gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas.edu domain (www.other-org.com in this case). Third party content in utexas.edu is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.
The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when a person visits utexas.edu pages that contain third party content, information, such as their IP address, date, browser, and requested page, is transmitted from your computer to that third party.
9. Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
The University processes personal data for a number of reasons, including to meet its contractual obligations, the legitimate conduct of its business operations, and to comply with applicable law.  Sometimes, consent will be the basis for processing personal data.  In these cases, the University will ask the data subject for consent to process their personal data and to share that data with third parties. The processing of personal data provided to the University by a data subject or from authorized third parties, like their high school or a national testing service, enables the University to identify the data subject; engage in processing an application or other submission to the University; or verify information already provided to the University.
The University may also use or disclose personal data for the following statutory or public interest purposes:  to prevent or detect fraud; to monitor equal opportunity; to better serve the needs of students with disabilities with reasonable accommodations; or for research and statistical purposes, the later purpose relying only on aggregate data.
Furthermore, the University processes personal data either necessary for the University to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with a person (e.g. to assess an offer of services to the University) or for the purposes of a legitimate interest of the University pursued by the University (e.g. equal opportunity monitoring).  The University requires persons to provide the University with certain information during the application process in order to assess their application properly except where providing personal information is marked as optional.  Neither admissions nor employment decisions are automated.
Some University Web websites use Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the user visits the site. This information is used to monitor the effectiveness of the website and to consider potential improvements to the website. The information is non-personal and is transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. The University does not share any specific information about a particular user.
Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics terms of use and Google's privacy practices. To opt out of Google’s data collection, read more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
The University does its best to ensure that the personal information it has is accurate. Users with a UT EID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address at UT Direct.
Although no computer system is 100% secure, the University has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.  See Information Resources Use and Security Policy https://security.utexas.edu/policies/irusp#standard12
The University has policies and procedures in place in case of a data breach or some other incident that places information held by the University in jeopardy.  Any individual who believes a data breach has occurred must immediately notify the Chief Information Security Officer, who will investigate the alleged breach and, if necessary, consult with the University’s Data Breach Response Planning Group and the affected department to remediate the breach, including providing any required notices.
Please see the two policies below for the University’s full data breach policies (UT EID Required).
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/incident-management-procedures
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/data-breach-notification-plan
In certain circumstances, the University may be required to provide notice to affected individuals or certain governing authorities if a data breach results in disclosure of personal data.
Several sites within the University Web enable users to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy to only use confidential information that a user enters during a transaction for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.
Except for educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or information made confidential by other law, all information provided to and collected from the University Web, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the University Web, and information collected from University Web-based forms, along with any other form or type of document or other instrument containing personal information, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.  Such information may also, in the legal context, be subject to discovery requests or other legal demand that personal data or information be released and made public.  The same is true for any personal information obtained by the University through other means such as written submission or communications with previous schools or employers.
The University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users.
As well as circulating application and related materials to the appropriate staff at the University and its various departments and colleges, the University will share personal information for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:
In the case of international applicants, the appropriate state and federal agencies;
Immigration authorities in order to act as a person’s sponsor for visa purposes;
Governmental bodies, including local authorities; the Teachers’ Retirement System; UT Workers Compensation; and other agencies or private actors, such as health care providers, that circumstances require be privy to certain personal information
Other Higher Education organizations, in order to assist with tracking and research into access to Higher Education; and
Companies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, the University and/or one or more of its component colleges, schools, department or programs.
Unless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act or otherwise compelled by lawful means, or as a party to a legal action, it is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the University Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences. For example, the University's portal, UT Direct, enables users to customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot be shared with external third parties, unless required by law.
Consistent with FERPA and other applicable privacy law, the University does not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless the University receives explicit written consent, is required to do so by law, or for other legitimate ends of the University.  University students can read more about directory information in the University's General Information Catalog. Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.
The University makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that users disclose in these areas becomes public information, so users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.
Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Canvas, may be logged. However, FERPA generally prohibits disclosure of these educational records.
The University is a research institution. At any time, the University is conducting numerous online surveys on the University Web. It is University policy only to use personal information gathered in these online surveys for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas Public Information Act or as otherwise compelled by law. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
The University will internally share the personal information it receives from applications and other information submitted to the University in accordance with the University’s policy and practice.  Various university staff and faculty may be involved in processing personal data for the purposes for which the University obtained the data.  In some instances, a third-party vendor employed by the University to assist in data processing might process personal data.  Data subjects have the right to be notified of such third party processing of their personal information.
For students, the University will use the details provided on their application, together with any supporting documents or other forms of information that an applicant may provide with their application.  For the purposes of this policy the “application” includes the online application, application fee, an essay, three short answer prompts, your high school transcripts, any college transcripts, test scores, major-specific items, resume, letters of recommendation (not required) and, if applicable, permanent residence card, student information form, course work form and residency affidavit. Different application forms may apply depending on citizen/residency status.
In addition to the application form, the University will use the details in a transcript from every senior college the applicant has attended.  Where the applicant seeks entry into the graduate Accounting and Nursing programs, University will make use of information from an applicants’ transcripts from all junior and/or community colleges attended as well as past test scores.  The individual graduate programs have additional requirements that may require the University to use additional materials.  The same applies to any letters of recommendation that are received.  The University may also rely on personal information that arises from student conduct investigations or hearings.
For faculty and staff, the University will process personal information received in an application for employment or through an interview as well as other means, formal and informal, and maintain records of employees.  For example, a faculty member may wish to participate in certain health care/insurance programs offered by third party vendors, who have a contract with the University to provide such things.  Enrollment in these programs may require sensitive date to be shared with the relevant third party, such as an insurance carrier.  The University will also make use of testing or evaluations to assess various aspects of faculty and staff performance.  Such information could arise as part of a grievance or disciplinary process.
19. What rights do I have related to my personal information?
Data subjects have the right to access the personal information that the University holds about them. Data subjects also have the right to ask the University to correct any inaccurate personal information the University holds about them.  In some cases, data subjects may request that the University delete personal information, request that the University restrict processing their personal information, or object to the University processing their personal information.
There are several laws, including FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) that give data subjects certain rights so far as it pertains to their personal information.
FERPA provides the right to correct one’s personal data and have access to personal information kept about them.  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
Also, as a general rule but subject to certain exceptions, schools must have written permission from the parent or adult student in order to release any part of the student’s education records.
HIPAA provides certain personal data rights to patients who receive healthcare services at covered entities.  The University is a hybrid entity, which means that certain departments at the University, including, but not limited to, University Health Services (“UHS”) and Dell Medical School, are subject to HIPAA.  Each University department that is subject to HIPAA will provide a Notice of Privacy Practices to patients detailing their rights under HIPAA, including their personal data rights.  For example, a data subject may find the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by UHS at the following link: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/privacypractices.pdf.
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives a person the right to be informed about the information that the University collects about them. It also gives a person the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the University correct any of that information that is wrong. Requests to receive and review any of that information, or request corrections to it, may be made by contacting the University's Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box 8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (email: cfo@www.utexas.edu).
The GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect May 25, 2018.  The GDPR’s intent is to regulate the gathering, use and maintenance of personally identifiable information about a natural person and providing certain rights to the data subject, such as the right to erasure and the right to object to the use of personal data.  This law applies to any person, citizen or not, who at the time of the data collection is located in the European Union.  It does not require an entity, like the University, to be located or acting within the EU for jurisdiction to attach; however, a non-EU entity like the University must process personal data related to the offering of goods or services in the EU or to the monitoring of a person’s behavior in the EU for jurisdiction to attach.
You have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information in accordance with all applicable laws. The erasure of your information will be subject to the retention periods of applicable federal and state law and the University’s Record Retention Schedule. If you have provided consent to the use of your information, you have the right to withdraw consent without affecting the lawfulness of the University's use of the information prior to receipt of your request.  A Data Subject may exercise their rights by contacting the University’s Data Protection Officer.
If you feel the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such information, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in the European Union.
The State of Texas and the United States also have laws that address privacy generally and the use of certain types of records, such as educational and health records (described above), that contain personally identifiable information.  Texas has laws that govern records retention and finally, under US/Texas law, the University may have good reason to keep the information despite a conflict with the GDPR.
As a general rule, in cases where Texas or Federal law conflict with the laws of other countries in regard to the processing, use or maintenance of a data subject’s personal information, including provisions of the GDPR, the University will treat Texas and Federal law as controlling.
University employees who receive a request by a Data Subject to have their data forgotten or who have other questions regarding the rights of Data Subjects provided by the GDPR should contact the University’s Data Protection Officer.
The University is an agency of the state of Texas and must follow a records retention schedule, which may be found at: https://financials.utexas.edu/hbp/part-20/2-1-records-management-services-documents.  Generally, the University will keep records of applicants for admission or employment for the following periods of time:
Applicants for admission who do not matriculate into the University: one year after the semester during which an individual applies for admission to the University;
Applicants for admission who matriculate into the University: five years after graduation or the last day of attendance;
Applicants for employment who are not hired: two years from the end of the fiscal year during which the individual applies for employment; and
Applicants for employment who are hired: five years after the end of employment.
