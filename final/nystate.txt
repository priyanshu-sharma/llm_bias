The DOE�s promotion process ensures that students receive the support they need to succeed in the next grade level. For grades Kindergarten through 8, schools review many pieces of student work to determine if students are ready for the next grade level. For grades 9 through 12, schools make promotion decisions based on course credits.Talk to your student�s school about how this process applies to your student if:They have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or;They are an English Language Learner (ELL)Promotion Process and Timeline January � Early FebruarySchools identify students who are not on track to meeting promotion benchmarks at the end of the school year. Families of students whose promotion is in doubt receive an email or written notice in the mail. May � June Schools do promotion portfolios for students who may not be ready for the next grade level This is based on student work and assessments from throughout the school year. Principals make promotion decisions based on the English language arts and math skills shown in the student�s portfolio. Students in grade 8 must also pass the following courses in order to be promoted: EnglishMathSocial studiesScienceFamilies of students who are not promoted are notified by their schools.July Students who were not promoted in June must participate in summer learning.Any student may participate in summer learning, which provides academic support, arts, recreation, and social-emotional support. AugustAt the end of summer, principals make final promotion decisions based on students� portfolios and summer work.Families of students not promoted in June are notified. Families may appeal promotion decisions by submitting a written appeal to their student's principal. How do schools make promotion decisions?Promotion decisions are made by each school principal based on multiple measures of student readiness for the next grade level in English and math (as well as science and social studies for grade 8 students).Teachers review student work from the school year to identify students who may not be ready for the work of the next grade in English language arts and/or math, even with support. Students whose work shows they are ready for the next grade are promoted by the principal in June. If a student's work shows they may not be ready for the next grade level, the teacher completes and scores the portfolio. The principal makes the promotion decision based on the portfolio results. If your student is not promoted in June based on their portfolio results, your student is required to participate in summer learning. At the end of summer, the school reviews the progress of the student, and the principal makes the final promotion decision. How do schools determine which students get promotion portfolios? Schools prepare promotion portfolios for students whose work shows that they may not be ready for the next grade. This can be based on report card grades, student writing samples, projects, assessments, assignments, and other work chosen by the school.Schools do not prepare portfolios for students who show they are prepared for the next grade based on their work throughout the school year. The principal promotes these students in June. What can I do if I am not satisfied with the final promotion decision for my student? If you are not satisfied with the final promotion decision, you may contact the principal of your student's school appealing the decision at the end of August. The appeal will be reviewed by the superintendent, who makes the final decision. What if my student cannot participate in summer learning? Summer learning is an opportunity for students to develop the skills and knowledge needed for the next grade level. At the end of the summer, schools complete a review of students� portfolios with their summer work and assessments. If your student cannot attend summer learning, you may still submit a written appeal to the principal by the end of August but you may find it difficult to demonstrate that your student is prepared for the next grade level.

The goal is to help them see how their actions affect others. For example, your child can:Write a letter apologizing to the student who was bullied.Do a good deed for the person who was bullied or for others in your community.Clean up, repair, or pay for any property they damaged.Speak with their school counselor or administrator.Work with your child�s school if you think additional referrals or resources are needed.Sometimes children bully to fit in. Your child can benefit from participating in positive activities. Involvement in sports and clubs can enable him/her to take leadership roles and make friends without feeling the need to bully.Other times kids act out because something else�issues at home, abuse, stress�is going on in their lives. They also may have been bullied. These kids may be in need of additional support, such as mental health services.

The DOE�s promotion process ensures that students receive the support they need to succeed in the next grade level. For grades Kindergarten through 8, schools review many pieces of student work to determine if students are ready for the next grade level. For grades 9 through 12, schools make promotion decisions based on course credits.Talk to your student�s school about how this process applies to your student if:They have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or;They are an English Language Learner (ELL)Promotion Process and Timeline January � Early FebruarySchools identify students who are not on track to meeting promotion benchmarks at the end of the school year. Families of students whose promotion is in doubt receive an email or written notice in the mail. May � June Schools do promotion portfolios for students who may not be ready for the next grade level This is based on student work and assessments from throughout the school year. Principals make promotion decisions based on the English language arts and math skills shown in the student�s portfolio. Students in grade 8 must also pass the following courses in order to be promoted: EnglishMathSocial studiesScienceFamilies of students who are not promoted are notified by their schools.July Students who were not promoted in June must participate in summer learning.Any student may participate in summer learning, which provides academic support, arts, recreation, and social-emotional support. AugustAt the end of summer, principals make final promotion decisions based on students� portfolios and summer work.Families of students not promoted in June are notified. Families may appeal promotion decisions by submitting a written appeal to their student's principal. How do schools make promotion decisions?Promotion decisions are made by each school principal based on multiple measures of student readiness for the next grade level in English and math (as well as science and social studies for grade 8 students).Teachers review student work from the school year to identify students who may not be ready for the work of the next grade in English language arts and/or math, even with support. Students whose work shows they are ready for the next grade are promoted by the principal in June. If a student's work shows they may not be ready for the next grade level, the teacher completes and scores the portfolio. The principal makes the promotion decision based on the portfolio results. If your student is not promoted in June based on their portfolio results, your student is required to participate in summer learning. At the end of summer, the school reviews the progress of the student, and the principal makes the final promotion decision. How do schools determine which students get promotion portfolios? Schools prepare promotion portfolios for students whose work shows that they may not be ready for the next grade. This can be based on report card grades, student writing samples, projects, assessments, assignments, and other work chosen by the school.Schools do not prepare portfolios for students who show they are prepared for the next grade based on their work throughout the school year. The principal promotes these students in June. What can I do if I am not satisfied with the final promotion decision for my student? If you are not satisfied with the final promotion decision, you may contact the principal of your student's school appealing the decision at the end of August. The appeal will be reviewed by the superintendent, who makes the final decision. What if my student cannot participate in summer learning? Summer learning is an opportunity for students to develop the skills and knowledge needed for the next grade level. At the end of the summer, schools complete a review of students� portfolios with their summer work and assessments. If your student cannot attend summer learning, you may still submit a written appeal to the principal by the end of August but you may find it difficult to demonstrate that your student is prepared for the next grade level.

The goal is to help them see how their actions affect others. For example, your child can:Write a letter apologizing to the student who was bullied.Do a good deed for the person who was bullied or for others in your community.Clean up, repair, or pay for any property they damaged.Speak with their school counselor or administrator.Work with your child�s school if you think additional referrals or resources are needed.Sometimes children bully to fit in. Your child can benefit from participating in positive activities. Involvement in sports and clubs can enable him/her to take leadership roles and make friends without feeling the need to bully.Other times kids act out because something else�issues at home, abuse, stress�is going on in their lives. They also may have been bullied. These kids may be in need of additional support, such as mental health services.

Survivors are in the position of control to decide what happens after an incident of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, occurs.
Schools must respect a survivor�s decision to file, or not to file, a formal complaint and must offer supportive measures either way.
Schools must respond promptly in every instance by offering to provide supportive measures like dorm reassignments or class schedule adjustments
Schools are forbidden from pressuring a survivor into filing or not filing a formal complaint or participating in a grievance process.
To protect younger students, K-12 schools must respond promptly when any school employee has notice of sexual harassment, including sexual assault.
The regulation extends to all aspects of a school�s education program or activity and applies to any building owned or controlled by a student organization recognized by a college or university.
If a survivor chooses to participate in a grievance process, the regulation protects survivors from inappropriately being asked about prior sexual history (also known as �rape shield� protections), and the survivor must not be required to divulge any medical, psychological, or similarly privileged records.
A survivor never has to come face-to-face with the accused during a hearing, and an accused is never allowed to personally ask questions of a survivor.
Survivors are protected against retaliation when they choose to report sexual misconduct or not, file a formal complaint or not, participate in a grievance process or not.
The regulation provides students with a right to written notice of allegations, the right to an advocate, and the right to submit, examine, and challenge evidence.
All students have the right to an impartial finding based on evidence using a standard of evidence � either the preponderance of evidence standard or the clear and convincing standard � that applies to all members of the school community, including faculty.

Imagine you are a college student who believes that campus officials arent taking your sexual harassment complaint seriously. You go to court to seek justice, confident the law is on your side, only to find the court doesnt see your case your way. Or, as one court said in ruling against a plaintiff, You cant always get what you want.
That case, which involved the State University of New York at Stony Brook, is indicative of the hurdle that college students across the nation encounter when they sue campus administrators who they believe have turned a blind eye toward their claim of sexual harassment or assault. This article examines that hurdle at both the New York and national level.
Title IX protects all students in New York at federally funded colleges and universities, whether they are part-time or full-time. It also protects foreign students regardless of race, sex, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation or religion.
New York courts apply the deliberate indifference standard in Title IX claims involving sexual harassment and assault. The Second Circuit has held that a defendant acts with deliberate indifference both when its response to known harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, and when remedial action only follows after a lengthy and unjustified delay.[1] Deliberate indifference must, at a minimum, cause students to undergo harassment or make them liable or vulnerable to it.[2] Only actual notice by an appropriate person who can rectify a violation of Title IX can support a claim under Title IX.[3]
A plaintiff must establish that the school was on actual notice that their specific policies and responses to sexual assault were deficient, and their subsequent failure to remedy these policies was the proximate cause of her sexual assault.[4] In Tubbs, the district court held the plaintiff had not established the university officials acted with deliberate indifference even though the procedures for addressing her complaint were in conflict with a guidance letter from the office of civil rights, which included the university allowing the perpetrator to question directly the complainant.[5] In so holding, the district court crudely stated the following, which underscored the challenges faced by complainants in demonstrating deliberate indifference: Although the court is sympathetic to plaintiffs difficulties, unfortunately, the law in this area repeatedly sings the same tune: You cant always get what you want.[6]
Colleges and universities over the past several years have experienced a plethora of litigation involving student-on-student sexual assaults.[7] The majority of these suits assert Title IX causes of action.[8] Typically, at the college level, a student-complainant alleges that he or she was sexually assaulted by a fellow student-respondent. University investigators determine if the respondent violated school policy. This student-conduct investigation is separate from a criminal investigation. If it is determined by a preponderance of evidence, after a hearing, that the student-respondent violated university policies, sanctions are issued. In most cases, the respondent can appeal the decision at the university level. As of August 14, 2020, under Title IX regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education, attorneys are now allowed to question witnesses at hearings during the investigative process by the university.[9] A complaint of sexual harassment under Title IX may be filed with the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights (OCR), within 180 days of the last act of discrimination. Regardless of the outcome of the OCR complaint, the victim can file a federal lawsuit. Indeed, a victim of sexual harassment can file a Title IX lawsuit without filing with the OCR first. The statute of limitations depends on the state in which the school is located.[10]
Under Title IX, when there is peer-to-peer sexual harassment, to hold a college or university liable, the victim must demonstrate the school acted with deliberate indifference. The United States Supreme Court held in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education[11] that a recipient of federal education funds, such as a college or university, may only be liable for student-on-student harassment where it is a deliberate indifference claim. The crux of these suits is that the university had an official policy of deliberate indifference creating aheightened risk of sexual harassment to the plaintiff.[12] For liability to attach, the university response must be unreasonable and deliberately indifferent; the respondent-student must be found to be under the universitys control; and it must be found that the university had effectively precluded the student-complainant access to an education and had actual notice of the alleged harassment or assault.[13]
After the United States Supreme Court decision in Davis case, the secretary of education amended the regulations implementing Title IX. The amendment adopted, but adapted, the deliberate indifference standard set forth in Davis.[14] Under the amended regulations,[15] a university must provide supportive measures to complainants, which include:
Supportive measuresmeans non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to thecomplainantor therespondentbefore or after the filing of aformal complaintor where noformal complainthas been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipients education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipients educational environment, or detersexual harassment.Supportive measuresmay include counseling, extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus, and other similar measures. The recipient must maintain as confidential anysupportive measuresprovided to thecomplainantorrespondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the recipient to provide thesupportive measures. TheTitle IXCoordinator is responsible for coordinating the effective implementation ofsupportive measures.[16]
If a respondent is found to be responsible for sexual harassment, the recipient (university) must effectively implement remedies for the complainant, designed to restore or preserve the complainants equal educational access, and may impose disciplinary sanctions on the respondent.[17]
The Sixth Circuit in Foster v. Bd. of Regents is a recent Title IX case involving the sexual assault of a student by another student. The court found the University of Michigan was not liable under Title IX because the court concluded the university was not deliberately indifferent.[18]
In Foster, the plaintiff-student was part of an off-site MBA program based in Los Angeles, California. The program occasionally obligated weekend educational sessions at a hotel in the Los Angeles area, requiring students to stay at the hotel overnight on Thursday and Friday. The plaintiff became friends with another student (respondent) in the program. From September 2013 through February 2014, the respondent began expressing his interest in a romantic relationship. On multiple occasions he made unwanted physical contact, including grabbing her butt, rubbing her leg, kissing her forcefully and, more than once, climbing into her bed and attempting to force himself on top of her.[19]
On March 13, 2014, the plaintiff first reported to the universitys Office of Institutional Equity the sexual harassment and assaults. After the initial report, the respondent was only instructed not to have contact with the plaintiff and not to retaliate against her in any way. In addition, the plaintiff and respondent were required to stay at different hotels and respondent could not eat in the same dining room; however, respondent was still allowed to attend class with plaintiff, although he was not allowed to attend social activities. The plaintiff complained the accommodations were not sufficient to address her safety concerns.[20]
On April 3, 2014, during the residency program, the respondent sent a crude email to various university administrators, which referred to the plaintiff as psycho and a lying slut whore. The respondent was allowed to attend class with the plaintiff the next day, despite the email. During the next days breaks, the respondent stood in her way when she exited the class and when she went to get a beverage, and then he blocked her when she tried to go back to her desk. The plaintiff requested that security be called and for the respondent to be disallowed to attend class the next morning. While the respondent did not attend the class the next morning as directed by the university, he sent several classmates messages calling the plaintiff a mean awful person, a wackadoo chick, and stating, my, what a time we had in her bed and mine for a few months there.[21]
After the April residency program, the respondent sent several more emails to university administrators generally criticizing the investigation, using aggressive language and making various demands. For instance, one email said he would be graduating with his class in person. The respondent was barred by the university from commencement and the plaintiff was advised to exercise caution. Despite being barred, respondent flew to Ann Arbor and appeared at a graduation function.[22]
The plaintiff brought a lawsuit under Title IX, which was dismissed on summary judgment by the court, which held the university responded promptly, compassionately, and effectively to Fosters complaints. The plaintiff appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit, who initially reversed the summary judgment,[23] but after a rehearing en banc, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court.
The Sixth Circuit held that to prevail in a Title IX action, the victim must establish the school was deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of which [it had] actual knowledge, that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.[24] The Sixth Circuit relied on the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Ed, which held a schools response to sexual harassment is deliberatively indifferent if it is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.[25] The standard neither requires that the school purge its school of actionable peer harassment nor does it require courts to conclude that minimal, ineffective, or belated efforts to respond to sexual harassment are not clearly unreasonable as a matter of law.[26]
In Foster, the Sixth Circuit did not find that the school engaged in deliberate indifference despite inadequate and ineffective action by the school once it knew about the sexual harassment and assault. The university knew that the initial no-contact order to the respondent was violated when the respondent texted Really and when the university got the erratic email calling the plaintiff names. Afterwards, the plaintiff detailed an escalating campaign of harassment by the respondent and ineffective responses by the university. Instead of the court finding there was a factual dispute for the jury regarding whether the university engaged in deliberate indifference, the court dismissed the plaintiffs action, finding as a matter of law that the university did not engage in deliberate indifference. By doing so, the court created an unreasonably high bar for a plaintiff-victim to meet in instances of sexual harassment by another peer on campus, even when it includes sexual assault. The egregious nature of the harassment should demand swift, serious disciplinary action against the student-perpetrator.[27] However, under the deliberate indifference standard, the court has removed a factfinders ability to review the effectiveness of the universitys action, thereby failing to address adequately the sexual harassment, and making the victim vulnerable, as in Foster, to further harm and retaliation.
Following Davis, the Circuits have been divided on what is necessary to find a school subjected a student to discrimination under the deliberate indifference standard.[28] The First, Tenth and Eleventh Circuits read this language to mean that students must demonstrate only that a schools deliberate indifference made harassment more likely, not that it actually led to any additional post-notice incidences of harassment.[29] To prevail in actions against public schools where peer-on-peer harassment occurs by overcoming the deliberate indifference standard, courts have found the following to be relevant: reasonableness of the schools response, control by the school over context and the respondent, and notice of the alleged harassment or assault. The Tenth Circuit found that a university was liable under Title IX, where its deliberate indifference to reports by students of rape caused the victims to be more vulnerable to sexual harassment.[30] In the Tenth Circuit case, the plaintiffs alleged that the universitys deliberate indifference caused them to have to continue attending school with the student-rapists, who were then potentially emboldened, causing the plaintiffs to withdraw from participation in educational opportunities because of fear of encountering the unchecked student-rapists and other students who knew of the rapes.
In a case out of the Eastern District of Michigan, the Hon. Terrence G. Berg found the student plaintiffs had a claim under Title IX because the schools deliberate indifference left the students more vulnerable to future abuse.[31] In that case, respondent sexually touched the victim at school on numerous occasions (both 12 and 13 years old at the time and receiving special education services); despite this, the school wanted to place the victim back in the same classroom as the respondent, which exposed the victim to the same risk of abuse. In a subsequent decision out of the Sixth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit reaffirmed the standard for overcoming deliberate indifference in that Circuit required a showing of additional harassment.[32] In Kollaritsch, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district courts ruling denying the universitys motion to dismiss in a Title IX case involving student-on-student sexual harassment. The court found the sexual harassment was not pervasive enough and found there was no additional harassment after the university took action. The case involved reports by four female students who were sexually assaulted by male students. The four female students sued Michigan State Universitys administration because they believed the administration responded inadequately to the complaints. After their complaints, the complainants encountered their perpetrator several times. The Sixth Circuit found that, to hold a university liable for deliberate indifference,
the plaintiff must plead, and ultimately prove, an incident ofactionable sexual harassment, the schools actual knowledge of it, some further incident of actionable sexual harassment, that the further actionable harassment would not have happened but for the objective unreasonableness (deliberate indifference)of the schools response, and that the Title IX injury is attributable to the post-actual-knowledge further harassment.[33]
In a Fourth Circuit case, the court found there was deliberate indifference in a Title IX claim brought by a campus feminist group who were being sexually harassed through online posts on a university-maintained social media site.[34] The court found the university acted with deliberate indifference because its efforts were not reasonably calculated to end the harassment since it only created two listening circles, a generic email and, on one occasion, sent campus police to be with a threatened student.
In Karaseck v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal.,[35] the Ninth Circuit held deliberate indifference can be found in a pre-assault claim in order to survive a motion to dismiss, when the following is shown: (1) a school maintained a policy of deliberate indifference to reports of sexual misconduct; (2) which created a heightened risk of sexual harassment; (3) in a context subject to the schools control; and (4) the plaintiff was harassed as a result. The court found that actual knowledge or acting with deliberate indifference to a particular incident of harassment was not necessary for a pre-assault claim if the four elements were established. The court found persuasive a report issued by the state auditor finding the mishandling of complaints was putting students at risk and the universitys failure to address those concerns adequately.
A bevy of student-complainants in federal court are asserting aheightened risk claimunder Title IX, alleging that institutions had an official policy of deliberate indifference to reports of sexual misconduct. Thus, the plaintiff was harassed as a result. A university that receives federal funds may be liable for its response to student-on-student sexual harassment or assault. However,actual notice and deliberate indifference by the university must be proven for liability to attach constituting intentional Title IX violation.
Title IX protects all students in New York at federally funded colleges and universities, whether they are part-time or full-time. It also protects foreign students regardless of race, sex, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation or religion. New York courts apply the deliberate indifference standard in Title IX claims involving sexual harassment and assault.
The U.S. Department of Education regulations, effective August 14, 2020, set out university procedures in cases involving student-on-student sexual assault.[36] Also, attorneys are now permitted to question witnesses at university hearings and in some cases conduct cross examination.
It is important that counsel read the cases in his or her jurisdiction to glean the application of Title IX litigation. This area of law is developing rapidly.

Imagine you are a college student who believes that campus officials arent taking your sexual harassment complaint seriously. You go to court to seek justice, confident the law is on your side, only to find the court doesnt see your case your way. Or, as one court said in ruling against a plaintiff, You cant always get what you want.
That case, which involved the State University of New York at Stony Brook, is indicative of the hurdle that college students across the nation encounter when they sue campus administrators who they believe have turned a blind eye toward their claim of sexual harassment or assault. This article examines that hurdle at both the New York and national level.
Title IX protects all students in New York at federally funded colleges and universities, whether they are part-time or full-time. It also protects foreign students regardless of race, sex, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation or religion.
New York courts apply the deliberate indifference standard in Title IX claims involving sexual harassment and assault. The Second Circuit has held that a defendant acts with deliberate indifference both when its response to known harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, and when remedial action only follows after a lengthy and unjustified delay.[1] Deliberate indifference must, at a minimum, cause students to undergo harassment or make them liable or vulnerable to it.[2] Only actual notice by an appropriate person who can rectify a violation of Title IX can support a claim under Title IX.[3]
A plaintiff must establish that the school was on actual notice that their specific policies and responses to sexual assault were deficient, and their subsequent failure to remedy these policies was the proximate cause of her sexual assault.[4] In Tubbs, the district court held the plaintiff had not established the university officials acted with deliberate indifference even though the procedures for addressing her complaint were in conflict with a guidance letter from the office of civil rights, which included the university allowing the perpetrator to question directly the complainant.[5] In so holding, the district court crudely stated the following, which underscored the challenges faced by complainants in demonstrating deliberate indifference: Although the court is sympathetic to plaintiffs difficulties, unfortunately, the law in this area repeatedly sings the same tune: You cant always get what you want.[6]
Colleges and universities over the past several years have experienced a plethora of litigation involving student-on-student sexual assaults.[7] The majority of these suits assert Title IX causes of action.[8] Typically, at the college level, a student-complainant alleges that he or she was sexually assaulted by a fellow student-respondent. University investigators determine if the respondent violated school policy. This student-conduct investigation is separate from a criminal investigation. If it is determined by a preponderance of evidence, after a hearing, that the student-respondent violated university policies, sanctions are issued. In most cases, the respondent can appeal the decision at the university level. As of August 14, 2020, under Title IX regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education, attorneys are now allowed to question witnesses at hearings during the investigative process by the university.[9] A complaint of sexual harassment under Title IX may be filed with the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights (OCR), within 180 days of the last act of discrimination. Regardless of the outcome of the OCR complaint, the victim can file a federal lawsuit. Indeed, a victim of sexual harassment can file a Title IX lawsuit without filing with the OCR first. The statute of limitations depends on the state in which the school is located.[10]
Under Title IX, when there is peer-to-peer sexual harassment, to hold a college or university liable, the victim must demonstrate the school acted with deliberate indifference. The United States Supreme Court held in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education[11] that a recipient of federal education funds, such as a college or university, may only be liable for student-on-student harassment where it is a deliberate indifference claim. The crux of these suits is that the university had an official policy of deliberate indifference creating aheightened risk of sexual harassment to the plaintiff.[12] For liability to attach, the university response must be unreasonable and deliberately indifferent; the respondent-student must be found to be under the universitys control; and it must be found that the university had effectively precluded the student-complainant access to an education and had actual notice of the alleged harassment or assault.[13]
After the United States Supreme Court decision in Davis case, the secretary of education amended the regulations implementing Title IX. The amendment adopted, but adapted, the deliberate indifference standard set forth in Davis.[14] Under the amended regulations,[15] a university must provide supportive measures to complainants, which include:
Supportive measuresmeans non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to thecomplainantor therespondentbefore or after the filing of aformal complaintor where noformal complainthas been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipients education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipients educational environment, or detersexual harassment.Supportive measuresmay include counseling, extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus, and other similar measures. The recipient must maintain as confidential anysupportive measuresprovided to thecomplainantorrespondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the recipient to provide thesupportive measures. TheTitle IXCoordinator is responsible for coordinating the effective implementation ofsupportive measures.[16]
If a respondent is found to be responsible for sexual harassment, the recipient (university) must effectively implement remedies for the complainant, designed to restore or preserve the complainants equal educational access, and may impose disciplinary sanctions on the respondent.[17]
The Sixth Circuit in Foster v. Bd. of Regents is a recent Title IX case involving the sexual assault of a student by another student. The court found the University of Michigan was not liable under Title IX because the court concluded the university was not deliberately indifferent.[18]
In Foster, the plaintiff-student was part of an off-site MBA program based in Los Angeles, California. The program occasionally obligated weekend educational sessions at a hotel in the Los Angeles area, requiring students to stay at the hotel overnight on Thursday and Friday. The plaintiff became friends with another student (respondent) in the program. From September 2013 through February 2014, the respondent began expressing his interest in a romantic relationship. On multiple occasions he made unwanted physical contact, including grabbing her butt, rubbing her leg, kissing her forcefully and, more than once, climbing into her bed and attempting to force himself on top of her.[19]
On March 13, 2014, the plaintiff first reported to the universitys Office of Institutional Equity the sexual harassment and assaults. After the initial report, the respondent was only instructed not to have contact with the plaintiff and not to retaliate against her in any way. In addition, the plaintiff and respondent were required to stay at different hotels and respondent could not eat in the same dining room; however, respondent was still allowed to attend class with plaintiff, although he was not allowed to attend social activities. The plaintiff complained the accommodations were not sufficient to address her safety concerns.[20]
On April 3, 2014, during the residency program, the respondent sent a crude email to various university administrators, which referred to the plaintiff as psycho and a lying slut whore. The respondent was allowed to attend class with the plaintiff the next day, despite the email. During the next days breaks, the respondent stood in her way when she exited the class and when she went to get a beverage, and then he blocked her when she tried to go back to her desk. The plaintiff requested that security be called and for the respondent to be disallowed to attend class the next morning. While the respondent did not attend the class the next morning as directed by the university, he sent several classmates messages calling the plaintiff a mean awful person, a wackadoo chick, and stating, my, what a time we had in her bed and mine for a few months there.[21]
After the April residency program, the respondent sent several more emails to university administrators generally criticizing the investigation, using aggressive language and making various demands. For instance, one email said he would be graduating with his class in person. The respondent was barred by the university from commencement and the plaintiff was advised to exercise caution. Despite being barred, respondent flew to Ann Arbor and appeared at a graduation function.[22]
The plaintiff brought a lawsuit under Title IX, which was dismissed on summary judgment by the court, which held the university responded promptly, compassionately, and effectively to Fosters complaints. The plaintiff appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit, who initially reversed the summary judgment,[23] but after a rehearing en banc, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court.
The Sixth Circuit held that to prevail in a Title IX action, the victim must establish the school was deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of which [it had] actual knowledge, that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.[24] The Sixth Circuit relied on the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Ed, which held a schools response to sexual harassment is deliberatively indifferent if it is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.[25] The standard neither requires that the school purge its school of actionable peer harassment nor does it require courts to conclude that minimal, ineffective, or belated efforts to respond to sexual harassment are not clearly unreasonable as a matter of law.[26]
In Foster, the Sixth Circuit did not find that the school engaged in deliberate indifference despite inadequate and ineffective action by the school once it knew about the sexual harassment and assault. The university knew that the initial no-contact order to the respondent was violated when the respondent texted Really and when the university got the erratic email calling the plaintiff names. Afterwards, the plaintiff detailed an escalating campaign of harassment by the respondent and ineffective responses by the university. Instead of the court finding there was a factual dispute for the jury regarding whether the university engaged in deliberate indifference, the court dismissed the plaintiffs action, finding as a matter of law that the university did not engage in deliberate indifference. By doing so, the court created an unreasonably high bar for a plaintiff-victim to meet in instances of sexual harassment by another peer on campus, even when it includes sexual assault. The egregious nature of the harassment should demand swift, serious disciplinary action against the student-perpetrator.[27] However, under the deliberate indifference standard, the court has removed a factfinders ability to review the effectiveness of the universitys action, thereby failing to address adequately the sexual harassment, and making the victim vulnerable, as in Foster, to further harm and retaliation.
Following Davis, the Circuits have been divided on what is necessary to find a school subjected a student to discrimination under the deliberate indifference standard.[28] The First, Tenth and Eleventh Circuits read this language to mean that students must demonstrate only that a schools deliberate indifference made harassment more likely, not that it actually led to any additional post-notice incidences of harassment.[29] To prevail in actions against public schools where peer-on-peer harassment occurs by overcoming the deliberate indifference standard, courts have found the following to be relevant: reasonableness of the schools response, control by the school over context and the respondent, and notice of the alleged harassment or assault. The Tenth Circuit found that a university was liable under Title IX, where its deliberate indifference to reports by students of rape caused the victims to be more vulnerable to sexual harassment.[30] In the Tenth Circuit case, the plaintiffs alleged that the universitys deliberate indifference caused them to have to continue attending school with the student-rapists, who were then potentially emboldened, causing the plaintiffs to withdraw from participation in educational opportunities because of fear of encountering the unchecked student-rapists and other students who knew of the rapes.
In a case out of the Eastern District of Michigan, the Hon. Terrence G. Berg found the student plaintiffs had a claim under Title IX because the schools deliberate indifference left the students more vulnerable to future abuse.[31] In that case, respondent sexually touched the victim at school on numerous occasions (both 12 and 13 years old at the time and receiving special education services); despite this, the school wanted to place the victim back in the same classroom as the respondent, which exposed the victim to the same risk of abuse. In a subsequent decision out of the Sixth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit reaffirmed the standard for overcoming deliberate indifference in that Circuit required a showing of additional harassment.[32] In Kollaritsch, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district courts ruling denying the universitys motion to dismiss in a Title IX case involving student-on-student sexual harassment. The court found the sexual harassment was not pervasive enough and found there was no additional harassment after the university took action. The case involved reports by four female students who were sexually assaulted by male students. The four female students sued Michigan State Universitys administration because they believed the administration responded inadequately to the complaints. After their complaints, the complainants encountered their perpetrator several times. The Sixth Circuit found that, to hold a university liable for deliberate indifference,
the plaintiff must plead, and ultimately prove, an incident ofactionable sexual harassment, the schools actual knowledge of it, some further incident of actionable sexual harassment, that the further actionable harassment would not have happened but for the objective unreasonableness (deliberate indifference)of the schools response, and that the Title IX injury is attributable to the post-actual-knowledge further harassment.[33]
In a Fourth Circuit case, the court found there was deliberate indifference in a Title IX claim brought by a campus feminist group who were being sexually harassed through online posts on a university-maintained social media site.[34] The court found the university acted with deliberate indifference because its efforts were not reasonably calculated to end the harassment since it only created two listening circles, a generic email and, on one occasion, sent campus police to be with a threatened student.
In Karaseck v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal.,[35] the Ninth Circuit held deliberate indifference can be found in a pre-assault claim in order to survive a motion to dismiss, when the following is shown: (1) a school maintained a policy of deliberate indifference to reports of sexual misconduct; (2) which created a heightened risk of sexual harassment; (3) in a context subject to the schools control; and (4) the plaintiff was harassed as a result. The court found that actual knowledge or acting with deliberate indifference to a particular incident of harassment was not necessary for a pre-assault claim if the four elements were established. The court found persuasive a report issued by the state auditor finding the mishandling of complaints was putting students at risk and the universitys failure to address those concerns adequately.
A bevy of student-complainants in federal court are asserting aheightened risk claimunder Title IX, alleging that institutions had an official policy of deliberate indifference to reports of sexual misconduct. Thus, the plaintiff was harassed as a result. A university that receives federal funds may be liable for its response to student-on-student sexual harassment or assault. However,actual notice and deliberate indifference by the university must be proven for liability to attach constituting intentional Title IX violation.
Title IX protects all students in New York at federally funded colleges and universities, whether they are part-time or full-time. It also protects foreign students regardless of race, sex, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation or religion. New York courts apply the deliberate indifference standard in Title IX claims involving sexual harassment and assault.
The U.S. Department of Education regulations, effective August 14, 2020, set out university procedures in cases involving student-on-student sexual assault.[36] Also, attorneys are now permitted to question witnesses at university hearings and in some cases conduct cross examination.
It is important that counsel read the cases in his or her jurisdiction to glean the application of Title IX litigation. This area of law is developing rapidly.

The Hollis Salzman Womens Leadership Fellowship has been established by the New York State Bar Associations Antitrust Section to honor the memory of Hollis Salzman (1965-2020). Hollis was a pre-eminent antitrust attorney and long-time member of the NYSBA Antitrust Section, serving on its Executive Committee, and as Secretary, Vice Chair, and finally Chair of the Section in 2020. Holliss leadership of, and many contributions to, the Antitrust Section helped it become a stronger, more vibrant, and more inclusive organization. In addition to her impressive professional career, Hollis is remembered as a leader who devoted significant time and energy to mentoring younger lawyers  particularly women lawyers. She campaigned for recognition of the accomplishments of women lawyers within law firms and other organizations and for women to hold leadership positions in significant litigations.
The Fellowship is designed to support and promote women antitrust lawyers who are in the mid-stage of their careers and seeking to move to the next level. This is an underserved group: while there are several opportunities and programs aimed at law students and very junior lawyers, limited resources and attention have been directed towards promoting women with several years of practice and supporting their advancement to a more senior level of the profession. This is the first program supported by the Antitrust Section that is aimed specifically at developing women in antitrust.
One Fellow will be selected bi-annually to attend a high-level leadership program aimed at developing and enabling women lawyers to move to the next level of their careers. For 2024, the Section has chosen the Harvard Law Schools Womens Leadership Initiative, which has held a seat in its 2024 in-person program for our Fellow. The Fellowship will cover course fees for the program, which includes tuition, course materials, accommodations, and most meals.
The Fellow will be expected to provide input to the Section on the program, serve as a mentor in the Sections mentoring program, and participate in Antitrust Section events and other activities.
Applications for the 2024 Fellowship are open to women lawyers (including individuals who consistently live and self-identify as women, regardless of their gender assignment at birth) practicing antitrust law in New York State in their 7th to 13th year of practice post law-school. More senior applicants may also be considered on a case-by-case basis. Applicants must also be members of the NYSBA Antitrust Section.
The Fellow will be selected by a committee formed by the Antitrust Section. Following review of applications and an interview with the Fellowship Committee, the winning Fellow will be notified in mid-December and will be recognized at the Antitrust Sections Annual Meeting in January 2024. The Fellow will attend the Harvard Law School Womens Leadership Initiative program on January 30-February 2, 2024.
Applications must be submitted by Friday November 3, 2023. Applications must be submitted by email to: [emailprotected]. Please include Hollis Salzman Fellowship in the subject line.
For questions or further information about the program, please contact Barbara Hart at [emailprotected].

Elder Memo 9  Comments Opposing any Imposition of a Lookback for Home and Community Based Waivered Services
The Elder Law and Special Needs Section encourages law students, through an elder law clinic experience, to learn about important legislative developments, regulations, and case laws impacting the elderly and disabled and to provide representation to those clients struggling with a variety of legal issues and problems related to aging and incapacity.
Through the scholarship, the Section aspires to advance opportunities for the disabled by implementing a preference for awarding the scholarship to a student who demonstrates a present and permanent physical or mental disability that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual.
The ultimate goal of the scholarship is to create a network and cultivate relationships among lawyers whose practice focuses on elder law and special needs planning and law students planning to practice in these areas to encourage the practice of elder law and special needs planning among lawyers throughout the State of New York.
The Section is pleased to offer this Scholarship in honor of former Section Chair, T. David Stapleton. The scholarship, with a value of $2,500, will be awarded to a second year (2L) or third year (3L) law student who is enrolled in a law school in the State of New York in one of the following regions: Central New York, Finger Lakes, Southern Tier and Western New York who has a demonstrated interest in the Elder Law and Special Needs practice areas and/or a law student that is from this region, studying at a law school outside the region who has clear plans to return to the region to practice Elder Law.
T. David Stapleton practiced in Auburn, NY and served as NYSBA Elder Law & Special Needs Section Chair from 2011-2012, after having followed the officer track and being involved in leadership within the Section leading up to such role. David not only led as a tremendous lawyer, he advocated for upstate involvement, sought to expand our knowledge of literature by peppering almost every writing and conversation with a poignant quote, encouraged a healthy lifestyle through diet and exercise and demonstrated the importance of family, friends, and camaraderie among lawyers.
Davids signature issue during his tenure as Chair was the expansion and rescinding of expanded Medicaid estate recovery. Some will recall his having mentioned that while he understood the underlying concept of the state in seeking to expand recovery options, he truly believed the powers-that-be did not appreciate the devastating impact it would have on the little folks who would lose even modest inheritances if the expansion was carried out.
While not diminutive in stature, David always diminished his breadth of knowledge of the law, often calling himself a small, upstate lawyer. It is our honor to offer this scholarship in Davids memory to another potential small, upstate lawyer.
The Elder Law and Special Needs Mentor Program his program pairs an experienced elder law attorney with a Section member new to the practice of elder law for the coming year. The term is for one year, commencing April 30th and ending May 1st. The mentoring program will provide

Opportunities to work together on section programs, reports and events that will enhance careers and the profession.

Section Committee Chairs are poised to welcome mentor/mentee pairs to work together on committee projects, reports, events, etc. As for ad hoc opportunities, we look forward to seeing what pairs produce, and to learning from one another. We plan that there will be at least one communication per month, whether in person, by telephone or email, to keep continuity and maximize the value to the participants.
7 matches for Mentees living or practicing in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Judicial Districts.
While we are hoping to accommodate as many pairings as possible, in the event we receive more requests for Mentees than we have available Mentors, selection of Mentees will be made randomly.
If you are interested in applying to be a Mentoror Mentee, please fill out the appropriate form below and email tothe Mentorship Committee Co-Chairs, Miles Zatkowsky

The New York State Bar Association (NYSBA) established the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law Section in 1945 as one of the first sections of the NYSBA.
The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law Section was formed in 1945 following enactment of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the Act). This NYSBA section was the first of its kind in the nation, serving as the forum for those experts in this field in the private and public sectors. The Chair cited the importance of the increasing the bars knowledge of the Act, the work of the Food and Drug Administration, the intended consumer benefits, and the enhancement of technical and ethical standards of industries involved.
The action of the Association, setting up a Section on Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law, is worthy of special notice not only as this is the first Section of its kind, but also because it will tend to give this branch of law the prestige, the dignity, and the attention which it so clearly merits.  Charles Wesley Dunn, first Chair, on the creation of the Section.
In addition to food, drug, and cosmetic issues, committees were also created on related fields of practice. Within several years of creation, the Section successfully urged creation of a Food and Drug Committee within the Administrative Law Section of the American Bar Association. Over the years, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law Sections committees have evolved to meet the times.
In its first year, the Section began professional education programs continued today on legislative and administrative developments, ramifications of amendments to the Act, enforcement procedures, approval and marketing in interstate commerce, advertising compliance, and product liability issues. The focal point for the Sections professional education has always remained the NYSBAs Annual Meeting, supplemented with specialty topics and events throughout the year.

Carol Van Scoyoc was an extraordinarily gifted lawyer who dedicated her career to public service. An icon of the profession, Ms. Van Scoyoc represented the highest standards for excellence in the practice of law, ethical conduct and dedication to the public good that all lawyers aspire to. Ms. Van Scoyoc passed away in 2017 at the age of 56 after a long, courageous battle with cancer.
Born in 1960, Ms. Van Scoyoc was a summa cum laude graduate of Manhattan College, where she served as the first woman president of the St. Thomas More Law Society, and received a JD from Pace University Law School. She began her legal career in the Westchester County Attorneys Office, rising to the position of Assistant Chief Deputy County Attorney. During her ten year tenure, she served as counsel in over 150 reported cases, including In the Matter of Westchester County Medical Center (Mary OConnor) 72 N.Y. 2d 517 (1988), a landmark Court of Appeals decision that resulted in major changes to New Yorks health care proxy forms in order to protect the mentally incapacitated. In another highly significant matter, U.S. v. ORourke, 943 F.2d 180 (2d. Cir. 1991), Ms. Van Scoyoc saved Westchester County taxpayers $5,000,000 when she successfully argued that the County had complied with its agreement to close the Croton Landfill because of pollution to the Hudson River. Beginning in 1995, for 22 years until her death, Ms. Van Scoyoc served as the Chief Deputy Corporation Counsel for the City of White Plains where her consummate research, drafting and litigation skills helped mold and shape the landscape of the City during a construction boom.
A leader and role model to the bar, in 2011 Ms. Van Scoyoc was elected as only the third woman President of the Westchester County Bar Association in its 115 year history. She also served as Chair of the Municipal Law Section of the Westchester County Bar Association and was the Editor in Chief of the Westchester County Bar Journal. At the time of her passing, Ms. Van Scoyoc was serving as Chair of the Local and State Government Law Section of the New York State Bar Association, having previously served for many years on the Sections Executive Committee. In 2012, Ms. Van Scoyoc received the Award for Excellence in Public Service presented by the New York State Bar Association Committee on Attorneys in Public Service.
Committed to training the next generation of public officials, for 15 years Ms. Van Scoyoc served as an Adjunct Professor at the Pace Graduate School of Public Administration. Hundreds of graduate students benefitted from Ms. Van Scoyocs knowledge, passion, and unwavering commitment to public service.
Ms. Van Scoyocs passion for the law was matched only by her love of family. Her professional acumen and excellence were only surpassed by her dedication to loved ones and friends and her kindness to all people. A devoted daughter, sister, sister-in-law and aunt, she lovingly cared for her parents and delighted in spending time with her extended family.
Blessed with a brilliant mind and beautiful spirit, Ms. Van Scoyoc touched, inspired, and enriched the lives of all who knew her. Her wisdom, integrity and perspective left an indelible mark on the governments and the people she served.

Christian is primarily a problem-solver, with an unyielding dedication to creatively and cost-effectively furthering his clients long-term business interests by guiding them in a manner that avoids risk and exposure. Those clients range from Fortune 500 and 1000 companies to small businesses and individuals, who serve a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, distribution and supply, engineering, property and equipment leasing, insurance, construction, and pharmaceutical.
Christian counsels his clients on a broad spectrum of employer issues such as executive and equity compensation, employment agreements, partnership agreements, OSHA and Department of Labor issues, the enforceability of post-employment covenants, discrimination, harassment, salary disputes, and crisis management.
When necessary, Christian is an accomplished litigator and trial lawyer with more than 20 years of experience successfully representing his clients across the country. He has successfully tried numerous jury trials to verdict and in that context has earned a reputation for winning seemingly unwinnable cases. Christian concentrates his practice on a mix of business, employment and personal injury litigation, involving business tort, breach of contract and fraud allegations, coronavirus-related litigation (e.g., defending colleges, universities and other institutions against tuition, lodging and/or meal reimbursement claims, public nuisance claims, distance learning differential claims, etc.), construction litigation, professional malpractice, trade secret actions, wrongful death, high-exposure toxic tort litigation, products liability, construction and labor law litigation. These matters often involve bet-the-company stakes, death or catastrophic injuries.
Prior to joining Hodgson Russ, Christian was associated with OConnor Redd Orlando LLP where he tried multiple civil cases to verdict. Before that, he tried criminal cases as an Assistant District Attorney in Orange County.

The scope of the CDLHL expanded over the years to include lawyers, law students and judges who are struggling with mental health issues both large and small such as anxiety, grief, gambling disorder, depression, and anger management. The CDLHL welcomes anyone in the profession who is having difficulties in their personal or professional lives to join us for connection and support.
The CDLHL is a peer led support group that is supported by the New York State Bar Associations Lawyer Assistance Program (NYSBA LAP). Although not an official standing committee of NYSBA, the CDLHL is recognized as a NYSBA affiliated group and receives staff support, has an online community, and has access to NYSBAs Bar Center and resources for its meetings and events. There are no dues associated with involvement with the CDLHL, and NYSBA membership, while encouraged, is not required.
The mission of the Capital District Lawyers Helping Lawyers Committee is to give confidential assistance to lawyers, judges, law students, and other members of the legal profession struggling with alcoholism, substance abuse and dependence, other addictions, depression, and mental health problems that threaten or impair professional and personal life. Within the statewide Lawyer Assistance Program of the New York State Bar Association, the Committee has two goals: To give the bench and bar a better understanding of these conditions through appropriate education and dialogue, and to give colleagues in recovery hope and confidence through our example. The services we offer to members of the legal profession and their families include outreach, education, prevention, consultation, intervention, referral, peer support, and mentoring.
The CDLHL/HVLHL holds hybrid meetings on the first Wednesday of the month at 12:30 pm. These meetings are held at the Bar Center and over Zoom. The group also holds a virtual-only meeting on the third Friday of the month at 4:00 pm. Each meeting is structured a bit differently, but in general the meetings start with introductions, then a topical reading and open discussion.
The CD and HV LHLs work include outreach to local bar associations, providing public service announcements for CLE programming, developing educational programming, planning the annual dinner, and volunteering with the LAP as peer support, monitors, and program speakers.
Membership in NYSBA is not required and there is no cost to participate. All communications are confidential.
Each May, the CDLHL hosts a celebratory birthday lunch during its regular meeting sponsored by the LAP. Members, current and past, attend this annual event. This event has been put on hold for 2020 and 2021 due to COVID restrictions.
Each November, the CDLHL hosts a volunteer dinner and awards the Ray of Hope award to an outstanding volunteer. The dinner is always well attended and a wonderful celebration to thank all those who have volunteered and participated in the CDLHL. This event was not held in 2020 due to restrictions, but November 2021 is looking good for its return!
The CDLHL, as a recognized group under the LAP and its associated Lawyer Assistance Committee, is protected under Judiciary Law Section 499 which states:
This allows for an open dialogue between members of the CDLHL and with LAP staff and with any other individuals who are acting as an authorized agent of the LAC without concern of disclosure.
Volunteers are an integral component of the statewide Lawyer Assistance efforts. Peer support has proven time and time again to be a vital component to the improvement in the condition of an attorney that is struggling. Having that connection to another attorney is a secure point for many who feel alone and have no other supports in place. Volunteers share their experiences and time, providing the struggling attorney with friendship, advice, and support. Volunteers connect with attorneys in person and over the phone, through text and email. Whatever method works best for the volunteer and the attorney is the best method for the connection. It cannot be stressed enough how important volunteers are to the program, they are the lifeblood of the LAP. The volunteer training manual is below, please read through it and contact the LAP for more information.
In addition to providing peer assistance and support to their colleagues, volunteers can serve as speakers who help educate the legal profession about stress, depression, addiction and other mental healthissues.
For additional information on how to become a LAP volunteer, call Stacey Whiteley, 518.487.5688 or email [emailprotected].
Alcohol use disorder is the most common substance use disorder in the United States, affecting nearly three million people annually. Up to 40% of all hospital beds in the US are being used to treat health conditions related to alcohol. There are an average of six deaths every day due to alcohol overdoses. These statistics are shocking, but for those in the legal field, the statistics around alcohol use disorder are even more concerning. In a recent study, one in five practicing lawyers reported problematic drinking patterns, which is significantly higher than studies which show 6.4% of Americans exhibited signs of alcohol use disorder.* There are many suggested reasons for the high rate of alcohol issues with those in the law, but the fact remains, alcohol use disorder is a big problem for the profession. There is help. The LAP can help you or your colleague come to terms with the problem and seek the professional help needed. If youre concerned about your own drinking and want to take proactive steps before the disorder grows-because alcohol use disorder is a progressive disease, there are many in-person and online resources and supports available. These are listed below.
If youre not sure if your alcohol use is really a problem in your life, there are several online tests available to help you figure that out. There is a link to one listed below. Alcohol is an addictive substance, no matter how little or how much you drink, its impact on your body is designed to increase your desire to consume more.
Substance use disorders, encompassing drugs such as opioids, benzodiazepines (benzos), stimulants, and even marijuana (THC) are not as highly reported in the legal field as alcohol use disorder, but they are still prevalent and can destroy a lawyers career, personal relationships, health and can take their life. Substance use disorders are treatable and help is available. LAP support and assistance is available call Director, Stacey Whiteley at 518.487.5688. Additional information can be found below.

Sexual Harassment and Retaliation in the Legal Profession: How To Stop It - New York State Bar Association
Hi. Im working as a temp while paying my way through law school. If I were to be sexually harassed there, I would report it and quit. But once I start work at a law firm, well . . . thats my career. If I experience harassment there, what should I do?
I have heard this question many times, in one form or another, after presenting workplace anti-harassment trainings. You would hope the question wouldnt need to be asked about the legal workplace. After all, any lawyer should know that sexual harassment is illegal under federal, state, and local law, violates the rules of professional conduct, and may violate criminal law.[1]
And yet, the question needs to be asked because sexual harassment is pervasive in the legal world. A national survey in 2019 found that [a] broad spectrum of sexual misconduct and harassing behaviors  from criminal or civilly actionable to simply unconscionable  continues to plague all walks of the legal profession.[2] The American Bar Association reported in 2019 that sexual harassment is widespread throughout the profession.[3] A global survey conducted in 2018 found that bullying and sexual harassment are rife in the legal profession.[4] Sexual harassment is one reason attorneys suffer from anxiety, depression, trauma, and reduced productivity and focus at work.[5] Sexual harassment, whether by a partner, judge, colleague, or client, is a core reason women leave their law firms and even the practice of law.[6]
The question needs to be asked because our current attempts to address sexual harassment in the legal profession, including reports, surveys, policies, and training, are not enough. Note that the law student and her peers are not asking how to respond to sexual harassment in the workplace. They know their rights. They know they have the right to tell the harasser to stop, the right to intervene or disrupt the harassment of others, the right to report the harassment to their employer, and the right to file a charge or complaint with federal, state or local agencies, the courts, or the police.
The question really being asked above is whether one should respond to sexual harassment in the legal workplace. The law students question stems from their fear that, despite years of studying and hard work, reporting sexual harassment could mean risking their careers.
They are not alone in their concern. Surveys on sexual harassment in the legal profession consistently find that most attorneys who experience harassment do not report it, and an oft-cited reason is the fear of retaliation.[7] Attorneys fear that if they report sexual harassment, or support a colleague reporting harassment, their employers will take adverse action against them  such as terminating their employment, taking them off the partnership track, transferring them to a less prestigious team, banning them from high-profile cases, reducing their salary or bonus, or damaging their personal or professional reputation.
Yes, retaliation is illegal.[8] It is unlawful to retaliate against applicants or employees for engaging in protected activity such as resisting or objecting to harassing conduct, reporting workplace harassment, participating in an employers investigation of alleged harassment, and filing a charge or lawsuit alleging harassment.
But retaliation happens. Of the charges filed with the EEOC in 2020, 55.8% alleged retaliation and 41.5% alleged retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.[9] Within the legal profession, when attorneys do report sexual harassment, the actual consequences of reporting the harassment proved these fears [of retaliation] to be warranted.[10]
Attorneys fear, with data to support that fear, that employers will use their own financial interests to justify retaliation. One law firm may seek to maintain a lucrative relationship by acceding to a clients demands to remove certain attorneys from their team. Another firm may seek to retain a rainmaking partner by agreeing not to promote certain associates. Partners may use the supposed best interests of their clients as a pretext to avoid working with attorneys who asserted harassment. Managers may cite economic considerations as an excuse to derail the career of associates who alleged harassment and advance the careers of their peers.
Employers may also seek to cover up their retaliatory actions by disparaging their employees job performance, knowing they have a valid defense if they can establish legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for their adverse action.[11] Employers may claim that employees were passed over for promotion, or given a smaller than expected bonus, or terminated only because they arent meeting workplace demands, arent measuring up to peers, or violated company policies, not because they complained of harassment.
Given these facts, advising someone on what they should do when facing sexual harassment is complicated. We know what the law says, but we also know there is risk. We can only make recommendations:
Document any actual or suspected incidents of harassment and retaliation. Keep contemporaneous records with details of who said or did what, and when.
Continue to fulfill the responsibilities of your position or seek job-protected leave. Do not give an employer justification for an adverse employment action.
Report even suspected incidents of harassment and retaliation. The law protects employees who have a reasonable, good-faith belief that the activity they are reporting violates the law.
File an external charge or complaint, if necessary. If the employer fails to respond to an internal complaint, file a complaint with the EEOC, state or local agencies, courts, or the police.
Seek advice from mentors, advisors, trusted friends, or legal counsel. Seek help from the people who can provide advice on employee rights, who can provide guidance on how to handle difficult situations at work, and who can provide emotional support during a stressful period.
Even following all these recommendations, however, harassed employees cannot prevent retaliation and we cannot expect them to do so.
Rather, as members of the legal profession, it is our legal, moral and ethical responsibility to end sexual harassment and retaliation in our workplaces. We must not engage in such behavior, and we should do what we can to stop others from engaging in such behavior. If we are bystanders or witnesses to sexual harassment, we can document and report what we witness, and participate in any investigation. If we can act without risking our personal safety, we can interrupt harassment or divert the harasser. And we can support the mental health and well-being of employees who are harassed.
We can also help change the culture of our workplaces by insisting on true leadership and accountability. Laws and policies are not enough. The leaders of our firms and organizations  that is, the partners, counsel, officers, directors, and managers  must be role models for proper behavior. They must make it clear throughout their organizations and by their own actions that harassment and retaliation are not acceptable, and that complaints will be taken seriously. They must establish multiple avenues for employees to report harassment and retaliation. They must ensure that the firm or organization will act in response to any such reports, regardless of whether the accused is a rainmaker or important client. They must enforce discipline against anyone who engages in harassment or retaliation and against any supervisor who becomes aware of such behavior and allows it to continue.
We, and the leaders of our firms and legal workplaces, must make our workplaces safe for everyone, so that no one will have reason to fear sexual harassment or retaliation in the legal profession.

New York State Bar Association Presents Webinar About Harassment and Hostile Work Environment Law - New York State Bar Association
News CenterNew York State Bar Association Presents Webinar About Harassment and Hostile Work Environment Law
In the wake of the New York State Attorney Generals investigative findings that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and created a toxic workplace with retaliatory behavior, the New York State Bar Association will present a timely webinar about harassment and hostile work environment law.
The live webinar Harassment and Hostile Work Environment Law will take place on Friday, Aug. 13 from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.
Specifically, the webinar will explore the recently updated New York State Human Rights Law and its impact on hostile work environment claims. The changes eliminated the restriction that harassment be severe or pervasive to be legally actionable, mandated that all non-disclosure agreements allow employees to file a complaint of harassment or discrimination and extended the statute of limitations for employment sexual harassment claims from one year to three years.
Nina R. Frank, of Outten & Golden, will be the events featured speaker. Frank represents individual employees in litigation and negotiation in all areas of employment law and is a member of the firms Sex Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Practice Group.
The New York State Bar Association is the largest voluntary state bar association in the nation.

T. Andrew Brown, president of the New York State Bar Association, issued the following statement today about the Attorney Generals findings in the investigation of Gov. Andrew Cuomo:
For too long, women have labored in toxic work environments that tolerated sexual harassment and bullying. When this shameful behavior occurs in the public sector, it is even more reprehensible. The New York State Bar Association believes in true gender equity and has worked tirelessly to elevate the position of women in the legal profession and to eliminate gender discrimination in all walks of life. The Attorney Generals report reminds us once again of how pervasive sexual harassment is in our society, and we vow to redouble our efforts to ensure that all women in the public and private sectors are protected from this scourge.

U.S. DOE issues final Title IX regulations - New York State School Boards Association
The U.S. Department of Education recently issued final Title IX regulations that for the first time codify rules specifically pertaining to sexual harassment. The regulations serve to implement Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments - a federal civil rights statute which prohibits school districts, as recipients of federal funding, from engaging in practices or activities that discriminate on the basis of sex, including sexual harassment. Until now, the rules used to determine whether sexual harassment in violation of Title IX has occurred have been mainly established by case law and federal agency guidance and interpretations.
The new federal regulations have an effective date of Aug. 14, 2020. They will impact how districts in New York respond to allegations of sexual harassment involving both students and staff. In taking steps toward compliance, districts will also need to consider potential overlaps between the regulations and existing state laws that also prohibit sexual harassment. Therefore, districts should consult with their school attorneys to ensure that their policies and practices comply with both the final Title IX regulations and existing state law.
The regulations and their practical implications will be discussed in greater detail during NYSSBA's 2020 Summer Law Conference. In addition, NYSSBA's Policy Services will be developing suggested updates to current school district policies.
Following is a summary of some of the more general provisions included in the final regulations. Pertaining to a new definition of sexual harassment, the designation of Title IX Coordinators, policy requirements, training, and record retention. Accompanying this summary is a Q&A on procedural requirements for addressing alleged sexual harassment misconduct, including procedures for reporting, investigating and making determinations regarding any such allegation.
Definition of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment in a school setting occurs when (1) a district employee conditions the provision of an aid, benefit, or service on an individual's participation in unwanted sexual conduct; and/or (2) there is unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to a district's education program or activity; and/or (3) there has been an incident of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence or stalking as defined under federal law.
In this context, an education program or activity includes locations, events or circumstances, over which a district exercises substantial control over both the individual reported to have committed conduct that could constitute sexual harassment and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs.
Importantly, the regulations provide that the conduct alleged to constitute sexual harassment must have occurred within the United States, which raises questions as to what happens when the misconduct occurs, for example, during student trips abroad.
Designation of a Title IX Coordinator. Districts must designate at least one employee to be their Title IX Coordinator and authorize such individual(s) to coordinate the district's efforts to comply with its responsibilities under the regulations.
In addition, districts must notify students, parents or legal guardians, employees and unions of the name and specified contact information for the designated Title IX Coordinator(s). That notification must also state that inquiries about the application of Title IX and its regulations may be directed to the district's Title IX Coordinator or the Assistant Secretary of Education, or both.
Policy requirement. School districts must have a policy that states they do not discriminate on the basis of sex in the education programs or activities they operate, including admission and employment, and that they are required by Title IX and its corresponding regulations not to discriminate in such a manner.
Publication requirement. Districts must prominently display their Title IX anti-discrimination policy and the Title IX Coordinator(s) contact information on their website, if any, and in each handbook or catalog it makes available to students, parents or legal guardians, employees and unions.
Training requirements. The new regulations require that Title IX Coordinator(s), investigators, decision-makers, and those facilitating an informal resolution process, if applicable, receive training in a number of areas specified in the regulations.
Retention of records. Districts must maintain for a minimum of seven years certain specified records relating to sexual harassment including, for example, investigation records, determinations, remedies provided, disciplinary sanctions imposed and appeal records. Records of mandated training materials also must be maintained.
