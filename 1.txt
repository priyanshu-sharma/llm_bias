Title IX and Sex Discrimination
U.S.  Department of Education
Office for Civil Rights
400 Maryland Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20202-1328
Revised August 2021
Title IX
The U.S. Department of  Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces, among other statutes,  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX protects people from  discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive  federal financial assistance. Title IX states:
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education  program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
Scope of Title IX
Title IX applies to  schools, local and state educational agencies, and other institutions that  receive federal financial assistance from the Department. These recipients include  approximately 17,600 local school districts, over 5,000 postsecondary  institutions, and charter schools, for-profit schools, libraries, and museums.  Also included are vocational rehabilitation agencies and education agencies of  50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories of the United States.
A recipient institution that receives Department funds must operate its education program or activity in a nondiscriminatory manner free of discrimination based on sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Some key issue areas in which recipients have Title IX obligations are: recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; treatment of LGBTQI+ students; discipline; single-sex education; and employment. Also, no recipient or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or its implementing regulations, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in a proceeding under Title IX. For a recipient to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. The Department’s Title IX regulations (Volume 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 106) provide additional information about the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.
OCR’s Enforcement of  Title IX
OCR vigorously  enforces Title IX to ensure that institutions that receive federal financial  assistance from the Department comply with the law. OCR evaluates,  investigates, and resolves complaints alleging sex discrimination. OCR also  conducts proactive investigations, through directed investigations or compliance  reviews, to examine potential systemic violations based on sources of  information other than complaints.
In addition to its  enforcement activities, OCR provides information and guidance to schools, universities and other educational  institutions and agencies to assist them in voluntarily complying with the law.
To learn more about  filing a complaint with OCR, please visit https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html.  For assistance related to Title IX or other civil rights laws, please contact  OCR at OCR@ed.gov or 800-421-3481, TDD 800-877-8339.

Overview
Legislation, regulations, guidance, and other policy documents can be found here for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and other topics.
Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.  So, if you have a question about a policy or issue, you may want to check with the relevant organization in your state or school district.

About OCR
Overview of the Agency
The mission of the Office for Civil Rights is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation through vigorous enforcement of civil rights.
We serve student populations facing discrimination and the advocates and institutions promoting systemic solutions to civil rights problems.  An important responsibility is resolving complaints of discrimination. Agency-initiated cases, typically called compliance reviews, permit OCR to target resources on compliance problems that appear particularly acute. OCR also provides technical assistance to help institutions achieve voluntary compliance with the civil rights laws that OCR enforces.  An important part of OCR's technical assistance are partnerships designed to develop creative approaches to preventing and addressing discrimination.
The Office for Civil Rights enforces several Federal civil rights laws that
prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal financial
assistance from the Department of Education. Discrimination on the basis of
race, color, and national origin is prohibited by Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; sex discrimination is prohibited by
Title IX of the Education Amendments
of 1972; discrimination on the basis of disability is prohibited by Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and age discrimination is prohibited
by the Age Discrimination
Act of 1975. These civil rights laws enforced by OCR extend to all state
education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities,
vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies,
libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. Areas
covered may include, but are not limited to: admissions, recruitment, financial
aid, academic programs, student treatment and services, counseling and guidance,
discipline, classroom assignment, grading, vocational education, recreation,
physical education, athletics, housing, and employment. OCR also has responsibilities
under Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by
public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). To view OCR’s guidance please visit the Policy Guidance Portal.
In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy
Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001).
Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary school
or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more
outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities
before or after school hours shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to
meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy
Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United
States Code as a patriotic society.
A complaint of discrimination can be filed by anyone who believes that an education institution that receives Federal financial assistance has discriminated against someone on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. The person or organization filing the complaint need not be a victim of the alleged discrimination, but may complain on behalf of another person or group.
The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a mandatory biennial collection of district-and school-level data. The CRDC is administered by OCR, which uses the data to enforce civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national, origin, sex, and disability. The data are collected from public-school districts and public schools in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The CRDC collects data on civil rights indicators at the early childhood through grade 12 levels. It measures factors that impact education equity and opportunity for students, including student access to courses, programs, resources, instructional and other staff – and school climate factors, such as student discipline and harassment. The CRDC data can be accessed at https://ocrdata.ed.gov. To submit a CRDC data quality concern with OCR, please contact us by emailing ocrdata@ed.gov. Please include “CRDC Data Quality Concern” in the subject heading.
Most of OCR's activities are conducted by its 12 enforcement offices throughout the country. These enforcement offices are organized into 4 divisions carrying out OCR's core work -- preventing, identifying, ending, and remedying discrimination against America's students. Three Enforcement Directors in the office of the Assistant Secretary oversee the work of, respectively, the Eastern and Southern and the Midwestern and Western divisions. OCR administrative offices in Washington, D.C., provide additional administrative support, coordination, policy development and overall leadership.

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)
Background Information
Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The collection was formerly administered as the Elementary and Secondary School Survey.
The CRDC gathers a variety of information including student enrollment and student’s access to educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learner, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights laws for which it is responsible. Information collected by the CRDC is also used by other ED offices as well as policymakers and researchers outside of ED.
For further general information about the CRDC, visit the CRDC FAQ page.
2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs NEW!
On April 18, 2023, OCR received approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to require all local educational agencies (LEA) in the country that receive federal financial assistance from ED, including every public school district, charter schools, juvenile justice facilities, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with disabilities, to respond to the CRDC for the 2021-22 and 2023-24 school years. OCR made changes to the CRDC, including, but not limited to the restoration of long-standing and useful data elements that have been collected in previous CRDCs as well as some new data elements. For more details about changes in the  2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs, please see 2021-22 Questions and Answers  PDF (183K) and 2023-24 Questions and Answers  PDF (181K). OCR will notify LEAs of the dates when they must submit data for the 2021-22 CRDC.

These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance).

Title IX and Sex Discrimination
U.S.  Department of Education
Office for Civil Rights
400 Maryland Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20202-1328
Revised August 2021
Title IX
The U.S. Department of  Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces, among other statutes,  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX protects people from  discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive  federal financial assistance. Title IX states:
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education  program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
Scope of Title IX
Title IX applies to  schools, local and state educational agencies, and other institutions that  receive federal financial assistance from the Department. These recipients include  approximately 17,600 local school districts, over 5,000 postsecondary  institutions, and charter schools, for-profit schools, libraries, and museums.  Also included are vocational rehabilitation agencies and education agencies of  50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories of the United States.
A recipient institution that receives Department funds must operate its education program or activity in a nondiscriminatory manner free of discrimination based on sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Some key issue areas in which recipients have Title IX obligations are: recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; treatment of LGBTQI+ students; discipline; single-sex education; and employment. Also, no recipient or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or its implementing regulations, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in a proceeding under Title IX. For a recipient to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. The Department’s Title IX regulations (Volume 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 106) provide additional information about the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.
OCR’s Enforcement of  Title IX
OCR vigorously  enforces Title IX to ensure that institutions that receive federal financial  assistance from the Department comply with the law. OCR evaluates,  investigates, and resolves complaints alleging sex discrimination. OCR also  conducts proactive investigations, through directed investigations or compliance  reviews, to examine potential systemic violations based on sources of  information other than complaints.
In addition to its  enforcement activities, OCR provides information and guidance to schools, universities and other educational  institutions and agencies to assist them in voluntarily complying with the law.
To learn more about  filing a complaint with OCR, please visit https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html.  For assistance related to Title IX or other civil rights laws, please contact  OCR at OCR@ed.gov or 800-421-3481, TDD 800-877-8339.
On request, this  publication is available in alternate formats, such as Braille or large print.  For more information, please contact the Department’s Alternate Format Center  at 202-260-0818 or via e-mail at alternateformatcenter@ed.gov.  If you have difficulty understanding English,  you may request language assistance services for Department information that is  available to the public.

About OCR
Overview of the Agency
The mission of the Office for Civil Rights is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation through vigorous enforcement of civil rights.
We serve student populations facing discrimination and the advocates and institutions promoting systemic solutions to civil rights problems.  An important responsibility is resolving complaints of discrimination. Agency-initiated cases, typically called compliance reviews, permit OCR to target resources on compliance problems that appear particularly acute. OCR also provides technical assistance to help institutions achieve voluntary compliance with the civil rights laws that OCR enforces.  An important part of OCR's technical assistance are partnerships designed to develop creative approaches to preventing and addressing discrimination.
The Office for Civil Rights enforces several Federal civil rights laws that
prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal financial
assistance from the Department of Education. Discrimination on the basis of
race, color, and national origin is prohibited by Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; sex discrimination is prohibited by
Title IX of the Education Amendments
of 1972; discrimination on the basis of disability is prohibited by Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and age discrimination is prohibited
by the Age Discrimination
Act of 1975. These civil rights laws enforced by OCR extend to all state
education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities,
vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies,
libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. Areas
covered may include, but are not limited to: admissions, recruitment, financial
aid, academic programs, student treatment and services, counseling and guidance,
discipline, classroom assignment, grading, vocational education, recreation,
physical education, athletics, housing, and employment. OCR also has responsibilities
under Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by
public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). To view OCR’s guidance please visit the Policy Guidance Portal.
In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy
Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001).
Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary school
or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more
outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities
before or after school hours shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to
meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy
Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United
States Code as a patriotic society.
A complaint of discrimination can be filed by anyone who believes that an education institution that receives Federal financial assistance has discriminated against someone on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. The person or organization filing the complaint need not be a victim of the alleged discrimination, but may complain on behalf of another person or group.
The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a mandatory biennial collection of district-and school-level data. The CRDC is administered by OCR, which uses the data to enforce civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national, origin, sex, and disability. The data are collected from public-school districts and public schools in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The CRDC collects data on civil rights indicators at the early childhood through grade 12 levels. It measures factors that impact education equity and opportunity for students, including student access to courses, programs, resources, instructional and other staff – and school climate factors, such as student discipline and harassment. The CRDC data can be accessed at https://ocrdata.ed.gov. To submit a CRDC data quality concern with OCR, please contact us by emailing ocrdata@ed.gov. Please include “CRDC Data Quality Concern” in the subject heading.
Most of OCR's activities are conducted by its 12 enforcement offices throughout the country. These enforcement offices are organized into 4 divisions carrying out OCR's core work -- preventing, identifying, ending, and remedying discrimination against America's students. Three Enforcement Directors in the office of the Assistant Secretary oversee the work of, respectively, the Eastern and Southern and the Midwestern and Western divisions. OCR administrative offices in Washington, D.C., provide additional administrative support, coordination, policy development and overall leadership.

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)
Background Information
Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The collection was formerly administered as the Elementary and Secondary School Survey.
The CRDC gathers a variety of information including student enrollment and student’s access to educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learner, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights laws for which it is responsible. Information collected by the CRDC is also used by other ED offices as well as policymakers and researchers outside of ED.
For further general information about the CRDC, visit the CRDC FAQ page.
2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs NEW!
On April 18, 2023, OCR received approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to require all local educational agencies (LEA) in the country that receive federal financial assistance from ED, including every public school district, charter schools, juvenile justice facilities, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with disabilities, to respond to the CRDC for the 2021-22 and 2023-24 school years. OCR made changes to the CRDC, including, but not limited to the restoration of long-standing and useful data elements that have been collected in previous CRDCs as well as some new data elements. For more details about changes in the  2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs, please see 2021-22 Questions and Answers  PDF (183K) and 2023-24 Questions and Answers  PDF (181K).

Disability Discrimination
Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act
OCR enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive Federal funds from the Department of Education. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.

U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sex-Based Harassment Investigation of Taft College in California
U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sex-Based Harassment Investigation of Taft College in California
October 19, 2023
Contact:   Press Office, (202) 401-1576, press@ed.gov
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil  Rights (OCR) today announced that Taft College in California has entered into a  resolution agreement to ensure the college’s compliance with Title IX of the  Education Amendments of 1972 when responding to allegations of harassment based  on sex, including sex stereotyping.
OCR found that the college failed to respond as required  by Title IX to repeated allegations from one of its students, who is  transgender, that college employees harassed the student based on sex for more  than a year.
The investigation included allegations that a professor  told the student, in front of her whole class, that based on her “physical  appearance” the professor did not consider the student “feminine enough” and  that on another occasion an administrator of the student’s college program  knowingly excluded the student when addressing other female students as  “ladies” in class.
OCR’s investigation also reflected that the college  received repeated notice that the student alleged experiencing almost daily  harassment including through faculty misgendering the student, but the college  did not respond to these allegations to confirm their occurrence or redress the  harm the student reported experiencing.
As a result, OCR determined that the college subjected  the student to a hostile environment based on sex that negatively impacted the  student’s education.
OCR also identified a compliance concern that the college  may not have provided adequate notice to students, staff, and faculty about how  to make a complaint of sex-based harassment under Title IX and may have failed  to adequately notify the college community of its Title IX coordinator and how  to contact this person.
The resolution agreement reached today commits the  college to take the steps needed to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of  sex in all of its education programs and activities.
“Today’s resolution with Taft College addresses harassment experienced by a transgender student based on unlawful sex  stereotyping,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon.  “Taft College has committed to comply with Title IX to protect all its students  in the future."
The college’s commitments in the resolution agreement include:
Offering to reimburse the student for counseling to address the effects of the sex-based harassment during the student’s enrollment.
Reviewing and revising, as necessary, its policies and procedures to clarify that harassment based on sex includes harassment based on sex stereotyping.
Training its employees who respond to sex-based harassment about the college’s obligations under Title IX. And,
Providing documentation to OCR demonstrating that the college’s responses to complaints of sex-based harassment during the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years complied with Title IX.
The letter to Taft College and the resolution agreement are available on the Office for Civil Rights website.

Sex Discrimination
Race and National Origin Discrimination
Age Discrimination
Disability Discrimination
Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act
OCR enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive Federal funds from the Department of Education. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.

Disability Discrimination
The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (Amendments Act), effective January 1, 2009, amends the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and includes a conforming amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act) that affects the meaning of the term disability in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). The Amendments Act retains the definition of disability under Section 504 and the ADA but emphasizes that the definition should be interpreted broadly.  Among other things, the Amendments Act directs that the ameliorating effects of mitigating measures (other than ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses) not be considered in determining whether an individual has a disability; expands the scope of "major life activities" by providing a non-exhaustive list of general activities and a non-exhaustive list of major bodily functions; clarifies that an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active; and clarifies the meaning of "regarded as" having a disability, including that individuals "regarded as" having a disability are not entitled to reasonable accommodations or reasonable modifications.
OCR is evaluating the impact of the Amendments Act on OCR's enforcement responsibilities under Section 504 and under Title II of the ADA, including whether any changes in regulations, guidance, or other publications are appropriate.

Disability Discrimination
Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act
OCR enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive Federal funds from the Department of Education. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.

About OCR
Overview of the Agency
The mission of the Office for Civil Rights is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation through vigorous enforcement of civil rights.
We serve student populations facing discrimination and the advocates and institutions promoting systemic solutions to civil rights problems.  An important responsibility is resolving complaints of discrimination. Agency-initiated cases, typically called compliance reviews, permit OCR to target resources on compliance problems that appear particularly acute. OCR also provides technical assistance to help institutions achieve voluntary compliance with the civil rights laws that OCR enforces.  An important part of OCR's technical assistance are partnerships designed to develop creative approaches to preventing and addressing discrimination.
The Office for Civil Rights enforces several Federal civil rights laws that
prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal financial
assistance from the Department of Education. Discrimination on the basis of
race, color, and national origin is prohibited by Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; sex discrimination is prohibited by
Title IX of the Education Amendments
of 1972; discrimination on the basis of disability is prohibited by Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and age discrimination is prohibited
by the Age Discrimination
Act of 1975. These civil rights laws enforced by OCR extend to all state
education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities,
vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies,
libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. Areas
covered may include, but are not limited to: admissions, recruitment, financial
aid, academic programs, student treatment and services, counseling and guidance,
discipline, classroom assignment, grading, vocational education, recreation,
physical education, athletics, housing, and employment. OCR also has responsibilities
under Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by
public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). To view OCR’s guidance please visit the Policy Guidance Portal.
In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy
Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001).
Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary school
or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more
outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities
before or after school hours shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to
meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy
Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United
States Code as a patriotic society.
A complaint of discrimination can be filed by anyone who believes that an education institution that receives Federal financial assistance has discriminated against someone on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. The person or organization filing the complaint need not be a victim of the alleged discrimination, but may complain on behalf of another person or group.
The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a mandatory biennial collection of district-and school-level data. The CRDC is administered by OCR, which uses the data to enforce civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national, origin, sex, and disability. The data are collected from public-school districts and public schools in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The CRDC collects data on civil rights indicators at the early childhood through grade 12 levels. It measures factors that impact education equity and opportunity for students, including student access to courses, programs, resources, instructional and other staff – and school climate factors, such as student discipline and harassment. The CRDC data can be accessed at https://ocrdata.ed.gov. To submit a CRDC data quality concern with OCR, please contact us by emailing ocrdata@ed.gov. Please include “CRDC Data Quality Concern” in the subject heading.
Most of OCR's activities are conducted by its 12 enforcement offices throughout the country. These enforcement offices are organized into 4 divisions carrying out OCR's core work -- preventing, identifying, ending, and remedying discrimination against America's students. Three Enforcement Directors in the office of the Assistant Secretary oversee the work of, respectively, the Eastern and Southern and the Midwestern and Western divisions. OCR administrative offices in Washington, D.C., provide additional administrative support, coordination, policy development and overall leadership.

Overview
Legislation, regulations, guidance, and other policy documents can be found here for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and other topics.
Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.  So, if you have a question about a policy or issue, you may want to check with the relevant organization in your state or school district.

Sex Discrimination: Overview of the Law
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX states: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]” All federal agencies that provide grants of financial assistance are required to enforce Title IX’s nondiscrimination mandate. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) gives grants of financial assistance to schools and colleges and to certain other entities, including vocational rehabilitation programs and libraries.
In 1975, the Department’s predecessor, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, issued final regulations implementing Title IX. In 2020, the Department amended the Title IX regulations after public notice and comment. The Title IX regulations, which are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at 34 CFR Part 106, are enforced by the Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR).
Examples of the types of discrimination that are covered under Title IX include sexual harassment; the failure to provide equal athletic opportunity; sex-based discrimination in a school’s science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses and programs; and discrimination based on pregnancy. A fuller list of Title IX issues OCR addresses appears here.
Title IX also prohibits retaliation for filing an OCR complaint or for advocating for a right protected by Title IX and discrimination in employment which is based on sex. However, employment discrimination complaints filed with OCR are generally referred to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Links to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulation:
20 USC 1681: Sex (USCode.house.gov)
34 CFR Part 106 (current regulations)
34 CFR Part 106 (regulations in effect prior to August 14, 2020)
For additional information about the Department’s current Title IX regulations, please see OCR’s Questions and Answers resource and related appendix on the Title IX Regulations on Sexual Harassment. The Q&A clarifies how OCR interprets schools’ existing obligations under the current regulations, including the areas in which schools have discretion in their procedures for responding to reports of sexual harassment. The appendix provides examples of Title IX procedures that schools may find helpful in implementing the current regulations and can adapt to their own circumstances. Please also note that OCR issued a Letter to Students, Educators, and other Stakeholders re Victim Rights Law Center et al. v. Cardona (Aug. 24, 2021) addressing one provision of the current regulations.
In 2022 and 2023, the Department published two notices of proposed rulemaking to amend its Title IX regulations. On July 12, 2022, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend its Title IX regulations with a 60-day comment period, which closed on September 12, 2022 (July 2022 NPRM). You can access the July 2022 NPRM and view submitted comments here, and you can find a fact sheet about the July 2022 NPRM here.
On April 13, 2023, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking to address sex-related eligibility criteria for male and female athletic teams under the Department’s Title IX regulations with a 30-day comment period, which closed on May 15, 2023 (Athletics NPRM). You can access the Athletics NPRM and view submitted comments here, and you can find a fact sheet about the Athletics NPRM here.
Following the Department’s review and consideration of the comments received on the proposed regulations, the resulting final regulations and their effective date will be published in the Federal Register. In addition, the preamble to the final regulations will include a summary of the comments received, the Department’s response to the comments, and an explanation of any changes made to the regulations that differ from the proposed regulations.
If you have questions or require technical assistance, please contact ocr@ed.gov.

Age Discrimination: Overview of the Laws
The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination based on age in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. The U.S. Department of Education gives financial assistance to schools and colleges. The Age Discrimination regulation describes conduct that violates the Act. The Age Discrimination regulation is enforced by the Office for Civil Rights and is in the Code of Federal Regulations at 34 CFR Part 110.
The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 does not cover employment discrimination. Complaints of employment discrimination based on age may be filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
The regulations under the Age Discrimination Act, however, allow you to file a claim in Federal court under that law only after (1) 180 days have passed since you file your complaint with OCR and OCR has made no finding, or (2) OCR issues a finding in favor of the recipient. In the latter case, OCR will promptly notify you and remind you of your right to file in court.
The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits retaliation for filing a complaint with OCR or for advocating for a right protected by the Act.

Filing a Complaint >>
Overview
This page provides specific and detailed information that will assist you  in filing a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department  of Education. Please read all of the information below before continuing on to  the complaint form. Additional information is available at How OCR Handles  Complaints and Questions and  Answers on OCR's Complaint Process.
OCR has the  authority to investigate complaints claiming a covered entity discriminated  based on:
race, color, national origin, ethnicity, or ancestry, including  a person’s
limited English proficiency or English learner status; and
actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic  characteristics, including membership in a religion that may be perceived to  exhibit such characteristics (such as Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh individuals)
sex or gender, including
pregnancy or parental status;
sex stereotypes (such as treating persons differently because  they do not conform to sex-role expectations or because they are attracted to  or are in relationships with persons of the same sex); and
gender identity or transgender status;
disability, including those currently without an impairment  that substantially limits a major life activity, but who have a record of or  are regarded as having a disability; and
age.
OCR also  has the authority to investigate complaints claiming a covered entity:
retaliated for the purpose of interfering with any right or  privilege protected by the laws enforced by OCR;
retaliated because someone made a complaint, testified, assisted,  or participated in any manner in an OCR matter; and
discriminated against any youth group officially affiliated  with a group or organization listed  in title 36 of the United States Code (as a patriotic society) that is  intended to serve young people under the age of 21 that requests to conduct a meeting  at a public school.
Covered  entities include all public and private  programs that receive Federal funds from the U.S. Department of Education.  These include all public schools and most public and private colleges, as well  as some other entities, such as vocational rehabilitation agencies and  libraries.  For claims of disability  discrimination (including disability-related retaliation), covered entities  also include all state and local government entities, even if they do not  receive Federal funds.
If you believe you have been discriminated or retaliated  against on any of these bases by a covered entity, you may file a complaint  using either the electronic complaint form or the fillable PDF complaint form  linked at the bottom of this page.
If you choose to file a complaint using either method, you will  be asked to provide your name, address, and email address; the name and address  of the person discriminated against; and the name and address of the entity you  believe discriminated.
You also will be asked which of the kinds of discrimination  forms the basis for your complaint. You will need to provide a description of  the conduct that you believe is discriminatory.
By law, complaints of discrimination must ordinarily be filed  within 180 days of the last act of discrimination. If your complaint involves  matters that occurred longer ago than this and you are requesting a waiver, you  will be asked to show good cause why you did not file your complaint within the  180-day period.
You will be asked whether you have tried to resolve the matter  using a grievance procedure or by filing with another agency.
In addition to the complaint, a signed Consent Form may be required. When disclosure of the identity of  the complainant is necessary in order to resolve the complaint, OCR will  require written consent before proceeding. The complainant will be informed  that the complaint will be closed if written consent is necessary in order to  resolve the complaint and is not received within 20 calendar days of the date  of the acknowledgement letter or the date the Consent Form is requested from  the complainant. The signed Consent Form may be submitted to OCR by mail, fax, email  (with a scanned attachment), or in person.
When OCR has determined that consent is necessary in order to  resolve the complaint and OCR has not received a signed Consent Form by the  15th calendar day of the date of the acknowledgment letter or the date the  Consent Form is requested from the complainant, OCR will contact the  complainant (e.g., by phone) to inform the complainant that the complaint will  be closed if the signed Consent Form is not received within 5 calendar days. If  OCR does not receive signed written Consent Form, the complaint will be  dismissed, and the complainant informed in writing.
A complainant on behalf of or regarding to another person(s) is  responsible for securing any necessary written consent from that individual,  including when a parent files for a student over the age of 18. Where the  person is a minor (under the age of 18) or a legally incompetent adult, the  Consent Form must be signed by that person’s parent or legal guardian. Parental  or legal guardian consent may not be required for persons under the age of 18  if they are emancipated under state law and are therefore considered to have  obtained majority. Proof of emancipation or incompetence must be provided.
If you submit the completed electronic complaint form, it will  be routed to the OCR office with authority to handle complaints in the state  where the institution or entity you are complaining about is located.

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)
Background Information
Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The collection was formerly administered as the Elementary and Secondary School Survey.
The CRDC gathers a variety of information including student enrollment and student’s access to educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learner, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights laws for which it is responsible. Information collected by the CRDC is also used by other ED offices as well as policymakers and researchers outside of ED.
For further general information about the CRDC, visit the CRDC FAQ page.
2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs NEW!
On April 18, 2023, OCR received approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to require all local educational agencies (LEA) in the country that receive federal financial assistance from ED, including every public school district, charter schools, juvenile justice facilities, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with disabilities, to respond to the CRDC for the 2021-22 and 2023-24 school years. OCR made changes to the CRDC, including, but not limited to the restoration of long-standing and useful data elements that have been collected in previous CRDCs as well as some new data elements.

Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.  So, if you have a question about a policy or issue, you may want to check with the relevant organization in your state or school district.

Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act
OCR enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive Federal funds from the Department of Education. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.

Overview
Legislation, regulations, guidance, and other policy documents can be found here for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and other topics.
Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.  So, if you have a question about a policy or issue, you may want to check with the relevant organization in your state or school district.

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)
Background Information
Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The collection was formerly administered as the Elementary and Secondary School Survey.
The CRDC gathers a variety of information including student enrollment and student’s access to educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learner, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights laws for which it is responsible. Information collected by the CRDC is also used by other ED offices as well as policymakers and researchers outside of ED.
For further general information about the CRDC, visit the CRDC FAQ page.
2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs NEW!
On April 18, 2023, OCR received approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to require all local educational agencies (LEA) in the country that receive federal financial assistance from ED, including every public school district, charter schools, juvenile justice facilities, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with disabilities, to respond to the CRDC for the 2021-22 and 2023-24 school years. OCR made changes to the CRDC, including, but not limited to the restoration of long-standing and useful data elements that have been collected in previous CRDCs as well as some new data elements. For more details about changes in the  2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs, please see 2021-22 Questions and Answers  PDF (183K) and 2023-24 Questions and Answers  PDF (181K). OCR will notify LEAs of the dates when they must submit data for the 2021-22 CRDC.

Overview
Legislation, regulations, guidance, and other policy documents can be found here for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and other topics.
Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.  So, if you have a question about a policy or issue, you may want to check with the relevant organization in your state or school district.

OCR Complaint Process
Sex Discrimination
Race and National Origin Discrimination
Age Discrimination
Disability Discrimination
Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act
OCR enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive Federal funds from the Department of Education. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.

Our Mission
The Departmental Office of Civil Rights (DOCR) enforces civil rights laws and regulations, which prohibit workplace discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, age, genetic information, equal pay compensation, and reprisal in employment and the provision of government services.
Please read this important notice from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on reinforcing nondiscrimination on the basis of national origin and race during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Disability in the workplace
With respect to disability in the workplace, the DOCR office also has jurisdiction over some entities that do not receive Federal funds. In addition, DOCR is responsible for ensuring that DOT does not discriminate against its employees or applicants for employment, and that DOT conducts its programs and activities free of discrimination. Major statues which DOCR enforces include: Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; the Equal Pay Act of 1963; and, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.
DOCR Organization
DOT is composed of the Office of the Secretary (OST) and several transportation components referred to as "Operating Administrations" (OAs) (for example, the Federal Highway Administration). Generally, OST is responsible for policy and oversight of DOT transportation programs, and the OAs actually administer the programs for a particular mode of transportation, or transportation program area.
Within OST the Director of the Departmental Office of Civil Rights (DOCR) is the designated advisor to the Secretary on matters relating to civil rights in the Department of Transportation. The DOCR director provides leadership, policy, guidance, monitoring, and technical assistance to the OAs in implementing DOT's civil rights responsibilities.
Our Activities
Since nondiscrimination principles apply across the spectrum of civil rights, the Department has divided its activities along two broad categories:
Internal civil rights programs affecting DOT employees and applicants for employment.
External civil rights programs relating to the beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries of the various transportation programs receiving Federal financial assistance through DOT.
Each OA has an Office of Civil Rights, or individuals assigned these responsibilities, to ensure civil rights compliance for their respective organization and programs.

Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley: Let the World See
How do you change a nation? One ripple at a time. Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley: Let the World See, a traveling exhibit, shines the light on the hard truths that injustice, racism, and hate still exist—and points the way to how you can help transform your community by becoming a Ripple for Justice. Mamie Till-Mobley changed the world when she insisted it join her in bearing witness to the murder of her 14-year-old son, Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955. Her actions inspired positive change from the civil rights movement through today. The exhibit arrives to the National Civil Rights Museum October 7, 2023 and will share how a mother’s bravery and fight for justice more than six decades ago fueled the civil rights movement in America. Discover how a grieving mother helped fuel the Civil Rights Movement and how you can follow her example today in your own community. This historic exhibit is recommended for ages 10 years old and older.

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)
Background Information
Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The collection was formerly administered as the Elementary and Secondary School Survey.
The CRDC gathers a variety of information including student enrollment and student’s access to educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learner, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights laws for which it is responsible. Information collected by the CRDC is also used by other ED offices as well as policymakers and researchers outside of ED.

2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs NEW!
On April 18, 2023, OCR received approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to require all local educational agencies (LEA) in the country that receive federal financial assistance from ED, including every public school district, charter schools, juvenile justice facilities, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with disabilities, to respond to the CRDC for the 2021-22 and 2023-24 school years. OCR made changes to the CRDC, including, but not limited to the restoration of long-standing and useful data elements that have been collected in previous CRDCs as well as some new data elements.

Legislation, regulations, guidance, and other policy documents can be found here for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and other topics.
Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.  So, if you have a question about a policy or issue, you may want to check with the relevant organization in your state or school district.

Sex Discrimination

Age Discrimination
Disability Discrimination
Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act
OCR enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive Federal funds from the Department of Education. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.

Disability Discrimination
The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (Amendments Act), effective January 1, 2009, amends the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and includes a conforming amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act) that affects the meaning of the term disability in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). The Amendments Act retains the definition of disability under Section 504 and the ADA but emphasizes that the definition should be interpreted broadly.  Among other things, the Amendments Act directs that the ameliorating effects of mitigating measures (other than ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses) not be considered in determining whether an individual has a disability; expands the scope of "major life activities" by providing a non-exhaustive list of general activities and a non-exhaustive list of major bodily functions; clarifies that an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active; and clarifies the meaning of "regarded as" having a disability, including that individuals "regarded as" having a disability are not entitled to reasonable accommodations or reasonable modifications.
OCR is evaluating the impact of the Amendments Act on OCR's enforcement responsibilities under Section 504 and under Title II of the ADA, including whether any changes in regulations, guidance, or other publications are appropriate.

Overview
Legislation, regulations, guidance, and other policy documents can be found here for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and other topics.
Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.  So, if you have a question about a policy or issue, you may want to check with the relevant organization in your state or school district.

Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act
OCR enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive Federal funds from the Department of Education. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.

Disability Discrimination
The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (Amendments Act), effective January 1, 2009, amends the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and includes a conforming amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act) that affects the meaning of the term disability in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). The Amendments Act retains the definition of disability under Section 504 and the ADA but emphasizes that the definition should be interpreted broadly.  Among other things, the Amendments Act directs that the ameliorating effects of mitigating measures (other than ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses) not be considered in determining whether an individual has a disability; expands the scope of "major life activities" by providing a non-exhaustive list of general activities and a non-exhaustive list of major bodily functions; clarifies that an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active; and clarifies the meaning of "regarded as" having a disability, including that individuals "regarded as" having a disability are not entitled to reasonable accommodations or reasonable modifications.
OCR is evaluating the impact of the Amendments Act on OCR's enforcement responsibilities under Section 504 and under Title II of the ADA, including whether any changes in regulations, guidance, or other publications are appropriate.

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)
Background Information
Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The collection was formerly administered as the Elementary and Secondary School Survey.
The CRDC gathers a variety of information including student enrollment and student’s access to educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learner, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights laws for which it is responsible. Information collected by the CRDC is also used by other ED offices as well as policymakers and researchers outside of ED.
For further general information about the CRDC, visit the CRDC FAQ page.
2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs NEW!
On April 18, 2023, OCR received approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to require all local educational agencies (LEA) in the country that receive federal financial assistance from ED, including every public school district, charter schools, juvenile justice facilities, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with disabilities, to respond to the CRDC for the 2021-22 and 2023-24 school years. OCR made changes to the CRDC, including, but not limited to the restoration of long-standing and useful data elements that have been collected in previous CRDCs as well as some new data elements. For more details about changes in the  2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs, please see 2021-22 Questions and Answers  PDF (183K) and 2023-24 Questions and Answers  PDF (181K). OCR will notify LEAs of the dates when they must submit data for the 2021-22 CRDC.

Overview
Legislation, regulations, guidance, and other policy documents can be found here for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and other topics.
Please note that in the U.S., the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.  So, if you have a question about a policy or issue, you may want to check with the relevant organization in your state or school district.

Disability Discrimination
Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act
OCR enforces several Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive Federal funds from the Department of Education. These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.
