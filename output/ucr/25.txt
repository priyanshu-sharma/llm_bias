Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action
The University is committed to non-discrimination, equal employment and affirmative action.  UCR respects the rights of all members of the campus community to equal opportunity  and freedom from harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, citizenship, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity, gender expression and gender transition status), pregnancy, age, disability (mental or physical), medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), genetic information (including family medical history), ancestry, service in the uniformed services (including protected veteran status), marital status, or any other characteristic protected by state or federal law.  The Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (Title IX/EOAA) is dedicated to protecting these rights through:
promotion of the UC's values and policies, with training and education and awareness programs
responding to complaints and grievances of discrimination, harassment and retaliation
implementing UC and campus non-discrimination policies including the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH)
overseeing compliance with laws relating to discrimination and harassment
ensuring that UCR protects the rights of those with disabilities including under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
coordinating campus affirmative action programs and producing the affirmative action plans.
You may contact Title IX/EOAA:

Filing a Report or Complaint
Title IX/EOAA handles reports and complaints of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and other conduct prohibited by anti-discrimination policies and the SVSH Policy.  You may also report incidents of bias, hate and intolerance.
Discrimination is adverse, unequal treatment, such as a personnel action, based on a protected characteristic.
Harassment is a form of discrimination, where the adverse treatment is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic that is intimidating, hostile or offensive and so severe or pervasive that it creates a hostile environment.
Retaliation is adverse action taken against someone for filing a complaint, participating in a complaint resolution process, or engaging in another protected activity.
The full definitions are provided in UCR's Discrimination, Harassment & Retaliation Complaint and Resolution Policy.
To file a report or complaint, including anonymously (if desired):
make an online report of discrimination, harassment, bias, hate, sexual violence, or retaliation
Your report will be promptly reviewed by Office staff.  Typically, we will reach out to you or the person identified as having experienced the discrimination, harassment or retaliation with information and resources and to connect for an intake meeting if appropriate.  Our flowcharts and FAQs provide more information about our assessment and response process.
This reporting form may also be used to report violations of the SVSH Policy; visit the Title IX at UCR website to learn more about the SVSH Policy and programs.
External Reporting Options
UCR encourages students, faculty, and staff to contact the Office of Title IX, Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action with complaints and concerns, so that we have the opportunity to work to address the concern.  We also provide information about how you may report discrimination, harassment (including sexual violence) and retaliation to regulatory entities, outside of UCR.
