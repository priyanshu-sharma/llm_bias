In grade school I loved the teachers and subjects taught - but I really loved recess and the chance to be with friends experiencing the spirit of play and competition.

She also swept the 1,600 and 3,200-meter runs at the 5A state track meet each of her final three seasons.

[Read]\nCatherine Fox - Bishop Miege\nThe majority of college athletes would probably be content with winning one national championship or collecting one All-America honor during their collegiate career.\nCatherine Fox won national titles in five individual events and several relays as a member of the Stanford University women\'s swim team in the 1990s. And she was an All-American in every single event in which she competed. That\'s seven All-America honors each season \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c 28 total in her four-year career as a Cardinal swimmer.\nFox also earned Student Athlete of the Year honors three times at Stanford, set two American swimming records, and was voted into Stanford\'s Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010.

But Dr. Amy Oberhelman is no stranger to hard work.\nOnce she discovered her passion for swimming as a 10-year-old, the Manhattan native dove in with abandon, putting in two workouts a day, six days a week. That had work paid off with eight Kansas high school gold medals, six state records, and recognition as an All-American. It continued to pay off with a scholarship to Stanford. And it led her to medical school and a career as a radiologist.\n\"Swimming takes a lot of time, and there are a lot of sacrifices you have to make along the way,\" Oberhelman said. \"I think that developed my work ethic and my ability to dedicate myself to something. It helped my focus.[Read]\nJanell (Smith) Carson - Fredonia HS\nThe late Janell (Smith) Carson of Fredonia, who passed away in 2020 after a battle with cancer, was one of the greatest girls track and field athletes in Kansas history despite never getting the opportunity to run a single high school race.\nBut Carson, who passed away at the age of 73, was one of many outstanding female athletes in the pre-Title IX era who accentuated the need for the legislation that has changed the lives of countless athletes over the last 50 years.
