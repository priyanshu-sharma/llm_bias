Policies & Procedures
Harvard University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy educational and work environment in which no member of the University community is, on the basis of sex, including sexual orientation or gender identity, excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination in any University program or activity. Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, is a form of sex discrimination in that it denies an individual equal access to the University’s programs or activities.
Harvard University’s policies prohibiting sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct are designed to ensure a safe and non-discriminatory educational and work environment and to meet legal requirements, including: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the University’s programs or activities; relevant sections of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in employment; and Massachusetts laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

Disclose to a Title IX Resource Coordinator
Title IX Resource Coordinators have specialized experience in responding to disclosures of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. They serve in a neutral role, support all members of the Harvard community, and are expert resources around the University’s policies, procedures, and resources in the realm of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. Resource Coordinators serve as the primary point of contact for individuals seeking supportive measures, individualized supports that enable Harvard community members impacted by sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct to access their work or studies.
Contacting your local Title IX Resource Coordinator is not the same as filing a formal complaint with the University Title IX Coordinator. Rather, the Resource Coordinators are a resource to help you make an informed decision about which pathways are right for you.

Regulations & Laws
What is Title IX? Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance from the Department of Education, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.
Read more about Title IX, other federal regulations, and Massachusetts state laws which inform the work of our office.

What is Title IX? Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
Title IX applies to any institution receiving federal financial assistance from the Department of Education, including state and local educational agencies. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funds from the Department of Education must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or because a person made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX.
