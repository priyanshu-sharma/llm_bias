Updated on: June 21, 2022By\nPage Ivey, pivey@mailbox.sc.edu, 803-777-3085\nMolly Peirano, a University of South Carolina alumna who recently led Title IX engagement\nand education initiatives at Ohio State University, has been leading the university\xe2\x80\x99s\nnew Office of Civil Rights and Title IX.\nOn the 50th anniversary of Title IX, UofSC Today talked with Peirano about her plans and goals\nfor the office and the future of the landmark civil rights regulation that prohibits\nsex discrimination in any education program receiving federal funds.\nHistorically, Title IX has focused a lot on athletics, how would you describe the\nfuture of Title IX?\nOften when I'm trying to explain what Title IX is, I start back at the beginning.\nThere was a woman at the University of Maryland who earned her Ph.D. and, when she\nwas trying to get hired, would hear things like, \xe2\x80\x98We already have a woman in this\ndepartment.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You come on too strong for a woman.\xe2\x80\x99 Her name was Bernice Sandler, went\nby Bunny. And she's actually known as the \xe2\x80\x98Godmother of Title IX.\xe2\x80\x99\nSometimes we forget that this started as a faculty issue. When people look back at\nhistory, they think a lot of the athletic aspect, which was very important and brought\na lot of attention that was well deserved. Now I would say we're more in the era of\nsexual misconduct and preventing it, keeping people safe.\nBut I do hope that we can bring some of the attention back to faculty issues and employment\nand scholarship. Even though we've made great strides in equity in those areas, we\nhave a ways to go.\nThe main message I want people to get is \xe2\x80\x98We want you to be treated well by us and\nby one another, regardless of what your identity is.\xe2\x80\x99\nWhat is a contemporary issue that is being seen on campuses that you would like to\naddress?\nIf you look at the number of tenured faculty, you will still see that women are behind\nin those spaces, even just looking at the sheer number. I think looking at those pieces\nis helpful. Another part that often is not talked about in Title IX is pregnant and\nparenting students, who are protected under Title IX.\nI am working on a Ph.D. and that's my area of study. And I can tell you over the last\nfour years, there has been more research done in that space. How do we support pregnant\nstudents \xe2\x80\x94 keep them on our campuses, accommodate them so that they can have their\nchildren? Or if they have a miscarriage, are they able to re-enter or maybe not even\nleave, just have accommodation? I think that's an area that has not gotten the attention\nthat it deserves.\nWhat has been your first order of business in this position?\nOne of the first orders of business has been to create a comprehensive policy that\nis anti-discrimination, anti-harassment and anti-sexual misconduct. Right now, there's\nquite a few policies and it can be confusing for people to follow. And my thing with\npolicy is people need to know what the expectations are if we want them to meet those\nexpectations. Most people want to do the right thing. They just need to know what\nto do. We're creating one comprehensive policy, and we'll retire about six other policies.\nI think that'll help communicate our expectations to the community, let people know\nwhat their rights are, and it will help us be more efficient and effective in our\nwork as an office.\nWe are also adding staff. Two of the first hires that I made are for what we're calling\nan intake function. When people come to the office, they have someone to share their\nexperience with who can help go through what their immediate resources are then what\ntheir resolution options are. We want to restore agency back to people. We want to\nmake sure that instead of just rushing it to an investigation or something like that,\nthat people have time to think through what their options are and talk to someone\nso they can get that support first.\nMolly Peirano says she gets to meet a lot of people when she takes her dog Monty for\nwalks around the Horseshoe.\nHow are you going about creating this new policy?\nThere's a university policy process that we are following. We are doing some benchmarking\nfrom other institutions, and we've also heard the feedback from people who are currently\nhere about what's working and what's not, as well as our own expertise having done\nthis work at other institutions.\nWe also are getting feedback from different stakeholders across the institution. We've\nhad a couple folks look at it from a faculty perspective, from an administration perspective.\nI also visited the undergraduate student government and let them know I would be sending\na copy for feedback. I'm trying to get input from different folks, but we also want\nto have it in place by the beginning of the new school year so we can have a fresh\nstart and launch our office more publicly.\nI tell people, \xe2\x80\x98We don't want to put up a new front door if there's nothing new behind\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 We wanted any publicity to coincide with the policy, so people see we are delivering\nsomething more streamlined, easier to understand.\nHow did you get into this this line of work?\nI knew I wanted to be in higher education. I had worked in sorority and fraternity\nlife when I was an undergrad. Then I was a consultant and went to a lot of different\ncollege campuses. And I went back to school and got my master's \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0at the University\nof South Carolina \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0and I worked in student conduct while I was there. When I moved\nback to Ohio after grad school, I did not have a role that I wanted to accept yet.\nSo I volunteered and got trained as a hospital advocate. I would go into the hospitals\nand be present with survivors of sexual assault while they were going through their\nnurse-examiner experience. After that, I realized that was an area I wanted to work\nin.\nEventually I got a role at Ohio State in Title IX, which I think kind of coupled the\nstudent conduct \xe2\x80\x94 the expectations/accountability piece \xe2\x80\x94 with the victim/survivor\nsupport piece. And it kind of brought those two worlds together.\nWhat brought you back to USC?\nI was in the Title IX job at Ohio State when I went to a wedding for a graduate school\nclassmate, and someone said South Carolina was opening a Title IX office and \xe2\x80\x98You\ncould just come back and work with us.\xe2\x80\x99 I looked at the posting and realized that\nit was a similar office to what I had done at Ohio State. And USC is an institution\nthat means a lot to me. I knew there were going to be challenges, but I really think\nthat the people at USC deserve having that access, having their options presented\nin an easy-to-understand way. So I just put my name in and thought, \xe2\x80\x98Well, if it's\nmeant to be, it will be.\xe2\x80\x99\nWhat is your early impression of the university\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to working on these issues?\nI was very impressed with all the work that had been done before I got here. You had\nthe Title IX task force and its report. There was a lot of acknowledgement that there\nis a better way for us to serve people in this space. So I definitely appreciated\nthat. I am also very grateful for how they've situated the office \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0I report to the\npresident's chief of staff, which I think is very wise. And so it shows me that this\nis a priority for the institution and they strategically placed it so that we can\nbe integrated in the work of the university but also have the autonomy to do what\nis right. I think that is very powerful for an institution.\nBefore I even came to USC, I got a call from President-elect Michael Amiridis, and\nhe shared how important this work was and that he was looking forward to working together\non this. To me, that said a lot that a president was willing and able to say that\nthis is a priority. Based on the work he did where he's coming from, it's not just\nthat he's saying it, he really lives it.\nDo you ever foresee a time when it won't be necessary to have a Title IX coordinator\non a college campus?\nI think that anyone who's in prevention work hopes that they can work themselves out\nof a job. And honestly, there's so much work to do, not just at USC, but I would say\nnationwide. I would love to say, of course we can get there. But I do think that sometimes\nwe get complacent, and people think \xe2\x80\x98Oh, it's improved from 1972, so we're in good\nshape.\xe2\x80\x99 But like I said, if you look at the percentage of tenured faculty or if you\nlook at the pregnant and parenting students or the other areas, we have to stay on\ntop of it. If we don't keep it top of mind, it's easy to slide back and we still have\nso much work to do. I know people deserve better.\nPeople need to know what the expectations are if we want them to meet those expectations.\nMost people want to do the right thing. They just need to know what to do.\nYour work is very intense. How do you relax? What do you do for fun?\nI love to travel, so I'm very excited that it is kind of becoming more available and\nfeels safer for me to do that.\nI have a little 3-pound teacup Yorkie that I love to spend time with. His name is\nMonty, so he is a bundle of fun. I had a late meeting with students one night and\nI had just moved, so I didn't want to leave him alone yet. So I brought him. And as\nI was walking him across campus, I met more people with him than I had the whole first\nmonth I was here. So I told I told my boss, this could be a good idea just to walk\nhim around campus every couple of weeks and meet a bunch of people.\nI also try to work out because I always tell my employees in the office, \xe2\x80\x98You have\nto be well, to do well.\xe2\x80\x99 So I do try to run and exercise throughout the week.\nI volunteer for other organizations because to your point, this can be so heavy. So\nit's nice to have like other things that require your time and attention. I volunteer\nwith Delta Gamma, which is an international sorority. I work with different collegians\nacross the country, and that's rejuvenating.\nIs there anything else you would like to add?\nI think the biggest thing about Title IX is there's all these other areas from recruitment\nto admissions to helping people have a good experience while they're here that we\ndon't talk about. We should look at how are we bringing people to our institution\nand making sure that they have the learning and working environment that they deserve\nso they can go on and do great things. The main message I want people to get is \xe2\x80\x98We\nwant you to be treated well by us and by one another, regardless of what your identity\nis.\xe2\x80\x99\nShare this Story!
