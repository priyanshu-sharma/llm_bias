Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs or activities, and protects all students, faculty, staff and visitors from sex-based discrimination. Some examples of education programs and activities subject to Title IX include admissions, academic instruction, residence life, athletics, extracurricular activities, employment, hiring, and other on-campus or off-campus activities organized or sponsored by an institution. The regulations implementing Title IX require educational institutions to follow a strict process when responding to reports or complaints of sex discrimination, and provide support for parties involved in the process, including autonomy for a complainant when deciding how to proceed.\nThere are many forms of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Title IX also prohibits discrimination based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as pregnancy and parenting, childbirth and related medical conditions. Title IX prohibits retaliation against an individual who asserts any right or privilege under Title IX, or because the individual has made a report or Title IX complaint, or participated or refused to participate in the Title IX process.\nAs a recipient of federal funding, USC Upstate is required by Title IX regulations to operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. USC Upstate is committed to providing an environment for working, learning and living that promotes equal opportunity, inclusiveness and nondiscrimination, where students, faculty, staff and visitors are protected from all forms of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct (sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, stalking), and related retaliation.\nHow We Can Help You\nWe are here to\xe2\x80\xa6\nExplain the university's policies and procedures prohibiting sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and related retaliation;\nConnect complainants and respondents to supportive measures and resources;\nReview the options available at the university when making a report or Title IX complaint;\nAdvise complainants and respondents of their rights and resources;\nInvestigate claims of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and retaliation;\nEngage in resolution.\nTitle IX Violation Report\nIf you or someone you know has been the victim of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, or retaliation, at USC Upstate, you can report it.
