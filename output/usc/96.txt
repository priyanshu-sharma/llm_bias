Title IX
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
Title IX of theEducation Amendments of 1972
What You Should Know About Title IX
Title IX is a federal law and applies to educational institutions that receive federal funding. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs or activities, and protects all students, faculty, staff and visitors from sex-based discrimination. Some examples of education programs and activities subject to Title IX include admissions, academic instruction, residence life, athletics, extracurricular activities, employment, hiring, and other on-campus or off-campus activities organized or sponsored by an institution. The regulations implementing Title IX require educational institutions to follow a strict process when responding to reports or complaints of sex discrimination, and provide support for parties involved in the process, including autonomy for a complainant when deciding how to proceed.
There are many forms of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Title IX also prohibits discrimination based on an individual’s sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as pregnancy and parenting, childbirth and related medical conditions. Title IX prohibits retaliation against an individual who asserts any right or privilege under Title IX, or because the individual has made a report or Title IX complaint, or participated or refused to participate in the Title IX process.
As a recipient of federal funding, USC Upstate is required by Title IX regulations to operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. USC Upstate is committed to providing an environment for working, learning and living that promotes equal opportunity, inclusiveness and nondiscrimination, where students, faculty, staff and visitors are protected from all forms of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct (sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, stalking), and related retaliation.
