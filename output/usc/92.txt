My professors at South Carolina Law have equipped me with a rich insight into our
legal system while also helping me grow as a professional in the way I write, present,

Our People
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX is on a mission to create an environment where
all people are treated with dignity and respect and have an equal opportunity to learn
and work at a university free from discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct.
Report an Incident
If you or someone you know has been the victim/survivor of discrimination or harassment
at the University of South Carolina, you can report it. Please know this does not
automatically initiate an investigation or notify the alleged person, but can connect
those impacted with staff to discuss options.
Our Location
Our office is located on the fourth floor of the James F. Byrnes building inside suite
401.
The main message I want people to get is ‘We want you to be treated well by us and
by one another, regardless of what your identity is.’
Molly Peirano, Assistant Vice President for Civil Rights and Title IX/Title IX & ADA
