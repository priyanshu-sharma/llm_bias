Students, faculty and staff members can talk to a trained interpersonal\nviolence advocate.\nTitle IX Task Force\nInitially announced on March 15, 2021 and then formally launched on March 26, the\nTitle IX Task Force is an interdisciplinary team of students, faculty and staff formed\nto undertake a comprehensive review of processes, policies, communications, training\nand historic activity, and determine institutional capacity and effectiveness to support\nthe safety of the community and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment or\ninterpersonal violence.\nIn the two months that followed, the 15 Task Force members \xe2\x80\x93 under the leadership of Dr. Kirsten Kennedy, associate vice president for Housing\nand Sustainability and Dr. Audrey Korsgaard, chair-elect of the Faculty Senate and\nprofessor of Management and director of the Riegel and Emory Human Resources Center\nat the Darla Moore School of Business \xe2\x80\x93 reviewed policies, studied procedures, tracked\ntraining, studied existing education and programs, interviewed subject matter experts,\nand considered resourcing levels currently in use across the university. With support\nfrom the nationally recognized team from Cozen O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s Institutional Response Group,\nthe final report of the Task Force identifies areas for further review and offers\ninsight into ways the university can improve the campus safety environment and create\nan ecosystem of care for those impacted by interpersonal violence.\nAudit and Advisory Services Report\nSimultaneous to the Task Force process, the Board of Trustees tasked Audit and Advisory\nServices with the responsibility to review select historic cases and determine compliance\nwith applicable policies, regulations and laws in place to govern Title IX activity.\nThe report, titled \"Title IX Process Review for Select Cases,\" was issued to the Board\nof Trustees on June 25, 2021.\nView the Audit and Advisory Services Report \xc2\xbb\nTitle IX Task Force Report\nWhile the work of the Audit and Advisory Services team found university policies and\nprocedures met the appropriate national standards and requirements that govern the\nuniversity\xe2\x80\x99s work in this area, the Task Force recognizes those standards create a\nthreshold of compliance, and believes that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve\nupon processes for continuous review and strengthening of systems that balance and\nsupport the needs of both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force\xe2\x80\x99s findings\npoint to several such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution\nhas made and the diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community\nsafe each day.\nThe challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force\xe2\x80\x99s\nrecommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations address\nthree core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV\nviolations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants\nand respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:\nall members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability\nfor stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,\nthrough training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond\neffectively to SHV.\nFinally, the work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university\ncommunity\xe2\x80\x99s response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide clarity on some underlying\nproblems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report\nserves to guide the work of the Implementation Group and Cozen O\xe2\x80\x99Connor who will continue\nto work with members of the Task Force and key university leaders to further develop\nand implement these recommendations.\nBoth the Task Force Report and the Audit and Advisory Services Report were released\nin a letter from Interim President Harris Pastides to all students, faculty and staff on July 1, 2021.\nView the Full Report \xc2\xbb\nImplementation Group\nWith the findings of both the Audit and Advisory Services case review and the Task\nForce report serving as the foundation for understanding, the university has assembled\nan implementation group\xc2\xa0charged by Interim President Harris Pastides with the responsibility to quickly develop\nand implement the actions necessary to improve the university\xe2\x80\x99s response to issues\nrelated to Title IX and interpersonal violence.

While the Task Force\xe2\x80\x99s findings point to several\nsuch areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the\ndiligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community safe each day.\nFindings\nOverall Trends\nThe annual rate of reported cases of SHV was fairly stable, relative to the growth\nin the institution\xe2\x80\x99s size. The rates are lower than estimated national rates of SHV.\nMost complaints concerned students against other students. Incidents involving faculty\nrespondents and student complaints were relatively rare.\nTraining and Education\nTraining for stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, managers) and for implementers\n(staff providing SHV services) are all lacking in frequency and customized content.\nOf note is the need for specialized training for professionals directly involved in\naddressing SHV and managers of employees involved in cases of SHV.\nReporting\nThe current reporting system is difficult to navigate, and the process of reporting\nis an adverse and potentially re-traumatizing experience, creating significant barriers\nto reporting and pursuing a complaint.\nInvestigation\nFew reported cases are formally investigated, with a large proportion of complainants\nopting out. Further, cases against faculty are less likely to result in a reasonable\ncause finding than those against student and staff.\nDisciplining\nThere is no faculty-governed process for disciplinary action short of termination\nfor faculty. Further, there is inconsistency in documentation and execution of discipline\nfor faculty and staff. There is a lack of guidelines regarding handling conduct that\nfalls short of policy violation but is nonetheless inappropriate.\nAdvocacy\nThere is a lack of continual review of risk to the complainant, which may undermine\nmeasures to protect against further harassment and retaliation. While support is offered\nto student respondents through the Respondent Resource Committee, in practice, few\nstudent respondents utilize these services.\nBroader areas of concern\nStaffing, job scope, reporting structures, and coordinating mechanisms require attention.\nThere is a lack of centralized information management and public reporting. The culture\nof the institution and students does not reflect a shared commitment to addressing\nSHV.\nRecommendations\nThe challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force\xe2\x80\x99s\nrecommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations address\nthree core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV\nviolations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants\nand respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:\nall members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability\nfor stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,\nthrough training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond\neffectively to SHV. Specifically we recommend:\nIncrease the frequency and tracking of training and education activities and expand\nofferings to targeted populations.\nImprove both complainant and respondent experiences through the reporting and investigating\nprocess by reviewing all websites, forms and communications to be more user-friendly,\ninterpersonally sensitive and non-threatening to both complainant and respondent.\nDevelop and maintain investigative protocols and rubrics for evaluations of cases.\nDocument cases in a manner that is consistent with protocols and rubrics. Review cases\nto assure adherence to policy, protocols and rubrics.\nCreate a system to assure that the disciplinary actions are consistently delivered.\nCreate guidelines for corrective action and monitoring of inappropriate behavior that\nfalls short of policy violation. Develop procedures for consistent, thorough and centralized\nrecord keeping of disciplinary and corrective action. Revise the Faculty Manual and/or\npolicy to address faculty misconduct and discipline.\nDevelop trauma-informed first responder protocols to ensure that no matter which reporting\noffice receives the report, the complainant receives consistent information about\nsupport services and reporting options. Continually assess ongoing risk to complainants\nand revise supportive measures accordingly.\nEvaluate the organization structure to maximize effectiveness with particular attention\nto deputy Title IX coordinator role, the coordination between academic units and the\nSHV offices, and the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) line of reporting.\nConsolidate information management and annual reporting. Work toward a culture of\ncollaboration, accountability and trust.\nNext Steps\nThe work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university community\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponse to SHV. Further work is needed to provide further clarity on some underlying\nproblems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report\nserves to guide the work of Cozen O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, an external firm engaged by the University\nwho will continue to work with members of the task force to further develop and implement\nthese recommendations.\nFull Report\nIntroduction\nOverview\nFindings\nChanges Made or In-progress\nRecommendations\nConclusion\nReferences and Appendices\nInterpersonal Violence\nUofSC Facebook\nUofSC Instagram\nUofSC Twitter\nColleges & Schools\nArts and Sciences\nBusiness\nEducation\nEngineering and Computing\nThe Graduate School\nHospitality, Retail and Sport Management\nInformation and Communications\nLaw\nMedicine (Columbia)\nMedicine (Greenville)\nMusic\nNursing\nPharmacy\nPublic Health\nSocial Work\nSouth Carolina Honors College\nOffices & Divisions\nEmployment\nUndergraduate Admissions\nFinancial Aid and Scholarships\nBursar (fee payment)\nVeterans and Military Services\nDisability Resources\nAccess and Opportunity\nHuman Resources\nLaw Enforcement and Safety\nUniversity Libraries\nAll Offices and Divisions\nTools\nCarolina Alert\nCampus Email\nmy.sc.edu\nBlackboard\nCampus Safety and Wellness\nPeopleSoft Finance\nUniversity of South Carolina\nPrivacy\nStudent Consumer Information\nStudent Consumer Information\nTransparency Initiative\nCivil Rights and Title IX\nDigital Accessibility\nContact\nContact\nChallenge the conventional.
