Title IX
The University of South Carolina is committed to supporting the safety of the entire
university community and responding to all acts or threats of sexual harassment or
interpersonal violence.
Getting Help
Call 803-777-8248 or drop in to Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention
during business hours. Students, faculty and staff members can talk to a trained interpersonal
violence advocate.
Title IX Task Force
Initially announced on March 15, 2021 and then formally launched on March 26, the
Title IX Task Force is an interdisciplinary team of students, faculty and staff formed
to undertake a comprehensive review of processes, policies, communications, training
and historic activity, and determine institutional capacity and effectiveness to support
the safety of the community and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment or
interpersonal violence.
In the two months that followed, the 15 Task Force members – under the leadership of Dr. Kirsten Kennedy, associate vice president for Housing
and Sustainability and Dr. Audrey Korsgaard, chair-elect of the Faculty Senate and
professor of Management and director of the Riegel and Emory Human Resources Center
at the Darla Moore School of Business – reviewed policies, studied procedures, tracked
training, studied existing education and programs, interviewed subject matter experts,
and considered resourcing levels currently in use across the university. With support
from the nationally recognized team from Cozen O’Connor’s Institutional Response Group,
the final report of the Task Force identifies areas for further review and offers
insight into ways the university can improve the campus safety environment and create
an ecosystem of care for those impacted by interpersonal violence.
Audit and Advisory Services Report
Simultaneous to the Task Force process, the Board of Trustees tasked Audit and Advisory
Services with the responsibility to review select historic cases and determine compliance
with applicable policies, regulations and laws in place to govern Title IX activity.
The report, titled "Title IX Process Review for Select Cases," was issued to the Board
of Trustees on June 25, 2021.

Title IX Task Force Report
While the work of the Audit and Advisory Services team found university policies and
procedures met the appropriate national standards and requirements that govern the
university’s work in this area, the Task Force recognizes those standards create a
threshold of compliance, and believes that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve
upon processes for continuous review and strengthening of systems that balance and
support the needs of both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings
point to several such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution
has made and the diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community
safe each day.
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
effectively to SHV.
Finally, the work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university
community’s response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report
serves to guide the work of the Implementation Group and Cozen O’Connor who will continue
to work with members of the Task Force and key university leaders to further develop
and implement these recommendations.
Both the Task Force Report and the Audit and Advisory Services Report were released
in a letter from Interim President Harris Pastides to all students, faculty and staff on July 1, 2021.

Implementation Group
With the findings of both the Audit and Advisory Services case review and the Task
Force report serving as the foundation for understanding, the university has assembled
an implementation group charged by Interim President Harris Pastides with the responsibility to quickly develop
and implement the actions necessary to improve the university’s response to issues
related to Title IX and interpersonal violence. The group is co-led by Dr. Stacy Fritz
and Dr. Bill Pruitt.

Laws and Policies
Interpersonal violence is prohibited by federal legislation and University of South
Carolina policy, which guide the university's efforts in prevention, reporting and
response.
These laws, acts and policies are administered by various entities within the university.
The brief descriptions below explain how the items relate to interpersonal violence,
and the link connects you to the appropriate office for more information.
Title IX
Title IX protects students from gender discrimination, including sexual violence and
sexual harassment. The university's Title IX coordinator oversees Title IX-related
policies and procedures, including complaints, investigations and resolutions.
Clery Act
The Clery Act sets standards for documenting and publicizing campus crime statistics.
The university’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report includes information and crime
statistics for the three previous years. Our Law Enforcement and Safety division monitors
the statistics and produces the report.
Campus SaVE Act
The Campus SaVE Act prescribes requirements for campus sexual assault prevention,
reporting and discipline. The act is an element of the 2013 reauthorization of the
Violence Against Women Act and an amendment to the Clery Act.
University Policies
In addition to federal, state and local laws, university policies govern the behavior
of members of the university community, who are expected to comply on and off campus.
Acts of sexual violence, harassment and discrimination are not tolerated and are a
violation of university policy. The provost coordinates university policy.
Good Samaritan Policy
Consistent with the sentiment behind Chapter 53, Title 44, Article 19, of the Code
of Laws for South Carolina (Drug or Alcohol-Related Overdose Medical Treatment), any
student who files a complaint or who acts as a third-party witness in an investigation
under this policy will not be subject to punitive disciplinary action by the office
of student conduct for using and/or consuming alcohol or drugs at or near the time
of the alleged incident, provided that any such alcohol or drug use does not place
the health or safety of any other student at risk.
University Policies
The Department of Education released new regulations that took effect on Aug. 14,
2020. The university currently operates under EOP 1.06. Understanding this policy is important to help you determine what your next steps

Title IX Task Force
The Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive
Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
violence.
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Charge
Action item No. 3, from the president’s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the president’s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
this effort.
Process
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,
policies, training, communications, historic activity, capacity and effectiveness.
At the conclusion of the review period, the team will recommend to the president and
the cabinet sustainable long-term approaches, action steps, structure and funding
requirements intended to improve the institution’s ability to prevent and respond
to sexual misconduct. The review will include but not be limited to recommendations
in the following areas:
Review the current policy for feedback on the following areas: (a) coherence with federal guidance; (b) general
readability and understanding; (c) relation to other preexisting policies related
to harassment and discrimination; and (d) recommendations for education surrounding
the separation of policies relating to Title IX, Title VII and the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
A mapping of UofSC’s current processes and procedures for the reporting and adjudicating concerns and complaints of sexual misconduct and
interpersonal violence.
A review of processes currently in place to train faculty, staff and students on their Title IX obligations as well as recommend future initiatives.
A review of communications, education and programmatic initiatives currently in place to prevent sexual misconduct, to inform and educate reporting
practices. Review should include web presence, readability of process maps, respondent
services, and other visual guides.
Best-practice organizational structures, processes and appeals mechanisms within higher education and within private industry that are designed to respond
to the issues under review to include a review of the current work group, policy group
and communications group.
Resources identified that are lacking or necessary to improve in this effort.
Scope

examine. In addition, and if necessary or requested, the task force will secure outside
support or expertise to inform their analysis and recommendations.
Outcome
The final product of the review will be recommendations for improving processes, procedures,
communication and education; a draft timeline for improvement implementation; initial
budgeting needed to implement the recommendations; and other actions necessary to
improve university systems.
Timeline
The team will have an initial period of 45-days to conduct its review. Of note, however,
is the ability of the president to extend the work of the team beyond this initial
time period should conditions warrant.

Title IX Task Force Report
The Title IX Task Force was charged by former President Caslen to critically evaluate
the institution’s effectiveness in addressing sexual harassment and violence (SHV)
and to offer recommendations to enhance the institution’s effectiveness in addressing
SHV.
Guided by principles of respect, accountability, and empowerment, the Task Force believes
that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve processes to support the needs of
both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings point to several
such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the
diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community safe each day.
Findings
Overall Trends
The annual rate of reported cases of SHV was fairly stable, relative to the growth
in the institution’s size. The rates are lower than estimated national rates of SHV.
Most complaints concerned students against other students. Incidents involving faculty
respondents and student complaints were relatively rare.
Training and Education
Training for stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, managers) and for implementers
(staff providing SHV services) are all lacking in frequency and customized content.
Of note is the need for specialized training for professionals directly involved in
addressing SHV and managers of employees involved in cases of SHV.
Reporting
The current reporting system is difficult to navigate, and the process of reporting
is an adverse and potentially re-traumatizing experience, creating significant barriers
to reporting and pursuing a complaint.
Investigation
Few reported cases are formally investigated, with a large proportion of complainants
opting out. Further, cases against faculty are less likely to result in a reasonable
cause finding than those against student and staff.
Disciplining
There is no faculty-governed process for disciplinary action short of termination
for faculty. Further, there is inconsistency in documentation and execution of discipline
for faculty and staff. There is a lack of guidelines regarding handling conduct that
falls short of policy violation but is nonetheless inappropriate.
Advocacy
There is a lack of continual review of risk to the complainant, which may undermine
measures to protect against further harassment and retaliation. While support is offered
to student respondents through the Respondent Resource Committee, in practice, few
student respondents utilize these services.
Broader areas of concern
Staffing, job scope, reporting structures, and coordinating mechanisms require attention.
There is a lack of centralized information management and public reporting. The culture
of the institution and students does not reflect a shared commitment to addressing
SHV.
Recommendations
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
effectively to SHV. Specifically we recommend:
Increase the frequency and tracking of training and education activities and expand
offerings to targeted populations.
Improve both complainant and respondent experiences through the reporting and investigating
process by reviewing all websites, forms and communications to be more user-friendly,
interpersonally sensitive and non-threatening to both complainant and respondent.
Develop and maintain investigative protocols and rubrics for evaluations of cases.
Document cases in a manner that is consistent with protocols and rubrics. Review cases
to assure adherence to policy, protocols and rubrics.
Create a system to assure that the disciplinary actions are consistently delivered.
Create guidelines for corrective action and monitoring of inappropriate behavior that
falls short of policy violation. Develop procedures for consistent, thorough and centralized
record keeping of disciplinary and corrective action. Revise the Faculty Manual and/or
policy to address faculty misconduct and discipline.
Develop trauma-informed first responder protocols to ensure that no matter which reporting
office receives the report, the complainant receives consistent information about
support services and reporting options. Continually assess ongoing risk to complainants
and revise supportive measures accordingly.
Evaluate the organization structure to maximize effectiveness with particular attention
to deputy Title IX coordinator role, the coordination between academic units and the
SHV offices, and the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) line of reporting.
Consolidate information management and annual reporting. Work toward a culture of
collaboration, accountability and trust.
Next Steps
The work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university community’s
response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide further clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report
serves to guide the work of Cozen O’Connor, an external firm engaged by the University
who will continue to work with members of the task force to further develop and implement
these recommendations.

Laws and Policies
Interpersonal violence is prohibited by federal legislation and University of South
Carolina policy, which guide the university's efforts in prevention, reporting and
response.
These laws, acts and policies are administered by various entities within the university.
The brief descriptions below explain how the items relate to interpersonal violence,
and the link connects you to the appropriate office for more information.
Title IX
Title IX protects students from gender discrimination, including sexual violence and
sexual harassment. The university's Title IX coordinator oversees Title IX-related
policies and procedures, including complaints, investigations and resolutions.
Clery Act
The Clery Act sets standards for documenting and publicizing campus crime statistics.
The university’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report includes information and crime
statistics for the three previous years. Our Law Enforcement and Safety division monitors
the statistics and produces the report.
Campus SaVE Act
The Campus SaVE Act prescribes requirements for campus sexual assault prevention,
reporting and discipline. The act is an element of the 2013 reauthorization of the
Violence Against Women Act and an amendment to the Clery Act.
University Policies
In addition to federal, state and local laws, university policies govern the behavior
of members of the university community, who are expected to comply on and off campus.

Title IX
The University of South Carolina is committed to supporting the safety of the entire
university community and responding to all acts or threats of sexual harassment or
interpersonal violence.
Getting Help
Call 803-777-8248 or drop in to Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention
during business hours. Students, faculty and staff members can talk to a trained interpersonal
violence advocate.
Title IX Task Force
Initially announced on March 15, 2021 and then formally launched on March 26, the
Title IX Task Force is an interdisciplinary team of students, faculty and staff formed
to undertake a comprehensive review of processes, policies, communications, training
and historic activity, and determine institutional capacity and effectiveness to support
the safety of the community and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment or
interpersonal violence.
In the two months that followed, the 15 Task Force members – under the leadership of Dr. Kirsten Kennedy, associate vice president for Housing
and Sustainability and Dr. Audrey Korsgaard, chair-elect of the Faculty Senate and
professor of Management and director of the Riegel and Emory Human Resources Center
at the Darla Moore School of Business – reviewed policies, studied procedures, tracked
training, studied existing education and programs, interviewed subject matter experts,
and considered resourcing levels currently in use across the university. With support
from the nationally recognized team from Cozen O’Connor’s Institutional Response Group,
the final report of the Task Force identifies areas for further review and offers
insight into ways the university can improve the campus safety environment and create
an ecosystem of care for those impacted by interpersonal violence.
Audit and Advisory Services Report
Simultaneous to the Task Force process, the Board of Trustees tasked Audit and Advisory
Services with the responsibility to review select historic cases and determine compliance
with applicable policies, regulations and laws in place to govern Title IX activity.
The report, titled "Title IX Process Review for Select Cases," was issued to the Board
of Trustees on June 25, 2021.
View the Audit and Advisory Services Report »
Title IX Task Force Report
While the work of the Audit and Advisory Services team found university policies and
procedures met the appropriate national standards and requirements that govern the
university’s work in this area, the Task Force recognizes those standards create a
threshold of compliance, and believes that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve
upon processes for continuous review and strengthening of systems that balance and
support the needs of both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings
point to several such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution
has made and the diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community
safe each day.
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
effectively to SHV.
Finally, the work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university
community’s response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report
serves to guide the work of the Implementation Group and Cozen O’Connor who will continue
to work with members of the Task Force and key university leaders to further develop
and implement these recommendations.
Both the Task Force Report and the Audit and Advisory Services Report were released
in a letter from Interim President Harris Pastides to all students, faculty and staff on July 1, 2021.

Implementation Group
With the findings of both the Audit and Advisory Services case review and the Task
Force report serving as the foundation for understanding, the university has assembled
an implementation group charged by Interim President Harris Pastides with the responsibility to quickly develop
and implement the actions necessary to improve the university’s response to issues
related to Title IX and interpersonal violence. The group is co-led by Dr. Stacy Fritz
and Dr. Bill Pruitt.

Title IX Task Force
The Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive
Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
violence.
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Charge
Action item No. 3, from the president’s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the president’s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
this effort.
Process
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,
policies, training, communications, historic activity, capacity and effectiveness.
At the conclusion of the review period, the team will recommend to the president and
the cabinet sustainable long-term approaches, action steps, structure and funding
requirements intended to improve the institution’s ability to prevent and respond
to sexual misconduct. The review will include but not be limited to recommendations
in the following areas:
Review the current policy for feedback on the following areas: (a) coherence with federal guidance; (b) general
readability and understanding; (c) relation to other preexisting policies related
to harassment and discrimination; and (d) recommendations for education surrounding
the separation of policies relating to Title IX, Title VII and the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
A mapping of UofSC’s current processes and procedures for the reporting and adjudicating concerns and complaints of sexual misconduct and
interpersonal violence.
A review of processes currently in place to train faculty, staff and students on their Title IX obligations as well as recommend future initiatives.
A review of communications, education and programmatic initiatives currently in place to prevent sexual misconduct, to inform and educate reporting
practices. Review should include web presence, readability of process maps, respondent
services, and other visual guides.
Best-practice organizational structures, processes and appeals mechanisms within higher education and within private industry that are designed to respond
to the issues under review to include a review of the current work group, policy group
and communications group.
Resources identified that are lacking or necessary to improve in this effort.
Scope
The comprehensive review will examine all aspects of the institution’s efforts to
effectively implement Title IX efforts to include: education, communications, reporting,
investigation, adjudication, advocacy, support and care. The comprehensive review
will have access to all information and resources that the task force would like to
examine. In addition, and if necessary or requested, the task force will secure outside
support or expertise to inform their analysis and recommendations.
Outcome
The final product of the review will be recommendations for improving processes, procedures,
communication and education; a draft timeline for improvement implementation; initial
budgeting needed to implement the recommendations; and other actions necessary to
improve university systems.
Timeline
The team will have an initial period of 45-days to conduct its review. Of note, however,
is the ability of the president to extend the work of the team beyond this initial
time period should conditions warrant.

The Title IX Task Force is comprised of two key components and enabled by the entire

Title IX Task Force Report
The Title IX Task Force was charged by former President Caslen to critically evaluate
the institution’s effectiveness in addressing sexual harassment and violence (SHV)
and to offer recommendations to enhance the institution’s effectiveness in addressing
SHV.
Guided by principles of respect, accountability, and empowerment, the Task Force believes
that as a flagship university, UofSC can improve processes to support the needs of
both complainants and respondents. While the Task Force’s findings point to several
such areas, it also acknowledges the investments the institution has made and the
diligence of the many employees who strive to keep our community safe each day.
Findings
Overall Trends
The annual rate of reported cases of SHV was fairly stable, relative to the growth
in the institution’s size. The rates are lower than estimated national rates of SHV.
Most complaints concerned students against other students. Incidents involving faculty
respondents and student complaints were relatively rare.
Training and Education
Training for stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, managers) and for implementers
(staff providing SHV services) are all lacking in frequency and customized content.
Of note is the need for specialized training for professionals directly involved in
addressing SHV and managers of employees involved in cases of SHV.
Reporting
The current reporting system is difficult to navigate, and the process of reporting
is an adverse and potentially re-traumatizing experience, creating significant barriers
to reporting and pursuing a complaint.
Investigation
Few reported cases are formally investigated, with a large proportion of complainants
opting out. Further, cases against faculty are less likely to result in a reasonable
cause finding than those against student and staff.
Disciplining
There is no faculty-governed process for disciplinary action short of termination
for faculty. Further, there is inconsistency in documentation and execution of discipline
for faculty and staff. There is a lack of guidelines regarding handling conduct that
falls short of policy violation but is nonetheless inappropriate.
Advocacy
There is a lack of continual review of risk to the complainant, which may undermine
measures to protect against further harassment and retaliation. While support is offered
to student respondents through the Respondent Resource Committee, in practice, few
student respondents utilize these services.
Broader areas of concern
Staffing, job scope, reporting structures, and coordinating mechanisms require attention.
There is a lack of centralized information management and public reporting. The culture
of the institution and students does not reflect a shared commitment to addressing
SHV.
Recommendations
The challenges faced by the institution are complex and systemic, and the Task Force’s
recommendations reflect this complexity. The Task Force’s recommendations address
three core principles. The first is respect: the process of addressing potential SHV
violations must be conducted in a manner that respects the rights of both complainants
and respondents and be conducted with interpersonal sensitivity. The second is accountability:
all members of the university community need to recognize their shared accountability
for stopping SHV. The third is empowerment: all members of the UofSC community should,
through training, information sharing, and trust in the system, be empowered to respond
effectively to SHV. Specifically we recommend:
Increase the frequency and tracking of training and education activities and expand
offerings to targeted populations.
Improve both complainant and respondent experiences through the reporting and investigating
process by reviewing all websites, forms and communications to be more user-friendly,
interpersonally sensitive and non-threatening to both complainant and respondent.
Develop and maintain investigative protocols and rubrics for evaluations of cases.
Document cases in a manner that is consistent with protocols and rubrics. Review cases
to assure adherence to policy, protocols and rubrics.
Create a system to assure that the disciplinary actions are consistently delivered.
Create guidelines for corrective action and monitoring of inappropriate behavior that
falls short of policy violation. Develop procedures for consistent, thorough and centralized
record keeping of disciplinary and corrective action. Revise the Faculty Manual and/or
policy to address faculty misconduct and discipline.
Develop trauma-informed first responder protocols to ensure that no matter which reporting
office receives the report, the complainant receives consistent information about
support services and reporting options. Continually assess ongoing risk to complainants
and revise supportive measures accordingly.
Evaluate the organization structure to maximize effectiveness with particular attention
to deputy Title IX coordinator role, the coordination between academic units and the
SHV offices, and the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) line of reporting.
Consolidate information management and annual reporting. Work toward a culture of
collaboration, accountability and trust.
Next Steps
The work of the Task Force represents the first step in improving the university community’s
response to SHV. Further work is needed to provide further clarity on some underlying
problems, benchmark best practices, and implement changes. Accordingly, this report
serves to guide the work of Cozen O’Connor, an external firm engaged by the University
who will continue to work with members of the task force to further develop and implement
these recommendations.

Title IX Task Force
The Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive
Review Team (Title IX Task Force) has been charged with conducting a comprehensive
review of the entire system related to acts or threats of sexual harassment or interpersonal
violence.
On Monday, March 15, 2021, President Caslen, in consultation with the Board of Trustees
and senior campus leaders, put in place a series of deliberate actions that collectively
are intended to ensure the transparent review and purposeful improvement of efforts
intended to reduce sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence
within the University of South Carolina community. One of these important actions
is the conduct of an internal comprehensive review of the entire system and process.
Charge
Action item No. 3, from the president’s letter, calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary
team of faculty, staff and students who will undertake a comprehensive review of processes,
policies, communications, training and historic activity, and determine institutional
capacity to effectively prevent and respond to acts or threats of sexual harassment
or interpersonal violence. At the president’s directive, senior leaders then nominated
key individuals to lead and serve on the Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and
Interpersonal Violence Comprehensive Review Team (Title IX Task Force) undertaking
this effort.
Process
Over a 45-day period, conduct a holistic and comprehensive review of our processes,
policies, training, communications, historic activity, capacity and effectiveness.
At the conclusion of the review period, the team will recommend to the president and
the cabinet sustainable long-term approaches, action steps, structure and funding
requirements intended to improve the institution’s ability to prevent and respond
to sexual misconduct. The review will include but not be limited to recommendations
in the following areas:
Review the current policy for feedback on the following areas: (a) coherence with federal guidance; (b) general
readability and understanding; (c) relation to other preexisting policies related
to harassment and discrimination; and (d) recommendations for education surrounding
the separation of policies relating to Title IX, Title VII and the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
A mapping of UofSC’s current processes and procedures for the reporting and adjudicating concerns and complaints of sexual misconduct and
interpersonal violence.
A review of processes currently in place to train faculty, staff and students on their Title IX obligations as well as recommend future initiatives.
A review of communications, education and programmatic initiatives currently in place to prevent sexual misconduct, to inform and educate reporting
practices. Review should include web presence, readability of process maps, respondent
services, and other visual guides.
Best-practice organizational structures, processes and appeals mechanisms within higher education and within private industry that are designed to respond
to the issues under review to include a review of the current work group, policy group
and communications group.
Resources identified that are lacking or necessary to improve in this effort.
Scope
The comprehensive review will examine all aspects of the institution’s efforts to
effectively implement Title IX efforts to include: education, communications, reporting,
investigation, adjudication, advocacy, support and care. The comprehensive review
will have access to all information and resources that the task force would like to
examine. In addition, and if necessary or requested, the task force will secure outside
support or expertise to inform their analysis and recommendations.
Outcome
The final product of the review will be recommendations for improving processes, procedures,
communication and education; a draft timeline for improvement implementation; initial
budgeting needed to implement the recommendations; and other actions necessary to
improve university systems.
Timeline
The team will have an initial period of 45-days to conduct its review. Of note, however,
is the ability of the president to extend the work of the team beyond this initial
time period should conditions warrant.
The Title IX Task Force
The Title IX Task Force is comprised of two key components and enabled by the entire
university:
Co-leadership representing both faculty and staff.
Inclusive task force membership representing a broad cohort of faculty, staff and
students.
Co-Leaders:
Kirsten Kennedy, associate vice president, Student Housing and Sustainability, Division of Student
Affairs and Academic Support

Our People
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX is on a mission to create an environment where
all people are treated with dignity and respect and have an equal opportunity to learn
and work at a university free from discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct.
Report an Incident
If you or someone you know has been the victim/survivor of discrimination or harassment
at the University of South Carolina, you can report it. Please know this does not
automatically initiate an investigation or notify the alleged person, but can connect
those impacted with staff to discuss options.
Our Location
Our office is located on the fourth floor of the James F. Byrnes building inside suite
401.
The main message I want people to get is ‘We want you to be treated well by us and
by one another, regardless of what your identity is.’
