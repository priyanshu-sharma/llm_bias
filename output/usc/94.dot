For questions that are not answered by the information\non this webpage, students are encouraged to contact the Office of Civil Rights and\nTitle IX.\nThe University of South Carolina recognizes that a welcoming, supportive environment\nis essential for students to succeed, thrive, and realize their full potential. It\nis the desire and intent of the University to foster and maintain a welcoming environment\nfor all its students, including pregnant and parenting students who are faced with\nchallenges in addition to those that come with being a student.\nExpand all1. Federal law prohibits sex discrimination (which includes discrimination based on\npregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions).\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits sex discrimination\nin any educational program or activity that receives federal funds. This includes\nthe University of South Carolina. Title IX is found in the United States Code at Title\n20, Section 1681 and states:\nProhibition Against Discrimination\nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation\nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...\nTitle IX also prohibits discrimination against pregnant or parenting students participating\nin such programs or activities. Specifically, Part 106.40 of Title 34 of the Code\nof Federal Regulations, states:\nMarital or Parental Status\nA recipient [of federal funds, such as the University of South Carolina] shall not\napply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital\nstatus which treats students differently on the basis of sex.\nThe regulations make clear that there are certain actions colleges and universities\nreceiving federal funds cannot take, and that there are certain actions that colleges\nand universities are required to take:\nThe University of South Carolina cannot discriminate against any student because of\nthe student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or\nrecovery from any of these conditions.\nThe University of South Carolina cannot exclude any student from its education programs\nor activities because of the student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination\nof pregnancy or recovery from any of these conditions, unless the student requests\nvoluntarily to participate in a separate or special portion of any program or activity.\nThe University of South Carolina cannot require a doctor to certify a pregnant student\nis physically and emotionally able to continue participation in a program or activity,\nunless such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional\nconditions requiring the attention of a doctor. This means the university cannot treat\npregnant students differently from other students being treated by doctors, even when\npregnant students are in the later stages of pregnancy.\nEven though colleges and universities should not presume pregnant students are unable\nto attend school or participate in school activities, this does not mean that a college\nor university that receives federal funds may not be required to provide accommodations\nfor pregnant students to allow them to attend school.\nTo ensure a pregnant student\xe2\x80\x99s access to its educational programs or activities, when\nnecessary, a school must make adjustments to its regular programs that are reasonable\nand responsive to the student\xe2\x80\x99s temporary pregnancy status. For example, a school\nmay be required to provide a larger desk, allow frequent or longer bathroom breaks,\nor make other reasonable accommodations.\nA college or university that receives federal funds must treat pregnancy, childbirth,\nfalse pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from any of these conditions\nthe same as it treats any other temporary disability regarding any medical or hospital\nbenefit, service, plan or policy which the college or university offers or operates\nfor students admitted to its educational program or activity.\nThe University of South Carolina must treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy,\ntermination of pregnancy and recovery from any of these conditions as an excused absence\nfor the period of time deemed medically necessary by the student's physician. At the\nconclusion of that period of absence, the university must reinstate the student to\nthe status which she held when the leave began.\nThis \xe2\x80\x9creinstatement\xe2\x80\x9d should include giving the student the opportunity to make up\nany work that was missed. The university may offer the student alternatives to making\nup missed work. This may involve allowing the student to repeat or retake a course\nor allowing the student additional time in a program to continue at the same pace\nand finish at a later date, especially after longer periods of leave. This should\ninvolve an interactive process between the student and the instructor.\nHowever, in considering requests for accommodations, the university is not required\nto grant an accommodation that would fundamentally alter any university program or\nactivity, or that would constitute an undue financial or administrative burden on\nthe university.\nIn addition to the above requirements of Title IX, harassing a student because of\npregnancy may violate Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against sex discrimination. Harassing\nconduct can take many forms, including verbal (oral) as well as graphic and physical\nacts.\nClick here to access the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights webpage\nwhich includes the pamphlet titled: Supporting the Academic Success of Pregnant and Parenting Students, which includes information on Title IX protections afforded pregnant and parenting\nstudents.\n2. University policy prohibits sex discrimination (which includes discrimination based\non pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions).\nCR Policy 1.00 provides:\nDiscrimination or harassment based on age, ancestry, citizenship status, color, disability,\nethnicity, familial status, gender (including transgender), gender identity or expression,\ngenetic information, HIV/AIDs status, military status, national origin, pregnancy\n(false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, childbirth, recovery therefrom or related\nmedical conditions, breastfeeding), race, religion (including religious dress and\ngrooming practices), sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other bases under\nfederal, state, local law, or regulations is prohibited.\nSee the full text of CR 1.00 here. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Additionally, CR 1.00 prohibits retaliation against anyone who files a complaint of\nunlawful discrimination or harassment.\n3. University of South Carolina Lactation Support Policy\nThe University of South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Lactation Support Policy applies to employees and\nstudents.HR Policy 1.60 (Lactation Support Policy) states:\nThe university shall provide sanitary and private space to be used as a lactation\nroom by employees or students who are breastfeeding and/or expressing milk; and supervisors,\nchairs and managers are required to work with employees and students who are breastfeeding to schedule reasonable and adjustable break times each day\nfor this activity.\nClick here for the current list of lactation rooms/nursing mothers' lounges on the Columbia\nCampus.\nYou may review the entire Lactation Support Policy by clicking here.\nInformation about additional services provided by Students Health Services for new\nand expecting parents is available at this link.\n4. Additional Information and Resources\nOffice of Civil Rights and Title IX\nFor assistance with academic supportive measures, contact the Office of Civil Rights\n& Title IX by either calling/emailing the office or filling out a report.\nStudent Disability Resource Center\nPregnancy, in and of itself, is not a disability.
