Resources for Pregnant and Parenting Students
This webpage is provided to offer information to pregnant and parenting students at
the University of South Carolina. For questions that are not answered by the information
on this webpage, students are encouraged to contact the Office of Civil Rights and
Title IX.
The University of South Carolina recognizes that a welcoming, supportive environment
is essential for students to succeed, thrive, and realize their full potential. It
is the desire and intent of the University to foster and maintain a welcoming environment
for all its students, including pregnant and parenting students who are faced with
challenges in addition to those that come with being a student.
Expand all1. Federal law prohibits sex discrimination (which includes discrimination based on
pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions).
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits sex discrimination
in any educational program or activity that receives federal funds. This includes
the University of South Carolina. Title IX is found in the United States Code at Title
20, Section 1681 and states:
Prohibition Against Discrimination
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...
Title IX also prohibits discrimination against pregnant or parenting students participating
in such programs or activities. Specifically, Part 106.40 of Title 34 of the Code
of Federal Regulations, states:
Marital or Parental Status
A recipient [of federal funds, such as the University of South Carolina] shall not
apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital
status which treats students differently on the basis of sex.
The regulations make clear that there are certain actions colleges and universities
receiving federal funds cannot take, and that there are certain actions that colleges
and universities are required to take:
The University of South Carolina cannot discriminate against any student because of
the student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or
recovery from any of these conditions.
The University of South Carolina cannot exclude any student from its education programs
or activities because of the student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination
of pregnancy or recovery from any of these conditions, unless the student requests
voluntarily to participate in a separate or special portion of any program or activity.
The University of South Carolina cannot require a doctor to certify a pregnant student
is physically and emotionally able to continue participation in a program or activity,
unless such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional
conditions requiring the attention of a doctor. This means the university cannot treat
pregnant students differently from other students being treated by doctors, even when
pregnant students are in the later stages of pregnancy.
Even though colleges and universities should not presume pregnant students are unable
to attend school or participate in school activities, this does not mean that a college
or university that receives federal funds may not be required to provide accommodations
for pregnant students to allow them to attend school.
To ensure a pregnant student’s access to its educational programs or activities, when
necessary, a school must make adjustments to its regular programs that are reasonable
and responsive to the student’s temporary pregnancy status. For example, a school
may be required to provide a larger desk, allow frequent or longer bathroom breaks,
or make other reasonable accommodations.
A college or university that receives federal funds must treat pregnancy, childbirth,
false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from any of these conditions
the same as it treats any other temporary disability regarding any medical or hospital
benefit, service, plan or policy which the college or university offers or operates
for students admitted to its educational program or activity.
The University of South Carolina must treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy,
termination of pregnancy and recovery from any of these conditions as an excused absence
for the period of time deemed medically necessary by the student's physician. At the
conclusion of that period of absence, the university must reinstate the student to
the status which she held when the leave began.
This “reinstatement” should include giving the student the opportunity to make up
any work that was missed. The university may offer the student alternatives to making
up missed work. This may involve allowing the student to repeat or retake a course
or allowing the student additional time in a program to continue at the same pace
and finish at a later date, especially after longer periods of leave. This should
involve an interactive process between the student and the instructor.
However, in considering requests for accommodations, the university is not required
to grant an accommodation that would fundamentally alter any university program or
activity, or that would constitute an undue financial or administrative burden on
the university.
In addition to the above requirements of Title IX, harassing a student because of
pregnancy may violate Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination. Harassing
conduct can take many forms, including verbal (oral) as well as graphic and physical
acts.
Click here to access the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights webpage
which includes the pamphlet titled: Supporting the Academic Success of Pregnant and Parenting Students, which includes information on Title IX protections afforded pregnant and parenting
students.
2. University policy prohibits sex discrimination (which includes discrimination based
on pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions).
CR Policy 1.00 provides:
Discrimination or harassment based on age, ancestry, citizenship status, color, disability,
ethnicity, familial status, gender (including transgender), gender identity or expression,
genetic information, HIV/AIDs status, military status, national origin, pregnancy
(false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, childbirth, recovery therefrom or related
medical conditions, breastfeeding), race, religion (including religious dress and
grooming practices), sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other bases under
federal, state, local law, or regulations is prohibited.
See the full text of CR 1.00 here.   Additionally, CR 1.00 prohibits retaliation against anyone who files a complaint of
unlawful discrimination or harassment.
3. University of South Carolina Lactation Support Policy
The University of South Carolina’s Lactation Support Policy applies to employees and
students.HR Policy 1.60 (Lactation Support Policy) states:
The university shall provide sanitary and private space to be used as a lactation
room by employees or students who are breastfeeding and/or expressing milk; and supervisors,
chairs and managers are required to work with employees and students who are breastfeeding to schedule reasonable and adjustable break times each day
for this activity.

My professors at South Carolina Law have equipped me with a rich insight into our
legal system while also helping me grow as a professional in the way I write, present,
and interact with my future colleagues. I am not the same person I was three years
ago; I feel confident and excited to serve my community with the knowledge and skills
I’ve gained.

Our People
The Office of Civil Rights & Title IX is on a mission to create an environment where
all people are treated with dignity and respect and have an equal opportunity to learn
and work at a university free from discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct.
Report an Incident
If you or someone you know has been the victim/survivor of discrimination or harassment
at the University of South Carolina, you can report it. Please know this does not
automatically initiate an investigation or notify the alleged person, but can connect
those impacted with staff to discuss options.
Our Location
Our office is located on the fourth floor of the James F. Byrnes building inside suite
401.
The main message I want people to get is ‘We want you to be treated well by us and
by one another, regardless of what your identity is.’
Molly Peirano, Assistant Vice President for Civil Rights and Title IX/Title IX & ADA
Coordinator
