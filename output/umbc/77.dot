In addition, nearly all students, faculty, and staff have completed the mandatory online and/or in-person training related to sexual misconduct. The Office of Equity and Civil Rights will continue to develop and deliver regular mandatory training on discrimination and sexual misconduct to all students, faculty, and staff.\nWhile we recognize that achieving inclusion is an ongoing process, we will continue to strive to make our campus a safe and welcoming atmosphere for everyone.\nFile a Report/ Make a Referral to ECR\nThis form is used to confidentially report incidents under the UMBC Sexual Misconduct (Title IX) Policy, and Anti-Discrimination Policy which apply to all UMBC students, student employees, faculty, staff, interns, contractors, volunteers, guests and visitors.\nDo not use this form to report an immediate threat.If you or someone you know is in danger, immediately call UMBC Police at (410) 455-5555 or call 911.\nECR Contact Info:\necr@umbc.edu /\xc2\xa0410-455-1717\nFor Emergencies:\xc2\xa0 Contact your local police via 911;\xc2\xa0UMBC Police\xc2\xa0at 410-455-5555; or,\xc2\xa0in the event you do not feel you are able to contact law enforcement,\xc2\xa0Maryland 2-1-1\nAfter-Hours Support Line (through Retriever Integrated Health): 410-455-3230\nUMBC and ECR are committed to creating an accessible and inclusive environment; including our website; for all students, employees, and visitors.\xc2\xa0 If you have difficulties accessing any of the materials on this site, please let us know so that we can provide an alternative format and remedy any accessibility challenges.\xc2\xa0 Please contact us at ecr@umbc.edu or call 410-455-1717.\nThe Pride Center for LGBTQIA2+ Diversity\nAugust 30, 2023\ni3b Open Houses: The Pride Center for LGBTQIA2+ Diversity  Welcome Week Open Houses  Wednesday, August 30, 2023\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb7 1 - 4 PM  University Center : 201D      Pop into The Pride Center and meet our new...\nPosted: August 1, 2023, 1:01 PM\nThe Mosaic Center Open House August 30\nRepost\ni3b Open House - The Mosaic: Center for Cultural Diversity  Welcome Open House  Wednesday, August 30, 2023\xc2\xa01 - 4 PM  The Commons : 2B23     Looking for a space where you can study with friends,...\nPosted: July 31, 2023, 1:32 PM\nPRIDE Week\nApril 24 - 29, 2023\nIMPORTANT   PRIDE Week 2023 Details & Pride Center Hours  Check out the final updates for our event line-up!

What is Covered by this Policy:\xc2\xa0 Jurisdiction\nThe University has jurisdiction over all reports of Prohibited Conduct under this Policy, in connection with University educational programs and activities.\nEducation Program or Activity includes: all University operations, as well as locations, events, or circumstances over which the University exercises substantial control over both the person who engages in Prohibited Conduct and the context in which the Prohibited conduct occurs.\nThis includes, but is not limited to:\nUniversity premises, or at facility, office, regional center education program or activity, or property owned and controlled by the University;\nAny on or off-campus UMBC sponsored, recognized, or approved employment or educational program or activity, in the United States; or\nAny building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution, whether such a building is on campus or off campus.\nThe University also reserves the discretion to address any Prohibited Conduct, on or off-campus, that threatens the health or safety of the UMBC Community or a member of the UMBC community under this Policy, or the UMBC Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy or the UMBC Code of Student Conduct.\nIII. Effective Date\nThe effective date of these Procedures is August 14, 2020.\nFor Prohibited Conduct that occurred prior to August 14, 2020, and was reported prior to August 14, 2020, the definitions, policies and procedures in existence prior to August 14, 2020 will be used through conclusion of the matter, including any appeal, and enforcement of any sanctions.\nFor Prohibited Conduct that occurred prior to August 14, 2020, but is reported on or after August 14, 2020, the definitions of Prohibited Conduct in the former policy will apply, but the procedures referenced in this new policy will be used to investigate and resolve any formal complaints through conclusion of the matter, including any appeal, and enforcement of any sanctions.\nWhere Prohibited Conduct occurs on or after August 14, 2020, the new definitions, policies and procedures will apply, except when the Prohibited Conduct is sufficiently related to and arises out of a matter already under review as of August 14, 2020, but not yet completed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cReported\xe2\x80\x9d under this provision, means information reported to ECR, the Title IX Coordinator, a quasi-confidential source or a Responsible Employer.\nIV.\xc2\xa0 Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy and the applicable Procedures, the following definitions apply.\nActual Knowledge means notice of Prohibited Conduct or allegations of Sexual Harassment to the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator or any official of the University who has authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the institution.\nAdministrative leave is placement of any employee on leave pending resolution of an investigation, resolution or hearing process.\nAdvisor means a person who may, but is not required to be an attorney, who is chosen by a Party or appointed by the institution to conduct cross-examination for the party at a Formal Hearing.\nAmnesty means that an individual who makes a report of Prohibited Conduct to the University or law enforcement, or participates as a witness in good faith, will not be subject to disciplinary action for their own personal consumption of alcohol or drugs taken/used at or near the time of the incident of Prohibited Conduct, provided that any such violation was not an act that was reasonably likely to place the health or safety of any other person at risk.\nComplainant is an individual who is alleged to be the victim or subject of Prohibited Conduct.\nConditions are non-disciplinary actions which may include requirements, educational, remedial or Supportive/Interim Measures that may be imposed by the University upon any party who is subject to this Policy. \xc2\xa0 The University may impose Conditions even where no formal complaint has been filed, and no finding of a violation has been made. Conditions are not disciplinary actions or sanctions.\nConfidential Resource means means an employee who is not a mandatory reporter or Responsible employee with respect to reports of sexual assault, sexual harassment and/or retaliation (irrespective of Clery Act Campus Security Authority status).\nCommunity Members may report Prohibited Conduct to a Confidential Resource, and that Confidential Resources does not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator or Office of Equity and Civil Rights.\nConversations with Confidential Resources will remain confidential, except, when there is an imminent or continuing threat to health or safety (as determined in the sole discretion of the University), where there is a disclosure of apparent or suspected abuse of a child or dependent adult, or other legal obligation to reveal such information.\nConsent is defined as a knowing, voluntary, and affirmatively communicated willingness to mutually participate in a particular sexual activity or behavior. It must be given by a person with the ability and capacity to exercise free will and make a rational and reasonable judgment without Incapacity, Coercion, Force or threat of Force.\nConsent may be expressed either by affirmative words or actions, as long as those words or actions create a mutually understandable permission regarding the conditions of sexual activity or behavior. Under this definition, consent must be given at each stage of the sexual activity or behavior and can never be assumed.\nConsent to one form of sexual activity or behavior does not automatically imply consent to engage in other forms of sexual activity or behavior. Consent to one sexual act does not constitute or imply consent to another act.\nFor purposes of this Policy, consent is not inferred or assumed from silence, passivity or a lack of objection or resistance. Consent cannot be obtained by force, threat, coercion, fraud, manipulation, reasonable fear of injury, intimidation, or through the use of one\xe2\x80\x99s mental or physical helplessness or incapacity. The absence of a negative response, such as silence or a failure to physically resist does not equal consent.\nConsent cannot be obtained by Sexual Coercion.\xc2\xa0 Sexual Coercion is the use of unreasonable pressure in an effort to compel another individual to initiate or continue sexual activity against the individual\xe2\x80\x99s will. A person\xe2\x80\x99s words or conduct are sufficient to constitute coercion if they wrongfully impair another individuals\xe2\x80\x99 freedom of will and ability to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity. Coercion includes but is not limited to intimidation, manipulation, threats of emotional or physical harm, and blackmail. Examples of coercion include threatening to disclose another individuals\xe2\x80\x99 private sexual information, or threatening to harm oneself if the other party does not engage in the sexual activity.\nSome behaviors and comments that do not indicate consent include (but are not limited to): Silence; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe;\xe2\x80\x9d A head shake; Lack of objection; Not fighting back; Ambiguous responses such as \xe2\x80\x9cuh huh\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmm hmm\xe2\x80\x9d without more; and A verbal \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d even if it may sound indecisive or insincere.\nIt is the responsibility of the person initiating sexual activity or behavior to make sure that they have received consent at each of those stages from all person(s) engaged in the sexual activity or behavior. If a person is not sure they have received consent or has received an unclear response, they have an obligation to seek additional information to make sure that they have received consent. Failure to do so could violate this Policy and lead to disciplinary action or sanctions. Consent cannot be based on assumptions.\nConsent must be present throughout the entire sexual activity or behavior and may be withdrawn at any time. Once consent is withdrawn, the sexual activity or behavior must cease immediately. If there is confusion as to whether there is consent or whether prior consent has been withdrawn, it is essential that the sexual activity or behavior cease until the confusion is resolved.\nConsent cannot be implied based upon a previous or existing consensual dating or sexual relationship. In the context of a current relationship, consent for future sexual activity or behavior cannot be implied.\nAlcohol and Drugs may complicate sexual activity as they impair judgment, affect ability to read and interpret others\xe2\x80\x99 communication, and affect a person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to communicate consent.\nThe use of alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicating substances does not excuse the person initiating sexual activity from making sure that they have obtained consent before initiating and/or engaging in sexual activity or behavior.\nA person can give consent even if they have been drinking or using other drugs. Where alcohol and/or drugs were involved, the University will examine whether or not the person initiating sexual activity or behavior knew or a sober and reasonable person in the same situation should have known whether the other person was capable of giving consent or gave consent.\nDating Violence means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\nDays means business days.\xc2\xa0 Days when the University is closed for inclement weather, emergency closure, and/or officially designated holidays (observed), shall not be counted.\nDiscrimination on the Basis of Sex is defined as disparate treatment of a UMBC community member based on their sex, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, that unreasonably interferes with or limit a community member\xe2\x80\x99s access to employment or conditions and benefits of employment; ability to participate in, access, or benefit from educational programs, services, or activities; or ability to participate in, access, or benefit from the University\xe2\x80\x99s extracurricular programs. Complaints of Discrimination on the Basis of Sex are not resolved under the Title IX Hearing Process.\nDomestic Violence includes conduct which could be felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the Complainant, by a person with whom the Complainant shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the Complainant as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the Complainant, or by any other person against an adult or youth Complainant protected from those acts by domestic or family violence laws of Maryland.\nEducation Program or Activity includes all incidents occurring on campus or in University Operations as well as locations, events, or circumstances over which the University exercised substantial control over both the person who engaged in Prohibited Conduct and and the context in which the Prohibited Conduct occurs, and any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the University. Conduct by or impacting employees is covered.\nEmergency Removal the decision to remove a student, staff or faculty member or third-party from the University\xe2\x80\x99s campus, or education program or activity on an emergency basis, after an individualized safety and risk analysis, determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student, staff or faculty member or third-party arising from the allegations of sexual harassment justifies removal.\nForce is the use of overt physical force or strength or other modes of coercion to compel participation in sexual activity without consent. Force includes but is not limited to physical violence, physical imposition, actual or implied threats, intimidation, and coercion that is intended to overcome resistance or refusal to participate in sexual activity.\nFormal Complaint means a document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging Prohibited Conduct and requesting that the institution investigate the allegation. At the time of filing a Formal Complaint, a Complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in the Education Program or Activity of the University.\nIncapacitation is a state in which a person\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making ability is impaired such that the person lacks the ability to understand the \xe2\x80\x9cwho, what, where, why, or how\xe2\x80\x9d of their sexual activity or behavior.\nIncapacity is a state in which someone cannot make a decision because they lack the ability to fully understand what is happening and therefore cannot consent even if they appear to be a willing participant.\nIncapacitation may result from a number of causes. A person can be incapacitated through the use of drugs, alcohol or any other intoxicating substance, or when they are unconscious, asleep or otherwise unaware the sexual activity or behavior is occurring. Further, mental or physical disabilities or cognitive impairments can cause an individual to lack the capacity to consent to sexual activity or behavior. Incapacitation may also occur when a person is physically restrained against their will, so the person is physically unable to resist or consent to sexual activity or behavior.\nIncapacitation due to alcohol and/or drugs is a state beyond intoxication, impair in judgment, or \xe2\x80\x9cdrunkenness.\xe2\x80\x9d Because the impact of alcohol and/or drug use varies from person to person, when evaluating whether an individual (Complainant) is/was Incapacitated, and therefore unable to give Consent, the University will assess relevant factors, which may include but are not limited to:\nloss of control over physical movements such as lack of coordination or inability to walk unassisted\nslurred or disorganized speech and other indications of inability to communicate\nloss of inhibitions\nincreased risk taking\noutrageous or unusual behavior\nintermittent or complete loss of consciousness\nother observed changes to a persons physical presentation and demeanor reflective of an altered state.\nFactors indicating that a person is/was consuming alcohol may also be considered. These include but are not limited to:\nwitness observations related to the amount of alcohol consumed\nvomiting\nblood shot eyes\nthe smell of alcohol on the breath. Further, for the purposes of determining Consent, the University will consider whether the Responding Party \xe2\x80\x9cknew\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cshould have known\xe2\x80\x9d that the Complainant was Incapacitated. The University will make this determination by assessing whether, based on the totality of the circumstances and context, a sober, reasonable person in the same situation (as the Respondent) \xe2\x80\x9cknew\xe2\x80\x9d and/or \xe2\x80\x9cshould have known\xe2\x80\x9d that the Complainant was Incapacitated.\nInformal Resolution Process is a process that can be used to address Prohibited Conduct instead of a Title IX Hearing or Review Meeting.\xc2\xa0 An Informal or Alternative Resolution Process cannot be used for Sexual Assault or for Sexual Harassment of a student by an employee.\xc2\xa0 Informal Resolution may\xc2\xa0 may be used for Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Sexual Exploitation and Hostile Environment Harassment if: (1) a formal complaint has been filed, (2) notice has been given to the parties; and (3) all/both parties agree.\xc2\xa0 During the Informal Resolution Process, no formal investigation will take place, and no formal report of findings will be issued.\nProhibited Conduct under this Policy includes Discrimination, Sexual Harassment (including Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Stalking and Retaliation), Sexual Exploitation and Retaliation.\nUMBC also prohibits Discrimination on the basis of sex, Sexual Harassment II, Sexual Exploitation, and Retaliation.

If sexual activity or behavior does occur, such conduct may also constitute Sexual Assault; Indecent Exposure which is exposing one\xe2\x80\x99s intimate parts, such as genitalia, groin, breast and/or buttocks to someone without their consent. This behavior is the deliberate showing of intimate parts of the body and may, but does not necessarily have to, include a sexual act. Engaging in sexual activity in public, witnessed by non-consenting person(s), is also a form of Indecent Exposure.\nSexual Misconduct includes Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Harassment II, and Retaliation.\nSexual Misconduct Complaints are not resolved under the Title IX Hearing Process.\nSexual Harassment I means conduct in the United States, in an Education Program or Activity, on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:\nAn employee conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; or\nUnwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the Education Program or Activity; or\nSexual Assault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, or Stalking.\nSexual Harassment II.\xc2\xa0 Sexual Harassment II is defined as any unwelcome sexual advance, unwelcome request for sexual favors, unwelcome verbal, physical, electronic or other conduct of a sexual nature, that targets a UMBC community member because of their gender, when such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s work or academic performance, i.e., it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a working, academic, residential, or social environment, that a reasonable person in similar circumstances would find intimidating, hostile, humiliating, demeaning, or sexually offensive.\nSexual Harassment II is also defined as harassment for exhibiting what is perceived as a stereotypical characteristic for one\xe2\x80\x99s sex or gender or for failing to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity, regardless of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s actual or perceived sex, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.\xc2\xa0 An isolated incident, unless sufficiently severe or pervasive, generally does not amount to Sexual Harassment II.\xc2\xa0 However, a single incident, if sufficiently severe, may constitute Sexual Harassment II. Sexual Harassment II Complaints are not resolved under the Title IX Hearing Process.\nFor Matters involving Employee Complainants and Respondents Only: Harassment Includes:\nUnwelcome and offensive conduct, which need not be severe or pervasive when:\nThe conduct is based on race, color, religion, ancestry, or national origin, sex, age, martial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability; and\nSubmission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment of an individual;\nSubmission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, the conduct unreasonably creates a working environment that a reasonable person would perceive to be abusive or hostile; and\nSexual Harassment, which includes conduct which need not be severe or pervasive, that consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal, or physical contact or conduct of a sexual nature when:\nSubmission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment of an individual;\nSubmission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, the conduct unreasonably creates a working environment that a reasonable person would perceive to be abusive or hostile; and/or\nThe conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s work performance or creating an intimidating or offensive working environment that is perceived by the affected individual to be abusive or hostile.\nStalking means engaging in a course of conduct on the basis of sex, which is directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress.\nSupportive/Interim Measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the parties before or after the filing of a Formal Complaint or where no Formal Complaint has been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the Education Program or Activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of the parties, the safety of the community or the institution\xe2\x80\x99s educational environment, deter Sexual Harassment or to ensure the integrity of the investigative and/or adjudicative processes.\nTitle IX Hearing Process means a method of formal adjudication process designated by UMBC to address Complaints of Sexual Harassment I which complies with the requirements of the Title IX regulations, at 34 CFR \xc2\xa7106.45.\nV. University Response to Prohibited Conduct\nA.\xc2\xa0 Response\nOnce the University has Actual Knowledge of Prohibited Conduct in its Education Program or Activity against a person in the United States must respond promptly in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent. A response is \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately indifferent\xe2\x80\x9d if it is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\nActual Knowledge\nActual Knowledge is receipt of notice of allegations of Prohibited Conduct to the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator, Office of Equity and Civil Rights, or an official of the recipient who has authority to institute corrective measures; constructive notice is insufficient to constitute actual knowledge.\nPublic Disclosures and Research-Based Disclosures are Not Actual Knowledge\nDisclosures in the following categories shall not be considered notice to the University of Prohibited Conduct for the purpose of triggering its obligation to address and/or investigate any particular incident(s):\nPublic Disclosures, including disclosures include disclosures of incidents of alleged Sexual Misconduct during or in connection with public awareness events such as \xe2\x80\x9cTake Back the Night,\xe2\x80\x9d candlelight vigils, protests, \xe2\x80\x9csurvivor speak-outs,\xe2\x80\x9d or other forums. Although such disclosures do not constitute notice to the University of Sexual Misconduct for purposes of triggering its obligation to investigate any particular incident(s), such disclosures may inform the need for campus-wide education and prevention efforts, and the University will provide information at these events about UMBC community members\xe2\x80\x99 Title IX rights and about available University and community resources and support services.\nCertain Research-Based Disclosures, including disclosures include disclosures of incidents of alleged Sexual Misconduct made by a University student during such student\xe2\x80\x99s participation as a subject in an Institutional Review Board-approved human subject\xe2\x80\x99s research protocol. Institutional Review Boards may, however, in appropriate cases, require researchers to provide information to all subjects of a study about their Title IX rights and about available University and community resources and support services.\nB. Compliance\nTitle IX Coordinator\nUMBC has designated and authorized its Title IX Coordinator who is responsible for coordinating\xc2\xa0 its efforts to comply with Title IX and this Policy, and that employee must be referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX Coordinator.\xe2\x80\x9d The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the effective implementation of remedies, including Supportive/Interim Measures.\nOffice of Equity and Civil Rights (ECR)\nThe Title IX Coordinator is part of the University\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Equity and Civil Rights, which is responsible for addressing a broad range of civil rights issues including but not limited to Title IX.\xc2\xa0 Members of ECR work with the Title IX Coordinator to assure prompt, equitable response to reported concerns.\xc2\xa0 The Title IX Coordinator and ECR designees also work closely with representatives from the University Police Department, Student Affairs, the Provost\xe2\x80\x99s Office, and Human Resources, and other departments/ offices, as well as third-party contractors or affiliates, as necessary to fulfill the University\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under this Policy.\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall be responsible for coordinating the activities when a collaborative response is necessary.\nC. Notice of Nondiscrimination Policy\nDistribution\nThe University will publish a notice of nondiscrimination which will be widely distributed to all students, employees, applicants for admission and employment, and other relevant persons (including all unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the institution).The notice will be prominently displayed on the institution\xe2\x80\x99s website and included in publications of general distribution that provide information to students and employees about the University\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0 services and USM Bylaws, Policies and Procedures of the Board of Regents policies, including each handbook or catalog that it makes available to persons entitled to a notification.\nContents\nThe Notice will:\nConfirm that the University does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the Education Program or Activity that it operates, that the University is required by Title IX not to discriminate in such a manner, and that obligation extends to admission and employment;\nProvide that matters covered by Title IX should be referred to the Title IX Coordinator or to the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education, or both.\nVI. Preservation of Evidence of Prohibited Conduct\nPreserving evidence is important and may be necessary to prove criminal conduct or obtain an order of protection.\nYou should take steps to preserve physical evidence by refraining from showering, bathing, eating or drinking, brushing teeth or gargling, changing clothes, urinating or defecating, brushing or combing hair, or smoking.\xc2\xa0 Clothing worn at the time of the incident should not be washed and should be placed in a paper bag \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d and taken to the hospital.\nYou should also preserve other kinds of evidence such as text messages, records of phone calls, email messages, social media posts, photos, notes, gifts, and electronic payment records for car services like Uber and Lyft as they may all be relevant evidence.\nVII. \xc2\xa0 Where to Obtain a Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE)\nIf you are in danger or need immediate medical care \xe2\x80\x93 CALL 911.\xc2\xa0 If possible, quickly get to a safe place.\nYou can go to any emergency room to get a SAFE, or you can go to a Hospital with a SAFE program.\nA SAFE allows for the collection of evidence, documenting injuries, and can ensure physical evidence is preserved in the event of a report to law enforcement. A SAFE should occur within 120 hours (5 days) after the incident.\nCompleting a SAFE does not require that you contact the police, and does not require that you report the assault to the University.\nIf needed, free transportation to obtain a SAFE can be arranged through contacting the Title IX Coordinator at 410.455.1250 during normal business hours, University Health Services at 410.455.2542, or the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Center at 410.455.2714.

Right to Report to Law Enforcement\nVictims of Sexual Assault have the right to file criminal charges with the appropriate law enforcement officials, which may include the UMBC Police, or local law enforcement officers the state, city or county where the Prohibited Conduct occurs.\nThe University will assist members of the community who wish to report Prohibited Conduct to law enforcement authorities, including University Police, Title IX Coordinator, Representatives of the Office of Equity and Civil Rights, Women\xe2\x80\x99s Center, and Student Conduct are available to assist students, faculty, and staff in reporting to law enforcement.\nComplainants also have the right to decide not to notify or contact law enforcement.\nIf the UMBC Police receive a report that includes information regarding Prohibited Conduct that may constitute a crime, University Police will advise the person reporting that in addition to making a criminal report, they also have the right to make a report with the University and engage the University\xe2\x80\x99s informal and/or formal processes under this Policy and applicable Procedures.\nIn addition, as Responsible Employees under this Policy, University Police who receive any type of report of Prohibited Conduct, whether it rises to the level of a crime or not, shall promptly notify the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator.\nB. Reporting to the University\nThe University has a variety of welcoming and accessible ways for UMBC community members to raise concerns and report instances of Prohibited Conduct.\nAmnesty while Reporting\nAn individual who makes a report of Prohibited Conduct to the University or law enforcement, or participates as a witness in good faith, will not be subject to disciplinary action for their own personal consumption of alcohol or drugs taken/used at or near the time of the incident of Prohibited Conduct, provided that any such violation was not an act that was reasonably likely to place the health or safety of any other person at risk. The University may, however, initiate an educational discussion or pursue other interventions/ assessments for substance abuse. Amnesty will not be extended for any violations of University policy other than alcohol/drug use. In addition, Amnesty does not preclude or prevent action by police or other legal authorities. In addition, the use of alcohol, drugs, and/or legally prescribed medication does not justify or excuse behavior that constitutes Prohibited Conduct under this Policy.\nWho may Report\nAny person may report Prohibited Conduct (whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of conduct).\nHow to Report\nMembers of the community are encouraged to report directly to the Title IX Coordinator and/or Office of Equity and Civil Rights. Reports may be made in person, by mail, by telephone, by electronic mail, or online to the Office of Equity and Civil Rights or the Title IX Coordinator. Reports may also be made verbally to the Title IX Coordinator. Reports may be made at any time (including during non-business hours) by using the telephone number or e-mail address, mail or online.\nWhat Happens after you Report\nReporting does not require that a person file a formal complaint, or request that the University take any action or investigate the conduct. Persons reporting to the Title IX Coordinator and/or ECR are entitled to Supportive/Interim Measures, whether or not they chose to file a Formal Complaint. The University recognizes that the decision whether or not to make a report of Prohibited Conduct is personal, and that there are many factors that may impact someone\xe2\x80\x99s decision to report, both individual and societal, to reporting. If a person who reports wants to file a Formal Complaint they must agree to have the University provide the Respondent with a Notice of Complaint.\xc2\xa0 The University may not proceed with a Formal Complaint without issuing a Notice of Investigation to the Respondent.\nAnonymous Reporting\nYou may also report conduct Anonymously. Anonymous reports of Prohibited Conduct can be made with the University without disclosing one\xe2\x80\x99s name and without identifying the Responding Party or requesting any action in writing, or via the online reporting form. Based upon the amount of information provided about the incident and the UMBC community members involved, the University\xe2\x80\x99s response to an anonymous report may be limited.\nRequest by Complainant for No University Action/ University Complaint\nSupportive/interim measures are available with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint.\nWhen Prohibited Conduct is reported, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly contact the Complainant or reporting party to discuss the availability of Supportive/Interim Measures and explain the process for filing a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator will consider the complainant\xe2\x80\x99s preferences and stated needs with respect to both Supportive/Interim Measures and any decision regarding a formal complaint. A person reporting Prohibited Conduct may request that their identity not be disclosed to anyone else.\nA person may also disclose the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s identity, but ask that the University not investigate, issue a Notice of Investigation or take any action.\nEven where the person reporting does not seek any action, the Title IX Coordinator may prepare and sign a Formal Complaint if they determine, in their sole discretion, that the University wants to move forward, when doing so is not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, for example, where there appears to be a continuing threat to an individual or the UMBC community.\nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines that the University has an obligation to move forward, the University shall communicate with the person who reported the conduct and explain the reasons why the University must proceed, and offer Supportive Measures. In determining whether to file a Formal Complaint on behalf of the University, (a \xe2\x80\x9cUniversity Complaint\xe2\x80\x9d), the Title IX Coordinator will consider the totality of the circumstances, by considering factors, including but not limited to:\nThe complainant\xe2\x80\x99s wishes regarding how the University should respond to the allegations.\nThe nature and scope of the alleged Prohibited Conduct, including, but not limited to, whether the reported Prohibited Conduct involved the use of a weapon or force;\nThe risk posed to any individual or to the members of the UMBC community by not proceeding, including the risk of violence;\nA pattern of alleged Prohibited Conduct by a particular Respondent or Group, or at a particular location;\nWhether the University possesses other means to obtain relevant evidence;\nConsiderations of fundamental fairness, equity and due process; and\nThe University\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide a safe and non-discriminatory environment.\nIX.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Mandatory Reporting Obligations\nCertain UMBC community members have specific reporting obligations.\nA. Responsible Employees Reporting/Referral Obligations\nThe University recognizes that some UMBC community members may be most comfortable disclosing information about an incident of Prohibited Conduct to someone they know. Many University employees have been designated as Responsible Employees.\nB. Failure of a Responsible Employee to Report (Make Referral)\nIt is imperative that all Responsible Employees abide by their reporting/referral obligations in order to ensure that those who report are provided with prompt notice of the Complaint Process and the Supportive/Interim Measures available to them.\nAny Responsible Employee who is found to have knowingly failed to make a report/referral to the Title IX Coordinator, regarding alleged Prohibited Conduct that was reported to them, is in violation of this Policy and may be subject to sanctions including disciplinary action.\nC. Responsible Employees Identified\nFor purposes of this Policy, a Responsible Employee is defined as including any UMBC community member who (1) is an employee who has been given the duty of reporting/referring Prohibited Conduct under this Policy; or (2) is someone another UMBC community member could reasonably believe has this authority or duty.\nResponsible Employees are Non-Confidential which means they will safeguard the UMBC community member\xe2\x80\x99s privacy, however they are required to immediately share the known details of an incident of Prohibited Conduct (date, time, location, names of parties involved, description of the incident, etc.), to the Title IX Coordinator and other need-to-know University officials. Responsible Employees will try to ensure that any UMBC community member making a disclosure to a Responsible Employee, understands the Responsible Employee\xe2\x80\x99s reporting/referral obligations.\xc2\xa0 Those identified below have been designated as Responsible Employees\nTitle IX Coordinator;\nAll employees the Office of Equity and Civil Rights;\nAll employees in Human Resources;\nAll employees in the Office of the General Counsel;\nAll employees in the Office of Disability and Accessibility;\nAll University Police Department employees;\nAll UMBC Administrators (President, Provost, Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts, Deans, Associate Deans, Directors,\xc2\xa0 Chairs);\nAll UMBC Supervisors (excluding Supervisory Confidential Resources);\nAll UMBC Faculty (including Adjunct and Part-time);\nAll UMBC Graduate Assistant and Teaching Assistants;\nAll UMBC Academic Advisors;\nAll UMBC Athletic Coaches (including Volunteer Coaches) and Advisors;\nAll UMBC Resident Assistants and all employees in Residence Life; and\nAll UMBC First Responders (excluding First Responders who are Confidential Resources).\nD. Confidential Resources\nThe University understands that some individuals may not be prepared to make a report to law enforcement or to the University. Therefore, the University has Confidential Resources available to provide confidential counseling, crisis support, medical care, and/or advocacy services for UMBC community members affected by an incident of Prohibited Conduct.\xc2\xa0Conversations with these Confidential Resources will remain confidential, except, when there is an imminent or continuing threat to health or safety (as determined in the sole discretion of the University), there a disclosure of apparent or suspected abuse of a child or dependent adult, or other basis for disclosure, such as a legal obligation to reveal such information under enforceable court order.\nPastoral Counselors: Professional, licensed, or ordained clergy, who provide pastoral counseling to members of the UMBC community at the University, are Confidential Resources.\nProfessional Licensed Mental Health Providers: Professional, licensed mental health providers who provide mental-health counseling to members of the UMBC community, and also those who act in roles under the supervision of a licensed counselor, through the UMBC Counseling Center (for students) and the Employee Assistance Program (for employees) are Confidential Resources.\nProfessional Licensed Healthcare Providers: Professional, licensed healthcare providers who provide medical care to members of the UMBC community, and other health providers who act in roles under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider, through the University\xe2\x80\x99s Health Services, are Confidential Resources.\nNote of Caution:\xc2\xa0 A Confidential Resource Employee may also function in a different capacity, such as a Non-Confidential Employee. For instance, a Professional Licensed Mental Health Provider may also administer a course at UMBC, functioning as a faculty member. In such instances, the employee\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility is dictated by their functioning job title at the time the report is received.\nSo a Professional Licensed Mental Health Provider will be considered as a Confidential Resource so long as they are functioning as a Professional Licensed Mental Health Provider, when receiving the report. If the professional is administering a class on campus when the report is received, they will be considered a Non-Confidential Employee while they function as a faculty member.\nE. \xc2\xa0 Quasi-Confidential Resources\nIn addition to Confidential Resources, the University has Quasi-Confidential Resources available to provide crisis support and/or advocacy services for UMBC community members affected by an incident of Prohibited Conduct.\nQuasi-Confidential Resources will report incidents of Prohibited Conduct under this Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, but are not required to share any personally identifying information to the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator.\nQuasi-Confidential Resources include:\nLicensed Athletic Trainers, Non-Licensed Counselors, Non-Licensed Healthcare Providers, and/or Staff/Advocates who work or volunteer at the Counseling Center, University Health Services, or Women\xe2\x80\x99s Center and any designated Complainant or Respondent .\nConversations with these Quasi-Confidential Resources can remain confidential, except, when there is an imminent or continuing threat to health or safety (as determined in the sole discretion of the University), there a disclosure of apparent or suspected abuse of a child or dependent adult, or other basis for disclosure, such as a legal obligation to reveal such information under enforceable court order or subpoena.\nF.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Disclosures to Others / Responsibility to Report\nProhibited Conduct may be reported to people on campus who are not Responsible Employees, Confidential or Quasi-Confidential Resources.\nAll members of the UMBC community are strongly urged to forward and report all information received about an incident of Prohibited Conduct to the Title IX Coordinator.\nAll community members who witness or receive information about a child (under the age of 18) being abused or neglected, this information must be immediately reported, as explained in more detail below.\nG. Reporting Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect\nAny member of the UMBC community who suspects or observes a child (under age 18) being harmed is required to contact law enforcement by dialing 911 or 410.455.5555.\nIn addition, pursuant to Family Law Article of the Maryland Annotated Code, Sections 5-701 through 5-708, any member of the UMBC community, who has a reason to believe that a child has been abused or neglected, has a mandatory obligation to report that suspicion to the local department of social services or local police department and to the University\xe2\x80\x99s Designee for reporting child abuse.\nThe Baltimore County Department of Social Services: 410.853.3000\nUniversity Police Department: 410.455.5555\nBaltimore County Police Department: 410.887.2214\nUniversity\xe2\x80\x99s Designee/UMBC Title IX Coordinator 410.455.1717\nDetailed information regarding reporting suspected child abuse and neglect may be found at www.usmh.usmd.edu/regents/bylaws/SectionVI/VI150.pdf.\nX.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Guidance on Resolution of Formal Complaints\nA. Standard of Review\nThe standard of review for all complaints based on alleged violations of this Policy is preponderance of the evidence.\xc2\xa0 This is the same standard of review that is used in other proceedings at UMBC for Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment and for all allegations of involving discrimination.\nB. Confidentiality\nThe University must keep confidential the identity of anyone who has made a report or filed a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment, anyone who has been reported as perpetrator, any Respondent, and any witness, except as permitted by FERPA or required by law or to carry out the purposes of this Policy and Title IX.\nThe University must maintain as confidential any Supportive/Interim Measures provided to the parties, to the extent that maintaining confidentiality would not impair the ability to provide measures.\nConfidentiality restrictions imposed during the investigation must not not restrict a party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to (i) discuss the allegations under investigation, for example with a parent, friend, or other source of emotional support, or with an advocacy organization; or to (ii) gather and present evidence.\nThe University may require non-disclosure or confidentiality from complainants and respondents where no formal complaint is filed, and no investigation takes place.\nThe University may also require the Complainant, Respondent, Support Person, Advisor, Advocate or Attorney to agree not to further disseminate or disclose evidence, reports or documents shared as part of the investigation process.\nC. Time Frame for Resolution\nThe University will generally seek to resolve every report of Prohibited Conduct within sixty\xc2\xa0 to ninety (60-90) calendar days after receiving a Formal Complaint, excluding any appeal. There may be circumstances that prevent the University from meeting the sixty to ninety (60-90) calendar day timeline.\nThe time frame may be extended by the University for good cause, as determined on a case-by-case basis, in order to:\xc2\xa0 ensure the integrity and completeness of an investigation, comply with a request by law enforcement, reasonably accommodate the availability of witnesses, reasonably accommodate delays by the parties, account for University closures, or address other legitimate reasons, including the complexity of the investigation (e.g. the number of witnesses and volume of information provided by the parties) and the severity and extent of the alleged Prohibited Conduct.\nWhen the University is unable to meet the target timeline, the Parties will receive written notice regarding the extended time frame.\nD. Equitable Treatment\nThe University will treat Complainants and Respondents equitably by:\nProviding remedies to a Complainant where a determination of responsibility has been made against the Respondent, and by using procedures that comply with Title IX when investigating and adjudicating allegations of Sexual Harassment before the imposition of any sanctions or other actions that are not Supportive/Interim Measures against a Respondent (remedies must be designed to restore or preserve equal access to the institution\xe2\x80\x99s Education Program or Activity);\nProviding an equal opportunity for the parties to present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence; and\nApplying any provisions, rules, or practices used to investigate and adjudicate complaints under Title IX equally to both parties.\nE. Objective Evaluation of Evidence.\nThis Policy requires the objective evaluation of all relevant evidence\xe2\x80\x94including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.\nCredibility determinations may not be based on a person\xe2\x80\x99s status as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness.\nF. Conflict of Interest or Bias.\nAny individual designated as a Title IX Coordinator, investigator, or decision-maker; any decision-making body for a hearing or appeal; or any person designated to facilitate an informal resolution process, may not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or an individual Complainant or Respondent.\nThe University requires all individuals involved in responding to, investigating, and/or adjudicating matters under this Policy to disclose to the Office of Equity and Civil Rights/Title IX Coordinator any potential conflict of interest. A conflict of interest may arise when any of those persons, has been a participant or is related to a participant in the matter being investigated or reviewed, is related to or has had past substantial association with the Complainant or Respondent or a witness, or is biased, and/or lacks impartiality.\nG. Presumption of Non-Responsibility.\nThe University will presume that the Respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made, or the Respondent admits the conduct.\nH. Role of Support Person, Advocate or Attorney\nParties have the right to have access to and assistance from a support person, trained advocate or adviser or attorney throughout the disciplinary proceedings, including:\nPresence during any interview, Review Meeting or Hearing;\nPrivate consultations with the party during interviews, Review Meetings and Hearings, except during questioning of the party at a hearing;\nAssistance with the party\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of any right during the proceedings; and\nFor a student, access to counsel paid for by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC).\nThe presence of no more than two people, including a support person, advisor, attorney, or an advocate, at any hearing, meeting, or interview during the disciplinary proceedings.\nThe University will make reasonable efforts to accommodate the Support Person, Attorney or Advisor\xe2\x80\x99s/Advocate\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, while balancing the University\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to provide a prompt and equitable process.\nThe Support Person, Attorney, Advisor or Advocate may not delay, disrupt, or otherwise interfere with the outlined Procedures. The Support Person, Attorney, Advocate or Advisor will not be allowed to provide testimony or statements on behalf of the individual they are assisting.\nThe Support Person Attorney, Advisor or Advocate cannot be a fact witness or provide any statements as part of any process under the Procedures.\nI. Evidence that Cannot Be Considered\nPrivileged Information\nThe institution shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privilege;\nHealth Records\nThe institution cannot access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a party\xe2\x80\x99s records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professional\xe2\x80\x99s or paraprofessional\xe2\x80\x99s capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party, unless the institution obtains that party\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary, written to do so.\nMental Health Records\nAn adjudicating official, decision-maker or investigator is prohibited from considering evidence about a student\xe2\x80\x99s history of mental health counseling, treatment, or diagnosis, unless the student consents.\nPrior Sexual History\nSexual history will not be used for purposes of illustrating either party\xe2\x80\x99s individual character or reputation.\nAn adjudicating official or body is prohibited from considering a Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual history, behavior or predisposition, unless: (1) such questions and evidence are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the Prohibited Conduct; or (2) the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual behavior with the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. The mere fact of a current or previous dating or sexual relationship, by itself, is not sufficient to establish Consent.\nAn adjudicating official or body is prohibited from considering a Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual history with an individual other than a party to the proceedings, except to: (1) prove prior sexual misconduct; (2) support a claim that a student has an ulterior motive; or (3) impeach a student\xe2\x80\x99s credibility after that student has put their own prior sexual conduct at issue.\nJ. Co-Occurring Criminal Investigation\nPeople may report Prohibited Conduct to law enforcement before, during or after reporting to the University.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, the University process is not dependent on the status of or outcome of any criminal investigation or process.\xc2\xa0 That means that you can report conduct to both law enforcement, and the University, or you can report only to one or the other.\nBecause the standards for a violation of criminal laws are different from the standards under this Policy, the outcome of a criminal investigation or proceeding does not control whether or not something is found to violate this Policy; a policy violation may be found even if law enforcement agencies or prosecutors decline to prosecute.\nSince the University is required to conduct an investigation in a reasonably prompt time frame, in most cases, the University will not wait until a criminal investigation or proceeding begins or ends before conducting its own investigation or implementing Supportive/Interim Measures to protect the safety of the person reporting, and/or the entire UMBC campus community, if necessary.\nHowever, at the request of law enforcement, the University\xe2\x80\x99s investigation may be delayed temporarily, during the initial evidence gathering stage of the criminal investigation, as long as the delay does not inhibit the University\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond to the Prohibited Conduct in a prompt manner.\nWhere appropriate, if there is a pending criminal investigation regarding Prohibited Conduct that is also the subject of a Complaint to ECR, the University may coordinate with law enforcement consistent with student privacy rights and any applicable agreements with local law enforcement.\nK. Student Right to Access an Attorney paid for by MHEC\nUnder Maryland State Law, a current or former student who makes a Formal Complaint or responds to a Formal Complaint where a Title IX investigation is initiated, and who was enrolled as a student at the institution at the time of the incident that is the basis of the complaint, may have access to counsel paid for by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC), unless the student knowingly and voluntarily chooses not to have counsel.\xc2\xa0 Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 13B.09.01.\nA student may obtain from MHEC, through MHEC\xe2\x80\x99s website, a list of licensed attorneys and/or legal services programs who have indicated that they will represent such students in Title IX proceedings on a pro bono basis or for reduced legal fees.\nA student may contact, select and seek to retain an attorney from the MHEC list, at any time before the conclusion of formal Title IX proceedings.\xc2\xa0 A student\xe2\x80\x99s attorney may seek reimbursement of certain legal costs and fees from MHEC\xe2\x80\x99s Legal Representation Fund for Title IX Proceedings, subject to the availability of funding.\nXI. Investigation and Resolution of Formal Complaints\nA. Which Procedures Apply\nSexual Harassment I:\xc2\xa0 The procedures include a Notice of Complaint, Investigation, Opportunity to Review a Draft Report and Evidence, Live Title IX Hearing, Decision and Appeal.\xc2\xa0 The requirements for those procedures are set forth in further detail below.\nGender Dissemination, Sexual Exploitation, and Sexual Harassment II:\xc2\xa0 The procedures include a Notice of Complaint, Investigation, Opportunity to Review a Draft Report and Evidence, Review Meeting, Decision and Appeal. The requirements for those procedures are set forth in further detail below.\nB. Supportive/Interim Measures\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall offer Supportive/Interim Measures to the Complainant and Respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed.\nSupportive/Interim Measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the parties before or after the filing of a Formal Complaint or where no Formal Complaint has been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the Education Program or Activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of the parties, the safety of the community or the institution\xe2\x80\x99s educational environment, deter Prohibited Conduct or to ensure the integrity of the investigative and/or adjudicative processes.\nThe University must maintain as confidential any Supportive/Interim Measures provided to the Complainant or Respondent, unless maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the recipient to provide the supportive/interim measures. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the effective implementation of supportive/interim measures.\nSupportive/Interim Measures may include, but are not limited to, counseling, extensions of deadlines or other course-related or academic accommodations and adjustments, change in class schedule, including the ability to drop a course without penalty or to transfer sections, if such alternatives are available and feasible; modifications of a work schedule, work location, or job assignment, if such alternatives are available and feasible; arranging for an incomplete grade in a class, permitting a leave of absence, or withdrawal, including a retroactive withdrawal; change in campus housing assignment or housing license, if such alternatives are available and feasible; assistance from University support staff in completing University housing assignments; to the extent practicable, preserving eligibility for academic, athletic, or other scholarships, institution-based financial aid, or program eligibility; providing alternative course completion options, campus escort services, referrals to counseling, health services, or academic support services, restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in housing locations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus, restricting access to the University or to certain University facilities, resources, or activities pending resolution of the report, and other similar measures.\nSupportive/Interim Measures may be requested by the Reporting Party or the Responding Party, or the University can initiate Supportive/Interim Measures in the absence of a request, at any time, during the process.\xc2\xa0 Individuals can make a request for Supportive/Interim Measures, in-person or in-writing by contacting the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator.\xc2\xa0 The Title IX Coordinator, in consultation with the University, is responsible for implementing reasonable and appropriate Supportive/Interim Measures.\nC. Notice of Complaint\nUpon receipt of a Formal Complaint, the University will provide written notice to known parties:\nOf the investigation and adjudication process, including any informal process;\nOf the allegations including sufficient details known at the time and with sufficient time to prepare a response before any initial interview;\n\xe2\x80\x9cSufficient details\xe2\x80\x9d include the identities of the parties involved in the incident, if known, the conduct allegedly constituting Prohibited Conduct, and the date and location of the alleged incident, if known;\nThe presumption that Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the investigation and adjudication process;\nThat the parties may have a support person, advisor or attorney with them at any meeting or interview\nThat they have the right to inspect and review evidence before a report is issued;\nThat the UMBC Code of Student Conduct and other University policies prohibit knowingly making false statements, furnishing false information to any University official or office, and submitting false or misleading information during any University investigation or adjudication process; and\nThat if the institution decides to investigate additional allegations not included in the original notice, the Respondent will be provided notice of the additional allegations.\nD. Title IX Dismissals\nMandatory Dismissal\nIf the conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint would not constitute Sexual Harassment I, even if proved, did not occur in the institution\xe2\x80\x99s Education Program or Activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, then the institution must dismiss the Formal Complaint with regard to that conduct for the purposes of Title IX. A Title IX dismissal does not preclude consideration of the matter under the process applicable to Sexual Misconduct, Gender Dissemination, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Harassment II and Retaliation, or under the University\xe2\x80\x99s Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy.\nPermissive Dismissal\nThe institution may dismiss the Formal Complaint or any allegations therein, if at any time during the investigation or hearing:\na. Complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the Complainant would like to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any allegations therein;\nb. the Respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by the institution; or\nc. specific circumstances prevent the institution from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint or allegations therein.\nNotice of Title IX Dismissal\nUpon making a determination that the University will issue a Title IX Dismissal, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly send written notice of the dismissal and reason(s) therefore to the parties. The notice will contain information regarding whether or not the Office of Equity and Civil Rights will continue the investigation or resolution under the procedures applicable Sexual Misconduct, under this Policy and/or those under the Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy.\nE. Consolidation of Formal Complaints\nThe University may consolidate Formal Complaints against more than one Respondent, or by more than one Complainant against one or more Respondents, or by one party against the other party, where the allegations arise out of the same facts or circumstances.\nThe University shall promptly notify the Parties if, in its sole discretion, it determines that\xc2\xa0 matters should be consolidated.\nF. Investigation of a Formal Complaint.\nWhen investigating a Formal Complaint and throughout the investigation and adjudication process, the University will:\nEnsure that the burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rest on the institution and not on the parties,\nProvide an equal opportunity for the parties to present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence;\nProvide the parties with the same opportunities to have others present during any investigation or adjudication proceeding, including the opportunity to be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by the advisor of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney, and not limit the choice or presence of advisor for either the Complainant or Respondent in any meeting or proceeding; however, the institution may establish restrictions regarding the extent to which the advisor may participate in the meetings or proceedings, as long as the restrictions apply equally to both parties;\nProvide, to a party whose participation is invited or expected, written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all hearings, investigative interviews, or other meetings, with sufficient time for the party to prepare to participate;\nProvide both parties an equal opportunity to inspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in a Formal Complaint, including the evidence upon which the institution does not intend to rely in reaching a determination regarding responsibility and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a party or other source, so that each party can meaningfully respond to the evidence prior to the conclusion of the investigation.\nMake all evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in a Formal Complaint available at any Title IX Hearing or Review Meeting to give each party equal opportunity to refer to such evidence.\nPrior to completion of the investigative report, send to each party and the party\xe2\x80\x99s advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and review in an electronic format or a hard copy, and provide the parties at least 10 days to submit a written response, which the investigator will consider prior to completion of the investigative report.\nCreate an investigative report that fairly summarizes relevant evidence.\nProvide each party and Advisor, if any, the investigative report in an electronic format or a hard copy, at least 10 days prior to any Title IX Hearing or Review Meeting, and give them 10 days to submit a written response.\nG. Decision-Maker\nThe University has the discretion to use either a Sole Decision-Maker or Board of Review comprised of trained personnel to hold a Title IX Hearing or Review Meeting.\nThe University will ensure that the single decision-maker or Board of Review have had the requisite training and confirm that there is no actual conflict of interest, bias, or lack of impartiality.\xc2\xa0 A student may not serve as a Board of Review member under the Procedures.\nThe role of the Board of Review or Sole Decision-Maker is to independently determine whether a Policy violation did or did not occur, based upon the preponderance of the evidence standard, and if warranted, determine the appropriate sanctions.\nThe role of the Board of Review and the Sole External Reviewer, is not to re-investigate the matter. The Board of Review or Sole External Reviewer shall make the final determination(s) regarding credibility of all the information/evidence presented. However, no negative inferences related to final credibility determinations, shall be made, because a party does not appear or does not participate at the scheduled meeting.\nH. Live Title IX Hearing with Cross-Examination Required for Complaints of Sexual Harassment I.\nA live hearing with cross-examination of witnesses is required to adjudicate Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment I, including Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking.\nAt the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must permit each party\xe2\x80\x99s advisor to ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility.\nCross-examination at the live hearing must be conducted directly, orally, and in real time by the party\xe2\x80\x99s advisor of choice and never by a party personally.\nOnly relevant cross-examination and other questions may be asked of a party or witness.\nBefore a Complainant, Respondent, or witness answers a cross-examination or other question, the decision-maker(s) must first determine whether the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant.\nIf a party does not have an advisor present at the live hearing to conduct cross-examination on behalf of that party, the institution must provide without fee or charge to that party, an advisor of the institution\xe2\x80\x99s choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney, to conduct cross-examination on behalf of that party.\nLive hearings may be conducted with all parties physically present in the same geographic location or, at the institution\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, any or all parties, witnesses, and other participants may appear at the live hearing virtually, with technology enabling participants simultaneously to see and hear each other.\nThe University will create a single audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of any live hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review.\xc2\xa0 The recording will be the property of the University.\nI. Review Meeting to Resolve Complaints of Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment II, and Discrimination under this Policy.\nA Sole Decision-Maker or Review Board is identified and notice of the meeting is provided to the parties.\nThe University will create a single audio/audiovisual recording or transcript, of any live hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review. The recording will be the property of the University.\nThe investigator presents the report, recommendation, and conclusion for no longer than fifteen (15) minutes; the Board of Review or Sole Decision-Maker may, but is not required to, ask questions.\nThe Reporting Party has an opportunity to give a closing and/or impact statement no longer than fifteen (15) minutes; the Board of Review or Sole Decision-Maker may, but is not required to, ask questions.\nThe Responding Party has an opportunity to give a closing and/or impact statement.no longer than fifteen (15) minutes; the Board of Review or Sole Decision-Maker may, but is not required to, ask questions.\nThe parties cannot ask questions of one another.\nThe Board of Review or Sole Decision-Maker may: (a). Accept the Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s recommended finding(s); (b). Reject the Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s recommended finding(s); or (c). Refer the matter back for further/additional Investigation.\nJ. Determination Regarding Responsibility.\nAfter any Title IX Hearing or Review Meeting, the decision-maker(s), who cannot be the same as the Title IX Coordinator or the investigator(s), must issue, a written determination regarding responsibility, which must include:\nIdentification of the allegations potentially constituting Prohibited Conduct;\nA description of the procedural steps taken from receipt of the Formal Complaint through the determination, including any notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other evidence, and hearings held;\nFindings of fact supporting the determination;\nConclusions regarding the application of the policy to the facts;\nA statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a determination regarding responsibility,\nA determination of sanctions the institution will impose on the Respondent,\nWhether remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to the Education Program or Activity will be provided to the Complainant; and\nProcedures and permissible bases for parties to appeal.\nK. Appeals.\nThe appeal process is equally available to the parties.\nThe University has the discretion to use either a Sole Decision-Maker or Board of Review comprised of trained personnel to determine an appeal.\xc2\xa0 The Decision-Maker or Board may not be the same as those who presided over the Title IX Hearing or Review Meeting.\nGrounds for Appeal\nAny party may appeal a determination regarding responsibility, or dismissal of a Formal Complaint or any allegations therein, on the following bases:\nProcedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;\nNew evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; and\nThe Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision- maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the individual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter;\nExcessiveness or insufficiency of the sanctioning decision.\nMere dissatisfaction or mere deviations from procedures that were not so substantial as to deny a party notice or a fair opportunity to be heard, are not valid bases for an Appeal.\nAppeal\nAs to all appeals, the University will:\nNotify the other party in writing when an appeal is filed and implement appeal procedures equally for both parties;\nEnsure that the decision-maker(s) for the appeal is not the same person as the decision-maker(s) that reached the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal, the investigator(s), or the Title IX Coordinator;\nGive both parties a reasonable, equal opportunity to submit a written statement in support of, or challenging, the outcome, and provide an opportunity for them to respond to the other party\xe2\x80\x99s appeal submission;\nIssue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result; and\nProvide the written decision simultaneously to both parties.\nL. Final Decision.\nThe determination regarding responsibility becomes final either on the date that the University provides the parties with the written determination of the result of the appeal, if an appeal is filed, or if an appeal is not filed, the date on which an appeal would no longer be considered timely.\nM. Disciplinary Actions or Sanctions\nThis Policy prohibits a broad range of conduct, which is serious in nature.\nIn keeping with the University\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to fostering an environment that is safe, respectful, inclusive, and free of Prohibited Conduct, this Policy allows for wide latitude in the imposition of disciplinary actions or sanctions and/or conditions tailored to the facts and circumstances of each report, the impact of the Prohibited Conduct on the Reporting Party and surrounding UMBC community members, and accountability for the Responding Party.\nThe imposition of disciplinary actions (in employment context) or sanctions (in educational context) are designed to eliminate Prohibited Conduct under the Policy, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects, while supporting the University\xe2\x80\x99s mission and federal obligations.\nDisciplinary actions or sanctions may include educational, restorative, rehabilitative, and punitive components. Some conduct, however, is so egregious in nature, so harmful to the individuals involved and the entire UMBC community, or so deleterious to the educational or working environment, that it requires severe disciplinary action, up to and including termination from or dismissal from the University.\nDisciplinary actions which may be imposed on faculty, staff, and student employees in the employment context, can include, but are not limited to the following: no contact orders, letter of reprimand, censure, service to the University, counseling, retraining, transfer, demotion, suspension, and/or termination.\nSanctions which may be imposed on students in the academic context, can include, but are not limited to the following: no contact orders, housing restrictions (including removal from on-campus housing), community service, educational requirements, written warning, reprimand, probation, suspension, and/or dismissal. Further, the University reserves the right to delay or refuse the conferring of an academic degree\xe2\x80\x94undergraduate or graduate\xe2\x80\x94during the pendency of an investigation.\nIndividuals who commit certain Prohibited Conduct in violation of federal, state, or local law may also be subject to criminal charges and penalties.\nN.  Conditions\nIn certain circumstances, even when there are no disciplinary actions or sanctions imposed, the University reserves the right to impose certain conditions upon any party who is subject to this Policy. Conditions may be imposed as Supportive/Interim Measures, as part of an Informal Resolution, or as part of a final Sanction after a Hearing or Review Meeting.\nConditions are designed to prevent any Prohibited Conduct under the Policy, cultivate a safe academic and employment environment, and maintain public order on campus, while supporting the University\xe2\x80\x99s mission and federal obligations. Conditions are not disciplinary actions or sanctions.\nXII. \xc2\xa0 Informal Resolution\nInformal Resolution may be used to resolve alleged violations of this Policy subject to the following conditions:\nThe University may not offer or facilitate an informal resolution process to resolve allegations of Sexual Assault, Sexual Coercion or allegations that an employee sexually harassed a student.\nThe University may not require as a condition of enrollment or continuing enrollment, or employment or continuing employment, or enjoyment of any other right, waiver of the right to an investigation and adjudication of Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment.\nThe University may not require the parties to participate in an informal resolution process.\nThe University may not offer informal resolution process in a Sexual Assault or Sexual Harassment I matter until/ unless a Formal Complaint is filed.\nAt any time prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility, the University may facilitate an informal resolution process, such as mediation, that does not involve a full investigation and adjudication, provided that the University:\nProvides to the parties a written notice disclosing (1) the allegations, (2) the requirements of the informal resolution process including the circumstances where parties are precluded from filing a Formal Complaint arising from the same allegations, provided, however, that at any time prior to agreeing to a resolution, any party has the right to withdraw from the informal resolution process and resume the investigation and adjudication process with respect to the Formal Complaint, and (3) any consequences resulting from participating in the informal resolution process, including the records that will be maintained or could be shared;\nObtains the parties\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary, written consent to the informal resolution process.\nXIII.\xc2\xa0 Clery Act Compliance and Release of Information\nIn handling reports related to Prohibited Conduct, the University remains responsible for complying with the requirements of the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990 (\xe2\x80\x9cClery Act\xe2\x80\x9d) and the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) amendments to the Clery Act.\nThe University will comply with Clery and VAWA requirements, including crime recording and reporting requirements, where compliance is not otherwise reached by actions under this Policy.\nPursuant to the Clery Act, anonymous statistical information regarding reported criminal incidents must be shared with the UMBC Police Department for inclusion in the daily crime log. This information will be included in the University\xe2\x80\x99s Annual Security Report and the University may also share aggregate and non-personally identifiable data about reports, outcomes, and sanctions.\nXIV. Agreements with Local Law Enforcement and Rape Crisis Programs\nUMBC has formalized agreements with (1) Baltimore County Police Department, and (2) TurnAround, Inc. The agreement with Baltimore County Police Department complies with Title IX and outlines when the University will refer a matter to the Baltimore County Police Department. The agreement with TurnAround, Inc., formalizes a commitment to provide trauma-informed services to Reporting Parties of sexual assault and to improve the University\xe2\x80\x99s overall response to sexual assault.\nXV.\xc2\xa0 University Sexual Assault Climate Survey\nOn or before March 1, 2016, and at least every two (2) years thereafter, the University will develop and administer a Sexual Assault campus climate survey to students, using nationally recognized best practices for research and climate surveys, in accordance with the procedures set by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC). On or before June 1, 2016, and at least every two (2) years thereafter, the University shall submit to MHEC a report in accordance with the requirements set forth in Md. Code Annotated, Education Article, Section 11-601(g).\nXVI. Education, Prevention and Training\nA.

Report\nDecision\nAppeal\nSanctions and/or Conditions\nConditions\nSanctions\n(1) Introduction\nUMBC has developed the following procedure to provide prompt and equitable resolution of discrimination complaints under UMBC\xe2\x80\x99s Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy.\xc2\xa0 Matters that are covered by the Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy as well as the Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment and Gender Discrimination but are required or permitted to be dismissed under the Sexual Misconduct Policy, may be handled pursuant to this procedure.\nUse of this procedure does not affect other rights, remedies or applicable time limits that may apply under other UMBC policies, or local, federal, and state statutes and regulations prohibiting discrimination, harassment and retaliation.\nThis Procedure protects and provides recourse to all UMBC students, faculty and staff, guests, visitors, volunteers, invitees, and campers as well as third parties and contractors under UMBC\xe2\x80\x99s control (including but not limited to, admitted students, undergraduate, graduate, exchange, visiting, professional, doctoral, and post-doctoral students, and temporary and contingent faculty and staff) if, when and while they are attempting to participate or participating in a UMBC program, activity or employment.\n(2) Confidentiality\nThe Office of Equity and Civil Rights will keep the information reported under the Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy confidential including the identity of anyone who has made a report or filed a Complaint, and the identity of any Respondent or witness, except under certain limited circumstances.\nLimited disclosure may also be required: (1) to provide supportive measures; (2) where the information reported discloses an immediate or continuing threat to the health or safety of the parties, witnesses or the University community; (3) where there is a disclosure of apparent or suspected abuse of a child or dependent adult; (4) as permitted by FERPA; or (5) where there is some other legal obligation to make a specific disclosure.\nThe University must maintain as confidential any Supportive Measures provided to impacted parties, other than as necessary to provide those measures and to the extent that maintaining confidentiality would not impair the ability to provide such measures.\nThe University may require non-disclosure or confidentiality from impacted parties, complainants and respondents, even where no formal complaint is filed, and no investigation takes place.\nConfidentiality restrictions imposed during the investigation must not not restrict a party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to (i) discuss the allegations under investigation, for example with a parent, friend, support person, advisor, advocate or attorney,\xc2\xa0 (ii) gather and present evidence, or to (iii) seek or assist with securing confidential services from a healthcare provider including a mental healthcare provider or other similar resources.\nThe University may also require the impacted parties, the Complainant, Respondent, Support Person, Advisor, Advocate or Attorney to agree not to further disseminate or disclose evidence, reports or documents shared as part of the investigation process, except as required by law or to comply with a lawfully issued court order.\n(3) Resolution of Complaints\nReporting a matter to ECR does not mean that the person intends to file a formal complaint or that the person is requesting that the University take action or investigate the conduct.\nReports may be submitted via the online reporting/referral form or by contacting the Office of Equity and Civil Rights at ecr@umbc.edu\xc2\xa0or 410-455-1717.\nIndividuals who believe they have experienced or witnessed conduct that may be a violation of the Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy are encouraged to report the conduct as soon as possible.\nEmployees are asked to report conduct that has been reported to them by a student or another employee immediately, including, if known, the names of those involved, names of any witnesses, and the time, place, location and description of the conduct.\nFormal Complaints\nThe University will respond to all Formal Complaints of discrimination.\nAny Formal Complaint must be filed not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the person became aware of the alleged discrimination, harassment or retaliation.\xc2\xa0 Prompt filing after an action assists ECR in effectively reviewing the complaint.\nWritten complaints are encouraged, but not required.\nIn order to file a Formal Complaint a reporting party may indicate that they are intending to file a Formal Complaint in their online report or can send an email to ecr@umbc.edu indicating they wish to file a formal complaint.\nIf a verbal complaint is made, the Office of Equity and Civil Rights may prepare a written statement of the allegations and ask that the Complainant acknowledge its accuracy in writing.\nAll Formal Complaints must contain the following information:\n(a) Name, address and telephone number of the person filing the complaint;\n(b) A brief description of the alleged discrimination or harassment, including the location and date of the alleged discrimination or harassment, and any other people who may have relevant information; and\n(c) The remedy, result or resolution sought.\nSupportive Measures\nSupportive Measures may be requested by an impacted party, the Complainant or the Respondent, or continue from a matter initially brought under the Sexual Misconduct Policy.\xc2\xa0 Supportive Measures may also be implemented by the Office of Equity and Civil Rights as an appropriate Interim and/or Supportive Measures while the matter is being assessed, evaluated, resolved or investigated.\nExamples of Interim and/or Supportive Measures include, but are not limited to, a referral to the Employee Assistance Program (\xe2\x80\x9cEAP\xe2\x80\x9d), or the Student Counseling Center, academic adjustments (if such alternatives are feasible and available), modifications in work location or schedule (if such alternatives are feasible and available), academic support, and no contact instructions\nInitial Assessment\nThe Office will acknowledge receipt of a report or Formal Complaint by sending a notification to and speak to the reporting and/or complaining party and conduct an initial assessment of the complaint to determine whether the matter is covered by the University\xe2\x80\x99s Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy or other Policy, whether informal resolution may be possible, and whether or not a formal complaint should or could be investigated.\nIn assessing the appropriate response to a report or Complaint, ECR will consider a number of factors including but not limited to: the reporter or Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s position as to whether or not the complaint should be investigated; whether the Respondent is currently enrolled in or employed by the University; whether under the circumstances it will be possible for the University to gather evidence sufficient to reach a determination in any investigation.\nIf a Formal Complaint has been filed and it has not been informally resolved within thirty (30) days of receipt of the complaint, the Office of Equity and Civil Rights shall confer with the Complainant about how the matter should proceed and whether or not there should be a formal investigation.\nWhere a Complainant does not request a formal investigation, a formal investigation may also commence at the University\xe2\x80\x99s discretion after consideration of a number of factors, including but not limited to the nature and scope of the alleged conduct, and the University\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide a safe and non-discriminatory environment.\nInvestigation\nIf the Office of Equity and Civil Rights determines that the matter should be investigated, a Notice of Investigation will be issued which identifies the investigator and provides the Complainant and Respondent written notice of the Complaint.\xc2\xa0 An investigation does not begin until a formal Notice of Investigation has been issued.\nAll parties and identified witnesses shall cooperate during the investigation by being available during reasonable business hours to discuss the complaint and provide relevant information requested by the investigator.\nThe investigator will interview the Complainant and the Respondent and other available relevant witnesses, review available relevant documents and prepare a written report. The investigator in consultation with ECR will determine the order of any interviews and the relevancy of witnesses and documents.\nTiming\nThe Office seeks to complete a Formal Investigation within ninety (90) business days and may extend the time frame set forth in these procedures for good cause.\nThe time frame may be extended by the University for good cause, as determined on a case-by-case basis, including, but not limited to the following:\xc2\xa0 to ensure the integrity and completeness of an investigation, to comply with a request by a state or federal agency, to reasonably accommodate the access to and the availability of witnesses, to accommodate reasonable requests for additional time by the parties, to account for University closures or limitations on operations, for other reasons, including the complexity of the investigation (e.g. the number of witnesses and volume of information provided by the parties) and the time period, length of time, severity and extent of the alleged Prohibited Conduct.\nDraft Report\nAfter completion of the investigation, the investigator will prepare a report.\nThe report will provide a determination as to whether, based on a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not), the conduct violates the University\xe2\x80\x99s Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy and/or other UMBC policies, applicable local, state, and federal harassment, anti-discrimination and retaliation laws.\nIn addition, if applicable, the report may recommend options for substantive resolution of the complaint and recommendations for corrective measures, conditions or sanctions.\xc2\xa0 In making any such recommendations, the investigator may confer with Student Conduct, Student Affairs, the Office of the Provost, Human Resources, and/or ECR as appropriate.\nAfter a Draft Report has been prepared, the parties will be provided with an opportunity to review and respond to the Draft Report, and all documents relied upon by the investigator.\nResponses to the Draft report must be provided within 10 business days.\xc2\xa0 Requests for additional time will be determined on a case-by-case basis, however, reasonable requests will be granted.\nThe Draft Investigative Report review period is both parties\xe2\x80\x99 final opportunity to identify or submit any additional evidence, information, questions, or witnesses, before the report and investigative recommendation are finalized and issued.\nIn the absence of demonstrable good cause, information discoverable through the exercise of due diligence that is not provided to the investigator during the Draft Report review period will not be considered by the Investigator or decision-maker/s or during any appeal.\nFinal Report\nAfter the parties have reviewed the Draft report and provided any comments, a Final Investigative Report will be issued.\xc2\xa0 The report will then be sent to the Provost or their designee for a decision.\n(4) Decision\nWithin twenty (20) business days of receipt of the Final Report, the Provost (or their designee) shall make a decision based on the investigation record and shall notify the Complainant and Respondent, in writing, of the decision and the basis for the decision.\nWith respect to any remedy or sanction, the Provost or other decision maker/s may confer with Student Conduct, Student Affairs, the Office of the Provost, Human Resources, and/or ECR as appropriate.\n(5) Appeal\nIf either the Complainant or Respondent is not satisfied with the decision of the Provost (or their designee), the party may file a written appeal within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Provost (or designee)\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\nThe written appeal must include a detailed statement of the basis of the appeal. If an appeal is received from one party, the other party will be notified and given ten (10) business days to submit a response.\nPermissible grounds for appeal are limited to the following:\nProcedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;\nNew evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter;\nThe investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the individual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; or\nExcessiveness or insufficiency of the remedy or sanction.\nMere dissatisfaction or mere deviations from procedures that were not so substantial as to deny a party notice or a fair opportunity to be heard, are not valid bases for an Appeal.\nThe University has the discretion to use either a Sole Decision-Maker or Board of Review composed of trained personnel to determine an appeal.\xc2\xa0 The Decision-Maker or Board may not be the same as the original decision maker.\nThe appeal review decision-maker or review panel shall review the decision and notify the Complainant and Respondent of the final decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of the appeal.\n(6) Sanctions and/or Conditions\nConditions\nIn certain circumstances, even when there is no finding and/or there are no disciplinary actions or sanctions imposed, the University reserves the right to impose Conditions upon any party who is subject to the Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy.\nConditions are designed to prevent violations of the Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy and cultivate a safe and equitable academic and employment environment, while supporting the University\xe2\x80\x99s mission and federal obligations. Conditions are non-disciplinary and may include educational, remedial or Supportive Measures that may be imposed by the University upon any party who is, or was at the time of the events, subject to this Policy.\xc2\xa0 The University may impose Conditions even where no formal complaint has been filed, and no formal finding or decision regarding responsibility for prohibited conduct has been made.\nSanctions\nSanctions are effective after a Final Decision has been issued and any Appeal has been decided.\xc2\xa0 Sanctions are designed to eliminate violations of the Policy, prevent their recurrence, and remedy their effects, while supporting the University\xe2\x80\x99s mission and federal obligations.\nSanctions may include educational, restorative, rehabilitative, and punitive components. Some conduct, however, is so egregious in nature, so harmful to the individuals involved and the entire UMBC community, or so deleterious to the educational or working environment, that it requires severe disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, termination from or dismissal from the University.\nSanctions for employees (including student employees) may include, but are not limited to: a no contact order, letter of reprimand or warning, censure, service to the University, counseling, retraining, transfer, demotion, suspension, and/or termination.\nSanctions for students may include, but are not limited to: no contact orders, housing restrictions (including removal from on-campus housing), community service, educational requirements, written warning, reprimand, probation, suspension, and/or dismissal. The University also reserves the right to delay or refuse the conferring of an academic degree\xe2\x80\x94undergraduate or graduate.\nWith respect to faculty Respondents, matters decided under this Procedure are not subject to the faculty grievance procedures.\xc2\xa0 However, if the final decision is a recommendation for termination or dismissal of a tenured or tenure-track faculty member, the Respondent may request review of the recommendation consistent with the University System of Maryland Policy on Appointment, Rank, and Tenure of Faculty.\nAmended Effective:\xc2\xa0 November 29, 2021\nLocation\nAdministration Building        9th Floor\nContact\nPhone: 410-455-1717Contact Us\nOffice of Equity and Civil Rights on myUMBC\nUMBC\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County\n1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250\nDirections & Parking Information\nResources\nAlumni\nCareer Center\nEvents\nGet Help\nNews\nVisit Campus\nWork at UMBC\nImportant Contacts\nOnline Directory\nContact UMBC\nRequest Support\nEmergency Info\nUMBC Police:\n410-455-5555\nSign Up for Text Alerts\nContact Us\nRequest Info\nApply\nTop Stories of the Week\nEnter email to subscribe\nGo\n\xc2\xa9 UMBC: A University System of Maryland Member Institution\nAccreditation\nConsumer Information\nEqual Opportunity\nPrivacyPDF Download\nTitle IX\nWeb Accessibility\nSubscribe to UMBC Weekly Top Stories\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nI am interested in:\nI am interested in: Undergraduate\nI am interested in: Graduate\nI am interested in: Professional Masters'"];

We would like to hear from all of you, and have designed the survey to support both privacy and candor.\nThe purpose of the Campus Climate Survey is to better understand how students experience diversity and inclusion, and to understand the scope and nature of sexual misconduct, including experiences with, attitudes about, and behaviors toward sexual violence.\nThe information is critical to tailoring diversity and inclusion efforts, and sexual violence prevention education programming and to improving the campus response. This survey will be administered to all of the approximately 13,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students that are enrolled at UMBC.\nWe look forward to robust participation. \xc2\xa0If you have questions please consult our FAQ page.\nLocation\nAdministration Building        9th Floor\nContact\nPhone: 410-455-1717Contact Us\nOffice of Equity and Civil Rights on myUMBC\nUMBC\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County\n1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250\nDirections & Parking Information\nResources\nAlumni\nCareer Center\nEvents\nGet Help\nNews\nVisit Campus\nWork at UMBC\nImportant Contacts\nOnline Directory\nContact UMBC\nRequest Support\nEmergency Info\nUMBC Police:\n410-455-5555\nSign Up for Text Alerts\nContact Us\nRequest Info\nApply\nTop Stories of the Week\nEnter email to subscribe\nGo\n\xc2\xa9 UMBC: A University System of Maryland Member Institution\nAccreditation\nConsumer Information\nEqual Opportunity\nPrivacyPDF Download\nTitle IX\nWeb Accessibility\nSubscribe to UMBC Weekly Top Stories\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nI am interested in:\nI am interested in: Undergraduate\nI am interested in: Graduate\nI am interested in: Professional Masters'"];
