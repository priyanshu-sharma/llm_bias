Through our policies and procedures, UMB not only fulfills its regulatory requirements, it also communicates the expectations UMB has for our community, the actions required, or requested, of our community if they experience or observe sexual misconduct, and the actions our community can expect from UMB when it receives reports of sexual misconduct.\nTitle IX: Policies and Procedures\nThe current UMB policies and procedures regarding prohibited sex discrimination are:\nUMB\xc2\xa0Notice of Non-Discrimination\xc2\xa0[VI-1.00(C)]\nUMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0[VI-1.60(A)]\nUMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX Procedures\xe2\x80\x9d\nUMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \xe2\x80\x9cNon-Title IX Procedures\xe2\x80\x9d\nUMB Student Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures\xc2\xa0[VI-1.05(B)]\nUMB Employee Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures\xc2\xa0[VI-1.05(A)]\nUMB Policy Concerning Consensual Relationships\xc2\xa0 [VII-2.10(B)]\nReporting Requirements\nUnder the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct, all UMB employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct that they regard as a violation of the policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority.

I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.\nIn addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the\xc2\xa0University\xe2\x80\x99s non-discrimination policies,\xc2\xa0and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.\nAny student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.\xc2\xa0 Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.\nShould you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about\xc2\xa0University policies \xc2\xa0regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.\nAs a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.\nThank you for helping to make our campus a harassment-free environment.\nRoger J.

Sexual Misconduct\nAdministration\n|\nApproved August 14, 2020\nResponsible VP/AVP\nSusan C. Buskirk, DM, MS\nRevision History\nApproved by the President March 30, 2015, replaced V1-1.30(A), to comply with USM V1-1.60 (eff. June 27, 2014, revised June 19, 2015); Revised August 26, 2015; Revised August 14, 2020; Revised March 24, 2023 to update links.\nPolicy Statement I. PURPOSE\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore (\xe2\x80\x9cUMB\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cInstitution\xe2\x80\x9d) is committed to providing a learning and working environment free from Sexual Misconduct, as defined in Section III of this Policy.\xc2\xa0 UMB prohibits and will not tolerate Sexual Misconduct. Sexual Misconduct is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by state and federal laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 as amended (\xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX\xe2\x80\x9d) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and some forms of Sexual Misconduct may constitute criminal activity. UMB endeavors to foster a climate free from Sexual Misconduct through training, education, prevention programs, and policies and procedures that promote prompt reporting, prohibit retaliation, and promote timely, fair, and impartial investigation and resolution of Sexual Misconduct cases in a manner that eliminates the Sexual Misconduct, prevents its reoccurrence, and addresses its effects.\nII. SCOPE\nA. Applicability and Jurisdiction\nAll students, faculty, and staff, as well as third parties and contractors under UMB control, are subject to this Policy regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This Policy applies to Sexual Misconduct in connection with any UMB educational program or activity, including Sexual Misconduct (1) in any UMB facility or on any UMB property; (2) in connection with any UMB sponsored, recognized or approved program, visit, or activity, regardless of location and inclusive of the online environment; (3) that impedes equal access to any UMB educational program or activity or adversely effects the employment of a member of the UMB community; or (4) that otherwise threatens the health or safety of a member of the UMB community. Nothing in this Policy is intended to supersede or conflict with any federal compliance obligation.\nFederal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) require that UMB implement certain procedures when UMB obtains Actual Knowledge of Sexual Harassment in its Education Programs or Activities against a person in the United States. UMB will address all allegations to determine whether the conduct occurred in the context of its employment or educational program or activity and/or has continuing effects on the campus or in an off-campus UMB program or activity, violating UMB policy. Prohibited Sexual Misconduct that violates UMB policy that does not fall under the scope of Title IX either because it occurs outside the United States or because it does not fall within Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s definition of Sexual Harassment will be addressed using alternate processes as more fully described in UMB\xe2\x80\x99s procedures.\nIf the Respondent is unknown or is not a member of the UMB community, the Title IX Coordinator will assist the Complainant (and the reporting party if someone other than the alleged victim has reported the Sexual Misconduct) in identifying appropriate campus and local resources and support options. UMB may take other actions as appropriate, such as barring a third party from UMB property and/or events. When the Respondent is enrolled in or employed by another USM institution, the Title IX Coordinator can assist in liaising with the appropriate individual for that institution and, in some instances, may make a report to the institution, as the alleged conduct may be prohibited by that school\xe2\x80\x99s policies. Similarly, the Title IX Coordinator may be able to provide support to a student or employee who reports discrimination in an externship, study abroad program, or other environment external to UMB.\nB. Protection of Minors\nIn Maryland, a person under the age of 16 years cannot consent to sexual activity. This means that sexual contact by an individual over the age of 18 with a person younger than 16 years old may be a crime, could require an immediate report to the applicable child welfare agency and/or local law enforcement agency, and represents a potential violation of this Policy, even if the minor appeared to welcome the sexual activity. See UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Procedures for Reporting Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect (VI-1.50(A)) for mandatory requirements for Sexual Misconduct that includes a minor.\nC. Academic Freedom\nThis Policy is not meant to inhibit or prohibit educational content or discussions inside or outside of the classroom that include controversial or sensitive subject matters protected by academic freedom.\nD. Guidance\nUMB encourages those who are unsure whether a situation is controlled by this Policy to ask questions and seek advice through the Title IX Office or the Consultation Line, available at https://www.umaryland.edu/oac/consult-with-us/.\nIII. DEFINITIONS\nA. Actual Knowledge\nUMB will have actual knowledge that a violation of this Policy may have occurred when notice of the alleged violation is given to an Official with Authority to take corrective action. A report to the Title IX Coordinator or designee or received through UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Hotline is sufficient to provide UMB with actual knowledge.\nB. Advisor\nAdvisor means a person chosen by a party or appointed by the institution to accompany the party to meetings related to the resolution process, to advise the party on that process, and to conduct cross-examination for the party at the hearing, if any.\nC. Complainant\nAn individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that is in violation of this Policy.\nD. Confidential Employees\nEmployees of UMB who, in relation to the services being provided on behalf of the institution, have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential. A list of these individuals is listed in Section VI.C.4.\nE. Consent\nA knowing, voluntary, and affirmatively communicated willingness to mutually participate in a particular sexual activity or behavior.\xc2\xa0 Consent must be given by a person with the ability and capacity to exercise free will and make a rational and reasonable judgment. Consent may be expressed either by affirmative words or actions, as long as those words or actions create a mutually understandable permission regarding the conditions of sexual activity. Consent may be withdrawn at any time. Consent cannot be obtained by force, threat, coercion, fraud, manipulation, reasonable fear of injury, intimidation, or by using one\xe2\x80\x99s mental or physical helplessness or incapacity. Consent cannot be implied based on the mere fact of a previous consensual dating or sexual relationship. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another.\nIf a person is incapacitated, which is to be deprived of their capacity or natural power, they are not able to make rational decisions and, therefore, cannot consent to sexual activity. Incapacity will be evaluated using a reasonable person standard, e.g., would a reasonable person believe the person is/was unable to consent.\xc2\xa0 Incapacitation can be caused by the consumption of alcohol, but a person who is \xe2\x80\x9cdrunk\xe2\x80\x9d or intoxicated\xe2\x80\x9d may or may not be incapacitated; incapacitation can also be the result of being drugged, unconscious, sleep-deprived and/or ill.\nF. Dating Violence\nViolence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s statement, with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\nG. Domestic Violence\nA felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred; or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person\xe2\x80\x99s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Maryland or the jurisdiction in which the crime or violence occurred.\nH. Education Program or Activity\nIncludes locations, events, or circumstances over which UMB has or does exercise substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by UMB.\nI. Emergency Removal\nRemoval of a party from UMB\xe2\x80\x99s program or activity on an emergency basis, provided UMB has undertaken an individualized safety and risk analysis, determined that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual harassment justifies removal, and provided the respondent with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.\nJ. Formal Complaint\nA document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment by a Respondent and requesting that UMB investigate the allegation of sexual harassment. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator.\nK. Hearing Decision-maker\nDecision-maker refers to the individual(s) who have decision-making and sanctioning authority within UMB\xe2\x80\x99s formal grievance process.\nL. Hearing Panelist\nIndividuals who serve on hearing panels within UMB\xe2\x80\x99s formal grievance process.\nM. Investigator\nInvestigator means the person or persons charged by UMB with gathering facts about an alleged violation of this Policy, synthesizing the evidence, and compiling this information into an investigation report.\nN. Non-confidential Employees\nEmployees of UMB who do not have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential as listed in Section VI.C.4.\nO. Official with Authority\nAny official of UMB with authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the institution.\nP.

Respondent\nA person who has been accused of violating this Policy.\nR. Retaliation\nIntimidating, threatening, coercing, or discriminating against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, USM or UMB policy relating to Sexual Misconduct, or because an individual has made a report, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to Sexual Misconduct.

Supportive Measures\nSupportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the Complainant or the Respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed.

Concerns of bias or a potential conflict of interest by any other administrator involved in the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes should be raised with the Title IX Coordinator.\nThe Title IX Coordinator is responsible for receiving complaints or reports of conduct that could constitute sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managing the Title IX Program, including the informal and formal grievance processes, and ensuring effective implementation of any remedies determined through UMB\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process.\nReports of misconduct or discrimination committed by the Title IX Coordinator, or concerns regarding potential bias or conflict of interest by the Title IX Coordinator, should be made to UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Accountability Officer and Vice President, Dr. Susan Buskirk; or through the UMB Hotline.\nV. POLICY EXPECTATIONS\nA. Prohibitions Against Sex and Gender-based Discrimination\nUMB adheres to all federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination in public institutions of higher education. Specifically, Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in UMB programs and activities.\nUMB does not discriminate, or tolerate discrimination, against any employee, applicant for employment, student, or applicant for admission on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.\xc2\xa0 Sex and Gender-based Discrimination is prohibited.\nThis Policy includes Sex and Gender-based Discrimination in both employment and access to educational opportunities, and access to services and programs provided by UMB.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, any member of the UMB community who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational or employment access and/or opportunities of any member of the UMB community, guest, or visitor on the basis of sex or gender in violation of federal and state laws and regulations is in violation of this Policy. UMB's prohibitions on discrimination extend to its admissions and hiring processes. UMB will take steps to eliminate prohibited conduct, prevent its reoccurrence, and remedy its effects.\nB. Prohibition Against Sexual Misconduct\nUMB does not tolerate Sexual Misconduct of or by any employee, affiliate, volunteer, student, visitor, contractor, or guest. UMB will act to remedy all forms of Sexual Misconduct.\nUMB reserves the right to address offensive conduct and/or harassment not prohibited by this Policy, for example, harassment that does not rise to the level of creating a hostile environment, or is of a generic nature not based on sex or gender. Such conduct may be referred for alternative review and resolution by the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC) to other departments as appropriate, including to Human Resources Services (HRS) for human resource related violations and to Deans or their designees for student code of conduct violations.\nVI. REPORTING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT\nA. Reporting Policy Violations to UMB\nAny person may report Sexual Harassment (whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment).\n1. Employees\nAll UMB Non-Confidential Employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct which they believe may be a violation of this Policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority.\xc2\xa0 Failure of a Non-Confidential Employee to report an incident or incidents of Sexual Misconduct of which they become aware is a violation of this Policy and the violator could be subject to disciplinary action.\nNo employee (other than UMB Police) is authorized to investigate or resolve reports of prohibited conduct without the involvement of the Title IX Coordinator.\n2. Students\nAll UMB students are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.\n3. Third Parties\nThird Parties (e.g., contractors, visitors, etc.) are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.\nB. Privacy and Confidentiality\n1. UMB is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of information of all individuals involved in a Sexual Misconduct matter.\xc2\xa0 Privacy and confidentiality have distinct meanings under this Policy.\nPrivacy generally means that information related to a report of Sexual Misconduct will be shared only with those UMB employees with a \xe2\x80\x9cneed to know\xe2\x80\x9d the information in order to assist in the review, investigation, or resolution of the report.\xc2\xa0 Although not bound by confidentiality, these employees will make every effort to protect the privacy interests of all individuals, consistent with due process requirements and the need for a thorough review.\nConfidentiality means that the information shared with professionals who have been designated by UMB as confidential resources cannot be revealed to any other person without the express permission of the individual who shared the information with the professional.\xc2\xa0 These designated professionals are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.\n2. Reporting Party\xe2\x80\x99s Request for Confidentiality\nAn individual who wishes to discuss a Sexual Misconduct matter confidentially may do so by speaking with a professional who has a legal duty to maintain confidentiality.\xc2\xa0 Confidential resources for UMB students and employees are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.\xc2\xa0 Information shared with these resources will not be shared with anyone without the individual\xe2\x80\x99s express permission, unless maintaining such confidentiality would result in imminent physical harm to the individual or other individuals.\xc2\xa0 When a report involves suspected abuse of a minor, applicable laws and UMB policies require reporting to child protective services and/or local law enforcement.\n3. Reporting Party\xe2\x80\x99s Request for Privacy\nIf a Complainant or other reporting party does want their name to be shared, does not want an investigation to take place, or does not want a formal resolution to be pursued, they may make such a request to the Title IX Coordinator, who will evaluate the request along with various considerations, including risks to members of the UMB community and legal requirements. UMB will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with a request for privacy or a request not to pursue an investigation.\xc2\xa0 Where UMB is unable to take action consistent with the request of the Complainant or reporting party, the Title IX Coordinator will inform them about UMB\xe2\x80\x99s chosen course of action.\n4. Timely Warning\nIf a report of Sexual Misconduct discloses a serious or continuing threat to the UMB community, UMB may issue a campus-wide timely warning to protect the health or safety of the UMB community. The timely warning will not include identifying information about the reporting party.\nC. Options for Reporting\nReports of Sexual Misconduct may be made to UMB using any of the following options:\n1.

Medical attention is recommended even if more than five (5) days have passed since the assault occurred.\nMercy Medical Center Emergency Room345 St. Paul PlaceBaltimore, Maryland 21202410-332-9494https://bmoresafemercy.org/for-patients/\nUMB Title IX personnel are available to promptly assist anyone experiencing sex- or gender-based violence, including sexual assault, in obtaining medical attention, including providing transportation to the nearest designated SAFE hospital.\nInformation on Maryland SAFE programs located outside Baltimore City is included in Section XIV. Resources, below.\nVIII. AMNESTY\nUMB encourages the reporting of Sexual Misconduct by victims and witnesses.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, victims or witnesses are hesitant to report misconduct or participate in resolution processes because they fear that they themselves may be accused of policy violations.\xc2\xa0 It is in the best interest of the UMB community for victims and witnesses to report misconduct.\xc2\xa0 To encourage reporting, UMB offers amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.\nIf the behavior was a violation of the drug or alcohol policy, and UMB is not required by law to intervene or report, UMB will offer amnesty if the violation occurred reasonably during or near the time of the alleged Sexual Misconduct, the person reported or is cooperating with UMB\xe2\x80\x99s investigation in good faith, and the behavior did not put another individual\xe2\x80\x99s health or safety at risk.\nUMB encourages community members to assist victims during or after an incident when it is safe to do so, and offers training in bystander intervention.\xc2\xa0 For students who offer help to others in need, UMB pursues a policy of amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.\nIX. THE RESOLUTION PROCESS\nUpon receipt by the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority of an allegation or notice of an alleged violation of the Policy, UMB initiates its resolution process, which involves a prompt preliminary review to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe this Policy has been violated.\nThe Title IX Coordinator will initiate communication with the Complainant to offer Supportive Measures and determine if the Complainant wishes to file a Formal Complaint.\xc2\xa0 Upon receipt of a Formal Complaint, the parties will be provided with written notice of the allegations, UMB\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process, including formal and informal resolution processes, the right of an Advisor of the party\xe2\x80\x99s choice, and UMB\xe2\x80\x99s policies regarding knowingly making false statements or submitting false information.\nUMB will investigate allegations in a Formal Complaint.\xc2\xa0 Any allegations that do not constitute an allegation of Sexual Harassment as defined in Section III.W, did not occur in UMB\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, will be dismissed for purposes of a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment under Title IX; such a dismissal does not preclude UMB from taking action under this Policy, UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Code of Ethics and Conduct or other relevant policies.\nUMB\xe2\x80\x99s investigatory process assumes the responsibility to ensure that the burden of proof and the burden of gathering sufficient evidence to reach a determination is borne by UMB. During the investigation process, the parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses, including fact and expert witness, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.\xc2\xa0 Neither party will be restricted from discussing the allegations or gathering and presenting relevant evidence.\nTo the extent allegations fall within the scope of Title IX, at the conclusion of the investigation, adjudication of the allegations will occur through a live hearing.\xc2\xa0 During the hearing, as more fully described in the Procedures, each party, through their Advisor, will have the opportunity to question and cross-examine the other party and any witnesses.\xc2\xa0 Live hearings may be conducted with the parties located in separate rooms/locations with technology enabling the decision-maker(s), panelists, and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. For parties that do not have an advisor, UMB will provide an Advisor of its choice, who may or may not be an attorney, for the purposes of conducting such questioning and cross-examination. An audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of the live hearing will be made available to the parties for inspection and review.\xc2\xa0 A Determination will be made by the Decision-maker and a written Determination report will be provided to the parties simultaneously.\nTo the extent allegations fall partially within the scope of Title IX and partially within the scope of other policies, UMB may bifurcate matters.\nThe parties may appeal a Determination, or any dismissal of a Formal Complaint, on the following grounds:\nProcedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;\nNew evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal of the Formal Complaint was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; and\nThe Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.\nIn order to make a determination of whether or not a policy violation occurred, UMB uses the \xe2\x80\x9cpreponderance of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d standard, that is, whether it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred.\nThe investigation and subsequent resolution processes determine whether the Policy has been violated. If it is determined that a policy violation occurred, UMB will promptly implement effective remedies designed to end the discrimination, prevent its reoccurrence, and address its effects.\nUpon the freely given consent of both parties, an informal resolution process may be chosen in lieu of the formal process of investigation and adjudication.\xc2\xa0 For those parties that agree to an Informal Process, UMB will provide a written notice of the allegation, the requirements for participation in the Informal Resolution process, the right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution process at any time before a resolution is agreed upon, and the potential consequences that may result from participating in the Informal Resolution process. Where there is an allegation of Sexual Misconduct committed by an employee against a student, the Informal Resolution process will not be offered as an option.\nUMB prohibits the use of mediation to resolve policy violations where the Sexual Misconduct includes stalking, sexual assault, or sexual coercion.\nA. Advisors\nComplainants and Respondents may have an advisor of their choice attend with them all meetings and interviews within the resolution process, if they so choose.\nWhere a matter falls within the scope of Title IX such that a live hearing is required, Complainants and Respondents must have an advisor when a formal process is initiated and these advisors will be responsible for questioning witnesses during the live hearing of the grievance process. Each party may select whomever they wish for this role if the person(s) is eligible and available, i.e., is not a party or witness in the process and is not a minor. Examples of advisors include a licensed attorney, an advocate who is supervised by a licensed attorney, or a trained advocate. In addition, as necessary, a translator will be made available upon request of a party.\nThe advisor may attend meetings or interviews with the party.\xc2\xa0 The advisor must attend any hearings and will be required to conduct any cross-examination on behalf of the party they are advising.\xc2\xa0 The advisor may offer private consultations with the party during hearings, meetings, and interviews, except during questioning of the party.\xc2\xa0 Parties may request, through the Title IX Coordinator, to have more than one Advisor.\xc2\xa0 The decision to grant this request is at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and will be granted equitably to all parties.\nA current or former UMB student who makes a complaint or who responds to a complaint on which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and who was enrolled as a student at UMB at the time of the incident that is the basis of the complaint may obtain legal counsel through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (the \xe2\x80\x9cCommission\xe2\x80\x9d). The Commission has developed a list of attorneys and legal services programs willing to represent students on a pro bono basis or at reduced fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. The student may select an attorney on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s list or seek an alternate attorney to whom the Commission will pay reasonable fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs.\xc2\xa0 Any fees above and beyond those paid under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation are the responsibility of the student. The Commission will not pay attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for representation of a student in any criminal or civil matter or any administrative matter that is not a Title IX proceeding at an institution operating in Maryland. See https://mhec.maryland.gov/Pages/Title-IX-Campus-Sexual-Assault-Proceedings.aspx.\nB. Timeliness\nUMB will make a good faith effort to complete the resolution process, including any appeal, within a sixty (60) calendar day time period, which can be extended as necessary by the Title IX Coordinator, with notice to the parties.\nUMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to weeks) and resolution process if circumstances require. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the need for language assistance, the absence of parties and/or witnesses, and/or accommodation for disabilities or health conditions. UMB will communicate in writing the anticipated duration of the delay and reason to the parties and provide the parties with status updates if necessary. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process as soon as feasible. During such a delay, UMB will implement Supportive Measures as deemed appropriate. Institutional action(s) are not precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.\nC. Withdrawal or Resignation During Resolution Process\nStudents: Should a student decide not to participate in the process, the process will proceed to an appropriate resolution.\nShould a student Respondent permanently withdraw from the Institution, the process will end, as the Institution no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former student. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that have contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct. The student who withdraws or leaves while the process is pending may not return to UMB and a hold will be placed on their ability to be readmitted. If the student withdraws or takes leave for a specified period of time (e.g., one semester or term), the process will continue and that student will not be permitted to return to UMB unless and until the process is concluded and, where applicable, any sanctions have been satisfied. During the process, UMB may put a hold on a Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s transcript or place a note on a Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s transcript or dean\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary certification that a disciplinary matter is pending.\nEmployees: Should an employee Respondent resign from employment with unresolved allegations pending, the resolution process ends, as UMB no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former employee. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct.\nX. SUPPORTIVE MEASURES\nIndividuals involved in reported Sexual Misconduct may be entitled to Supportive Measures.\xc2\xa0 In some instances, Supportive Measures such as no-contact orders, may extend beyond the conclusion of informal or formal resolution of a complaint.\xc2\xa0 Supportive Measures are not sanctions.\nSupportive Measures, may include, but are not limited to, the following:\ncounseling\nnotification of the appropriate administrative authorities regarding possible absences from employment or academic program\nextensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments\narrangements for alternative academic, living, or employment situations, if such alternative is available and feasible\nmodifications to work or class schedules, building access points, parking lot assignments, and other similar logistics, including increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus\ndevelopment of a mutual no-contact order (or a no-trespass order against a non-affiliated third party)\nAny request(s) for Supportive Measures should be made to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact the appropriate UMB personnel to coordinate and implement Supportive Measures.\nXI. SANCTIONS\nSanctions may be imposed upon any member of the UMB community determined to have violated this Policy. The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:\nA. Student Remediations and Sanctions\nWarning\nProbation\nSuspension\nDismissal\nRequired Counseling\nRequired Training or Education\nWithholding Degree\nRevocation of Degree\nTranscript Notation\nOther Actions\nB. Employee Remediations and Sanctions\nWarning \xe2\x80\x93 Written or Verbal\nPerformance Improvement Plan\nRequired Counseling\nRequired Training or Education\nDemotion\nSuspension without Pay\nSuspension with Pay\nTermination\nOther Actions\nC. Sanctioning for Sexual Misconduct\nUMB considers Sexual Assault to be the most serious sexual misconduct.\xc2\xa0 Respondents found responsible for Sexual Assault violations typically receive the most severe sanctions, including suspension or dismissal for students and termination for employees. However, UMB reserves the right to impose any level of sanction, ranging from a reprimand up to and including suspension or expulsion/termination, for any act of Sexual Misconduct, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\nThe Hearing Decision-maker or Panel reserves the right to deviate from the range of recommended sanctions in the case of serious mitigating circumstances or egregiously offensive conduct. Neither the initial hearing officers nor any appeals body or officer will deviate from the range of recommended sanctions unless compelling justification exists to do so.\nRespondents are expected to comply with all assigned sanctions, responsive actions, and corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the Decision-maker and/or Title IX Coordinator. Failure to abide by the sanctions/actions imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanctions/actions, including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination, and may be noted on a student\xe2\x80\x99s official transcript or in an employee\xe2\x80\x99s official record. A suspension will be lifted only after compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.\nD. Prohibition on Retaliation\nRetaliation is any adverse action taken because of a person\xe2\x80\x99s participation in a protected activity. Protected activities include reporting an incident that may implicate this Policy, participating in the resolution process (as a party or witness), supporting a reporting party, Complainant or Respondent, or assisting in providing information relevant to an investigation. Protected activities also include opposing Sexual Misconduct, refusing to participate in wrongful or unlawful activities or refusing to carry out a directive that would include engaging in or hiding wrongful or unlawful activities.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Adverse actions are negative professional or educational actions, that would not otherwise have been taken, to deter an individual from engaging in, or in retaliation against an individual for participating in, protected activities.\xc2\xa0 Adverse actions are actions that would dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in the complaint process (either as a party or non-party witness).\nActs of alleged retaliation should be reported immediately using the UMB Hotline and will be promptly investigated as a potential separate violation of this Policy. UMB is prepared to take appropriate steps to prevent retaliation.\nXII. RECORDS\nRecords of all allegations, investigations, formal and informal resolutions, and hearings will be kept for at least seven (7) years by the Title IX Coordinator. The Institution will also retain records of the training provided to Title IX Coordinators, investigators, and decision-makers.\nXIII. PREVENTION AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS\nAnnually, UMB community members are expected to participate in training that addresses Title IX rights, responsibilities, and obligations, raises awareness regarding Sexual Misconduct, and seeks to prevent its occurrence. Information on mandatory training will be provided through the Title IX website.\nTraining for Students: UMB provides mandatory student training at the beginning of each academic year.\nTraining for Employees: UMB provides mandatory employee training upon hire and at the beginning of each academic year. Additional mandatory training may be required based on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s role within UMB.\nAdditionally, University Recreation and Fitness (URecFit), in collaboration with University Police, offers Rape Aggression Defense Training (RAD) on techniques for prevention and defense.\nRequests for additional training can be made through the Office of Accountability and Compliance, at www.umaryland.edu/oac.\nXIV.

Accountability and Compliance\n|\nApproved August 14, 2020\nPurpose\nTo describe how UMB will act on any formal or informal notice/complaint of violation of the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Policy\xe2\x80\x9d) that is received by the Title IX Coordinator or any other Official with Authority by applying these procedures, known as \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX Procedures\xe2\x80\x9d.\nApplicability\nThe procedures below apply only to Qualifying Allegations of sexual harassment that are subject to the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX) (including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking) involving students, staff, administrator, or faculty members.\nProcedure\n1. Overview\nUMB will act on any formal or informal notice/complaint of violation of the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Policy\xe2\x80\x9d) that is received by the Title IX Coordinator or any other Official with Authority by applying these procedures, known as \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX Procedures\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe procedures below apply only to Qualifying Allegations of sexual harassment that are subject to the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX) (including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking) involving students, staff, administrator, or faculty members.\nAllegations of Prohibited Sexual Misconduct that violate the Policy that do not fall under the scope of Title IX are not Qualifying Allegations and will be resolved following UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Non-Title IX Procedures).\xc2\xa0 The UMB Title IX Coordinator is responsible for determining if an allegation is a Qualifying Allegation.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0An allegation pertaining to Sexual Misconduct that occurred outside the United States and an allegation pertaining to Sexual Misconduct that does not satisfy the definition of Sexual Harassment under Title IX are not Qualifying Allegations.\nThe procedures below may be used to resolve non-sexual misconduct violations of UMB policy if the collateral misconduct arises from the investigation of or occurring in conjunction with the alleged discriminatory sexual conduct. Other allegations of misconduct, unrelated to sexual misconduct allegations covered by the UMB Policy will be addressed through other appropriate UMB procedures. \xc2\xa0This procedure incorporates by reference the definitions in the UMB Policy.\n2. Notice/Complaint\nUpon the Title IX Coordinator\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of a complaint or notice alleging violation of the UMB Policy, the Title IX Coordinator will initiate a prompt Initial Assessment to determine the next steps UMB will take.\nIf a Complainant does not wish to disclose their personally identifiable information (i.e. wishes to remain anonymous) and/or does not wish to proceed, the Complainant may make such a request to the Title IX Coordinator. Regardless of their choice, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will offer Supportive Measures to the Complainant as appropriate.\n3. Initial Assessment\nFollowing receipt of notice or a complaint of an alleged violation of the Policy, the Title IX Coordinator engages in an initial assessment, typically within one to five business days. The steps in an initial assessment can include:\nIf notice is given, the Title IX Coordinator seeks to determine if the person impacted wishes to make a Formal Complaint, and will assist them to do so, if desired.\nIf they do not wish to do so, the Title IX Coordinator determines whether to initiate a complaint because a violence risk assessment indicates a compelling threat to health and/or safety.\nIf a Formal Complaint is received, the Title IX Coordinator assesses its sufficiency and works with the Complainant to make sure it is correctly completed.\nThe Title IX Coordinator reaches out to the Complainant to offer supportive measures.\nThe Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to ensure they are aware of the right to have an Advisor.\nThe Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to determine whether the Complainant prefers a supportive and remedial response, an informal resolution option, or a formal investigation and grievance process.\nIf a supportive and remedial response is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to identify their wishes, assesses the request, and implements accordingly. No Formal Grievance Process is initiated, though the Complainant can elect to initiate one later, if desired.\nIf an informal resolution option is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator assesses whether the complaint is suitable for informal resolution, and may seek to determine if the Respondent is also willing to engage in informal resolution. Either party may terminate the informal resolution process and proceed through the formal grievance process at any time up until an agreement is entered.\nIf a Formal Grievance Process is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator determines if the misconduct alleged falls within the scope of Title IX,\nThe alleged conduct would constitute Sexual Harassment within an Education Program or Activity against a person in the United States if substantiated; and\nThe Complainant is participating or attempting to participate in an Education Program or Activity, including the admissions or hiring process, at the time the Complainant files a Formal Complaint.\nIf it does, the Title IX Coordinator will initiate the formal investigation and grievance process under the Title IX Procedures, directing the investigation to address:\nan incident, and/or\na pattern of alleged misconduct, and/or\na culture/climate issue, based on the nature of the complaint.\nIf it does not, the Title IX Coordinator determines that Title IX does not apply (and will \xe2\x80\x9cdismiss\xe2\x80\x9d that aspect of the complaint, if any), assesses which policies may apply and refers the matter for resolution under Non-Title IX Procedures or other relevant resolution process.\nPlease note that dismissing a complaint under Title IX is solely a procedural requirement under Title IX, and does not limit UMB\xe2\x80\x99s authority to address a complaint with an appropriate process and remedies.\nAt the discretion of the Title IX Officer or designee, multiple reports may be consolidated into one Informal Resolution and/or investigation if the information related to each incident is relevant in reaching a resolution. Matters may be consolidated where the matters involve multiple Complainants, multiple Respondents, or related facts and circumstances involving the same Parties, including those arising out of the same or different events(s).\na. Violence Risk Assessment\nIn many cases, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that a Violence Risk Assessment (VRA) should be conducted by the UMB Behavioral Awareness and Threat Assessment (BETA) team as part of the initial assessment. A VRA can aid in ten critical and/or required determinations, including:\nEmergency removal of a Respondent on the basis of immediate threat to physical health/safety;\nWhether the Title IX Coordinator should pursue/sign a Formal Complaint absent a willing/able Complainant;\nWhether to put the investigation on the footing of incident and/or pattern and/or climate;\nTo help identify potential predatory conduct;\nTo help assess/identify grooming behaviors;\nWhether it is reasonable to try to resolve a complaint through Informal Resolution, and what modality may be most successful;\nWhether to permit a voluntary withdrawal by the Respondent;\nWhether to impose transcript notation or communicate with a transfer about a Respondent;\nAssessment of appropriate sanctions/remedies (to be applied post-hearing); and/or\nWhether a Clery Act Timely Warning/Trespass order/Persona-non-grata is needed.\nThreat assessment is the process of evaluating the actionability of violence by an individual against another person or group following the issuance of a direct or conditional threat. A VRA is a broader term used to assess any potential violence or danger, regardless of the presence of a vague, conditional, or direct threat.\nA VRA authorized by the Title IX Coordinator should occur in collaboration with the UMB BETA team. Where a VRA is required by the Title IX Coordinator, a Respondent refusing to cooperate may result in a charge of failure to comply within the appropriate student or employee conduct process.\nA VRA is not an evaluation for an involuntary behavioral health hospitalization (e.g., 5150 in California, Section XII in Massachusetts, Baker Act in Florida), nor is it a psychological or mental health assessment. A VRA assesses the risk of actionable violence, often with a focus on targeted/predatory escalations, and is supported by research from the fields of law enforcement, criminology, human resources, and psychology.\nUMB\xe2\x80\x99s Policy XI-3.00(A) UMB Behavioral Evaluation and Threat Assessment Policy can be found here.\nb. Dismissal (Mandatory and Discretionary)\nUMB must dismiss a Formal Complaint or any allegations therein if under the Title IX Procedures, at any time during the investigation or hearing, it is determined that:\n1) The conduct alleged in the formal complaint would not constitute sexual harassment as defined in UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Policy on Sexual Misconduct, even if proved; and/or\n2) The conduct did not occur in an educational program or activity controlled by the UMB (including buildings or property controlled by recognized student organizations), and/or UMB does not have control of the Respondent; and/or\n3)\xc2\xa0The conduct did not occur against a person in the United States; and/or\n4) At the time of filing a formal complaint, a Complainant is not participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity of the UMB.\nUMB may dismiss a formal complaint or any allegations therein if, at any time during the investigation or hearing:\n1) A Complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the Complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein; or\n2) The Respondent is no longer enrolled in or employed by UMB; or\n3) Specific circumstances prevent UMB from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.\nUpon any dismissal, UMB will promptly send written notice of the dismissal and the rationale for doing so simultaneously to the parties. \xc2\xa0The written notice of dismissal will also include, if the Formal Complaint was dismissed due to falling outside the scope of Title IX, if the allegations will be addressed using Non-Title IX Procedures.\xc2\xa0 For complaints that will addressed using Non-Title IX Procedures, Alleged Violations of the Policy on Sexual Misconduct: Non-Title IX Procedures (\xe2\x80\x9cNon-Title IX Procedures\xe2\x80\x9d).\nThis dismissal decision is appealable by any party under the procedures for appeal below. \xc2\xa0A Complainant who decides to withdraw a complaint may later request to reinstate it or refile it.\n4. Counterclaims\nUMB is obligated to ensure that the grievance process is not abused for retaliatory purposes. UMB permits the filing of counterclaims but uses an initial assessment, described above, to assess whether the allegations in the counterclaim are made in good faith. Counterclaims by a Respondent may be made in good faith, but are, on occasion, made for purposes of retaliation, instead. Counterclaims made with retaliatory intent will not be permitted.\nCounterclaims determined to have been reported in good faith will be processed using the grievance procedures below. Investigation of such claims may take place after resolution of the underlying initial allegation, in which case a delay may occur.\nCounterclaims may also be resolved through the same investigation as the underlying allegation, at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator. When counterclaims are not made in good faith, they will be considered retaliatory and may constitute a violation of this policy.\n5. Right to an Advisor\nThe parties may each have an Advisor of their choice present with them for all meetings, interviews, and hearings within the resolution process, if they so choose. The parties may select whoever they wish to serve as their Advisor as long as the Advisor is eligible and available.\nChoosing an Advisor who is also a witness in the process creates potential for bias and conflict-of-interest. A party who chooses an Advisor who is also a witness can anticipate that issues of potential bias will be explored by the hearing Decision-maker(s).\nUMB may permit parties to have more than one Advisor upon request to the Title IX Coordinator. The decision to grant this request is at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and will be granted equitably to all parties.\nAs a public entity, UMB fully respects and accords the Weingarten rights of employees. For parties who are entitled to union representation, UMB will allow the unionized employee to have their union representative (if requested by the party) as well as an Advisor of their choice present for all resolution-related meetings and interviews. To uphold the principles of equity, the other party (regardless of union membership) will also be permitted to have two Advisors. Witnesses are not permitted to have union representation or Advisors in grievance process interviews or meetings.\na. Who Can Serve as an Advisor\nThe Advisor may be a friend, mentor, family member, attorney, or any other individual a party chooses to advise, support, and/or consult with them throughout the resolution process. The parties may choose Advisors from inside or outside of the UMB community.\nThe Title IX Coordinator will also offer to assign a trained Advisor for any party if the party so chooses. If the parties choose an Advisor from the pool available from UMB, the Advisor will be trained by UMB and be familiar with UMB\xe2\x80\x99s resolution process.\nIf the parties choose an Advisor from outside the pool of those identified by UMB, the Advisor may not have been trained by UMB and may not be familiar with UMB policies and procedures.\nParties also have the right to choose not to have an Advisor in the initial stages of the resolution process, prior to a hearing.\nb. Pre-Interview Meetings\nAdvisors may request to meet with the administrative officials conducting interviews/meetings in advance of these interviews or meetings. This pre-meeting allows Advisors to clarify and understand their role and UMB\xe2\x80\x99s policies and procedures.\nc. Advisor\xe2\x80\x99s Role in Meetings and Interviews\nThe parties may be accompanied by their Advisor in all meetings and interviews at which the party is entitled to be present, including intake and interviews. Advisors should help the parties prepare for each meeting and are expected to advise ethically, with integrity, and in good faith.\nUMB cannot guarantee equal Advisory rights, meaning that if one party selects an Advisor who is an attorney, but the other party does not or cannot afford an attorney, UMB is not obligated to provide an attorney.\nd. Advisors in Hearings/UMB-Appointed Advisor\nUnder U.S. Department of Education regulations under Title IX, a form of indirect questioning is required during the hearing, but must be conducted by the parties\xe2\x80\x99 Advisors. The parties are not permitted to directly question each other or any witnesses. If a party does not have an Advisor for a hearing, UMB will appoint a trained Advisor for the limited purpose of conducting any questioning of the other party and witnesses.\nA party may reject this appointment and choose their own Advisor, but they may not proceed without an Advisor. If the party\xe2\x80\x99s Advisor will not conduct questioning, UMB will appoint an Advisor who will do so thoroughly, regardless of the participation or non-participation of the advised party in the hearing itself. Extensive questioning of the parties and witnesses will also be conducted by the Decision-maker(s) during the hearing.\ne. Advisor Violations of UMB Policy\nAll Advisors are subject to the same UMB policies and procedures, whether they are attorneys or not. Advisors are expected to advise their advisees without disrupting proceedings. Advisors may not address UMB officials in a meeting or interview unless invited to (e.g., asking procedural questions). The Advisor may not make a presentation or represent their advisee during any meeting or proceeding and may not speak on behalf of the advisee to the Investigator(s) or other Decision-maker(s) except during a hearing proceeding, during cross-examination.\nThe parties are expected to ask and respond to questions on their own behalf throughout the investigation phase of the resolution process. Although the Advisor generally may not speak on behalf of their advisee, the Advisor may consult with their advisee, either privately as needed, or by conferring or passing notes during any resolution process meeting or interview. For longer or more involved discussions, the parties and their Advisors may ask for breaks to allow for private consultation.\nAny Advisor who oversteps their role as defined by this policy will be warned only once. If the Advisor continues to disrupt or otherwise fails to respect the limits of the Advisor role, the meeting will be ended, or other appropriate measures implemented. Subsequently, the Title IX Coordinator will determine how to address the Advisor\xe2\x80\x99s non-compliance and future role.\nf. Sharing Information with the Advisor\nUMB expects that the parties may wish to have UMB share documentation and evidence related to the allegations with their Advisors. Parties may share this information directly with their Advisor or other individuals if they wish. Doing so may help the parties participate more meaningfully in the resolution process.\nUMB provides a consent form that authorizes UMB to share such information directly with their Advisor. The parties must complete and submit this form to the Title IX Coordinator before UMB is able to share records with an Advisor.\nIf a party requests that all communication be made through their attorney Advisor, UMB will not comply with that request. It is the responsibility of the parties to provide information to their Advisor, including communications.\ng. Privacy of Records Shared with Advisor\nAdvisors are expected to maintain the privacy of the records shared with them. These records may not be shared with third parties, disclosed publicly, or used for purposes not explicitly authorized by UMB. UMB may seek to restrict the role of any Advisor who does not respect the sensitive nature of the process or who fails to abide by UMB\xe2\x80\x99s privacy expectations.\nh. Expectations of an Advisor\nUMB generally expects an Advisor to adjust their schedule to allow them to attend meetings when planned, but may change scheduled meetings to accommodate an Advisor\xe2\x80\x99s inability to attend, if doing so does not cause an unreasonable delay.\nUMB may also make reasonable provisions to allow an Advisor who cannot attend in person to attend a meeting by telephone, video conferencing, or other similar technologies as may be convenient and available.\ni. Expectations of the Parties with Respect to Advisors\nA party may elect to change Advisors during the process and is not obligated to use the same Advisor throughout. The parties are expected to inform the Investigator(s) of the identity of their Advisor at least two (2) business days before the date of their first meeting with Investigators (or as soon as possible if a more expeditious meeting is necessary or desired).\nThe parties are expected to provide timely notice to the Title IX Coordinator if they change Advisors at any time. It is assumed that if a party changes Advisors, consent to share information with the previous Advisor is terminated, and a release for the new Advisor must be secured. Parties are expected to inform the Title IX Coordinator of the identity of their hearing Advisor at least two (2) business days before the hearing.\nj. Assistance in Securing an Advisor\nUMB provides an Advisor to either Party for the specific purpose of conducting cross-examination if the Party has not chosen an Advisor.\xc2\xa0 Advisors may be chosen from the UMB Community. UMB does not guarantee an Advisor will have legal knowledge or expertise.\nFor representation, Respondents may wish to contact organizations such as:\nFACE (http://www.facecampusequality.org)\nSAVE (http://www.saveservices.org).\nComplainants may wish to contact organizations such as:\nThe Victim Rights Law Center (http://www.victimrights.org)\nThe National Center for Victims of Crime (http://www.victimsofcrime.org), which maintains the Crime Victim\xe2\x80\x99s Bar Association.\nThe Time\xe2\x80\x99s Up Legal Defense Fund: https://nwlc.org/times-up-legal-defense-fund/\nk. Legal Representation Fund for Title IX Proceedings (Students Only)\nA current or former UMB student who makes a complaint or who responds to a complaint on which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and who was enrolled as a student at UMB at the time of the incident that is the basis of the complaint may obtain legal counsel through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (the \xe2\x80\x9cCommission\xe2\x80\x9d). The Commission has developed a list of attorneys and legal services programs willing to represent students on a pro bono basis or at reduced fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. The student may select an attorney on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s list or seek an alternate attorney to whom the Commission will pay reasonable fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs.\xc2\xa0 Any fees above and beyond those paid under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation are the responsibility of the student. The Commission will not pay attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for representation of a student in any criminal or civil matter or any administrative matter that is not a Title IX proceeding at an institution operating in Maryland. See https://mhec.maryland.gov/Pages/Title-IX-Campus-Sexual-Assault-Proceedings.aspx.\n6.\xc2\xa0Resolution Processes\nResolution proceedings are private. All persons present at any time during the resolution process are expected to maintain the privacy of the proceedings in accordance with UMB\xe2\x80\x99s policy. Although there is an expectation of privacy around what Investigators share with parties during interviews, the parties have discretion to share their own knowledge and evidence with others if they so choose, with the exception of information the parties agree not to disclose related to Informal Resolution, discussed below. UMB encourages parties to discuss any sharing of information with their Advisors before doing so.\na. Informal Resolution\nInformal Resolution can include three different approaches:\nWhen the Title IX Coordinator can resolve the matter informally by providing supportive measures (only) to remedy the situation.\nWhen the parties agree to resolve the matter through an alternate resolution mechanism as described below, usually before a formal investigation takes place; see discussion in b., below.\nWhen the Respondent accepts responsibility for violating policy, and desires to accept a sanction and end the resolution process (similar to above, but usually occurs post-investigation); see discussion in c., below.\nTo initiate Informal Resolution, a Complainant needs to submit a Formal Complaint.\xc2\xa0 A Respondent who wishes to initiate Informal Resolution should contact the Title IX Coordinator.\nIt is not necessary to pursue Informal Resolution first in order to pursue a Formal Grievance Process, and any party participating in Informal Resolution can stop the process at any time and begin or resume the Formal Grievance Process.\nPrior to implementing Informal Resolution, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will provide the parties with written notice on behalf of UMB of the reported misconduct and any sanctions or measures that may result from participating in such a process, including information regarding any records that will be maintained or shared by UMB.\nUMB will obtain voluntary, written confirmation that all parties wish to resolve the matter through Informal Resolution before proceeding and will not pressure the parties to participate in Informal Resolution. Upon conclusion of the Informal Resolution, the parties will be provided a written copy of the terms of resolution agreement.\nb. Alternate Resolution Mechanism\nAlternate Resolution is an informal mechanism by which the parties reach a mutually agreed upon resolution of an allegation. All parties must consent to the use of an Alternate Resolution n\nThe Title IX Coordinator may look to the following factors to assess whether Alternate Resolution is appropriate, or which form of Alternate Resolution may be most successful for the parties:\nThe parties\xe2\x80\x99 amenability to Alternate Resolution;\nLikelihood of potential resolution, taking into account any power dynamics between the parties;\nThe parties\xe2\x80\x99 motivation to participate;\nCivility of the parties;\nResults of a violence risk assessment/ongoing risk analysis;\nDisciplinary history;\nWhether an emergency removal is needed;\nSkill of the Alternate Resolution facilitator with this type of allegation;\nComplaint complexity;\nEmotional investment/capability of the parties;\nRationality of the parties;\nGoals of the parties;\nAdequate resources to invest in Alternate Resolution (time, staff, etc.)\nThe ultimate determination of whether Alternate Resolution is available or successful is to be made by the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator maintains records of any resolution that is reached, and failure to abide by the resolution agreement may result in appropriate remedial/disciplinary actions. Results of complaints resolved by Informal Resolution or Alternate Resolution are not appealable.\nc. Respondent Accepts Responsibility for Alleged Violations\nThe Respondent may accept responsibility for all or part of the alleged policy violations at any point during the resolution process. If the Respondent indicates an intent to accept responsibility for all of the alleged misconduct, the formal process will be paused, and the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether Informal Resolution can be used according to the criteria above.\nIf Informal Resolution is applicable, the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether all parties and UMB are able to agree on responsibility, sanctions, and/or remedies. If so, the Title IX Coordinator implements the accepted finding that the Respondent is in violation of UMB policy and implements agreed-upon sanctions and/or remedies, in coordination with other appropriate administrator(s), as necessary.\nThis result is not subject to appeal once all parties indicate their written assent to all agreed upon terms of resolution. When the parties cannot agree on all terms of resolution, the Formal Grievance Process will resume at the same point where it was paused.\nWhen a resolution is accomplished, the appropriate sanction or remedial actions are promptly implemented in order to effectively stop the harassment or discrimination, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the effects of the discriminatory conduct, both on the Complainant and the community.\nd. Negotiated Resolution\nThe Title IX Coordinator, with the consent of the parties, may negotiate and implement an agreement to resolve the allegations that satisfies all parties and UMB. Negotiated Resolutions are not appealable.\n7. Grievance Process Pool\nThe Formal Grievance Process relies on a pool of administrators (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Pool\xe2\x80\x9d) to carry out the process.\na. Pool Member Roles\nMembers of the Pool are trained annually, and can serve in in the following roles, based on the training received and at the direction of the Title IX Coordinator:\nTo provide appropriate intake of and initial guidance pertaining to complaints\nTo act as an Advisor to the parties\nTo serve in a facilitation role in Informal Resolution process\nTo perform or assist with initial assessment\nTo investigate complaints\nTo serve as a hearing facilitator (process administrator, no decision-making role)\nTo serve as a Decision-maker regarding the complaint\nTo serve as a hearing Panelist\nTo serve as an Appeal Decision-maker\nb. Pool Member Appointment\nThe Chief Accountability Officer, who may consult with the Title IX Coordinator or other relevant parties, appoints the Pool, which acts with independence and impartiality. Some members of the Pool may be trained in a variety of skill sets and can rotate amongst the different roles listed above in different cases.\xc2\xa0 Some members of the Pool will have permanent roles. This process of role assignment may be the result of particular training, skills, aptitudes, or talents identified that make them best suited to particular roles.\nc. Pool Member Training\nThe Pool members receive annual training. Training will be specific to the roles the Pool member may hold and may include, but is not limited to:\nThe scope of the UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Discrimination and Harassment Policy and Procedures\nHow to conduct investigations and hearings that protect the safety of Complainants and Respondents, and promote accountability\nImplicit bias\nDisparate treatment and impact\nReporting, confidentiality, and privacy requirements\nApplicable laws, regulations, and federal regulatory guidance\nHow to implement appropriate and situation-specific remedies\nHow to investigate in a thorough, reliable, and impartial manner\nHow to uphold fairness, equity, and due process\nHow to weigh evidence\nHow to conduct questioning\nHow to assess credibility\nImpartiality and objectivity\nHow to render findings and generate clear, concise, evidence-based rationales\nThe definitions of all offenses\nHow to apply definitions used by UMB with respect to consent (or the absence or negation of consent) consistently, impartially, and in accordance with policy\nHow to conduct an investigation and grievance process including hearings, appeals, and informal resolution processes\nHow to serve impartially by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias\nAny technology to be used at a live hearing\nIssues of relevance of questions and evidence\nIssues of relevance to create an investigation report that fairly summarizes relevant evidence\nHow to determine appropriate sanctions in reference to all forms of harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation allegations\nRecordkeeping\nNot all members of the Pool will receive training in skills applicable to roles they will not serve.\nSpecific training is also provided for Appeal Decision-makers, intake personnel, Advisors (who are UMB employees), and Chairs. All Pool members are required to attend trainings related to their roles annually. The materials used to train all members of the Pool are publicly posted here: www.umaryland.edu/titleix/training.\nd. Pool Membership\nThe Pool includes:\nmembers of the Title IX team\nrepresentative(s) from each of the Schools to serve as Hearing Panelists\nSenior administration personnel\nIndividuals who are interested in serving in the Pool are encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator.\n8. Formal Grievance Process: Notice of Investigation and Allegations\nThe Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice of the investigation and allegations (the \xe2\x80\x9cNOIA\xe2\x80\x9d) to the Respondent upon commencement of the Formal Grievance Process. This facilitates the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prepare for the interview and to identify and choose an Advisor to accompany them. The NOIA is also copied to the Complainant, who is to be given advance notice of when the NOIA will be delivered to the Respondent.\nThe NOIA will include:\nA meaningful summary of all of allegations,\nThe identity of the involved parties (if known),\nThe precise misconduct being alleged,\nThe date and location of the alleged incident(s) (if known),\nThe specific policies implicated,\nA description of the applicable procedures,\nA statement of the potential sanctions/remedial actions that could result,\nA statement that UMB presumes the Respondent is not responsible for the reported misconduct unless and until the evidence supports a different determination,\nA statement that determinations of responsibility are made at the conclusion of the process and that the parties will be given an opportunity to inspect and review all directly related and/or relevant evidence obtained during the review and comment period,\nA statement about the UMB\xe2\x80\x99s policy on retaliation,\nInformation about the privacy of the process,\nInformation on the need for each party to have an Advisor of their choosing and suggestions for ways to identify an Advisor,\nA statement informing the parties that UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Policy prohibits knowingly making false statements, including knowingly submitting false information during the resolution process,\nDetail on how the party may request disability accommodations during the interview process,\nA link to or physical copy of the UMB\xe2\x80\x99s VAWA Brochure\nThe name(s) of the Investigator(s), along with a process to identify, in advance of the interview process, to the Title IX Coordinator any conflict of interest that the Investigator(s) may have, and\nAn instruction to preserve any evidence that is directly related to the allegations.\nAmendments and updates to the NOIA may be made as the investigation progresses and more information becomes available regarding the addition or dismissal of various charges.\nNotice will be made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the local or permanent address(es) of the parties as indicated in official UMB records, or emailed to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 UMB-issued email or designated accounts. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered.\n9. Resolution Timeline\nUMB will make a good faith effort to complete the resolution process within a sixty (60) business day time period, including appeal, which can be extended as necessary for appropriate cause by the Title IX Coordinator, who will provide notice and rationale for any extensions or delays to the parties as appropriate, as well as a estimate of how much additional time will be needed to complete the process.\n10. Appointment of Investigators\nOnce the decision to commence a formal investigation is made, the Title IX Coordinator appoints a Pool member, or members, to conduct the investigation, usually within two (2) business days of determining that an investigation should proceed.\n11. Ensuring Impartiality\nAny individual, including the Title IX Coordinator, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Investigator, Decision-maker(s), and Hearing Panelists, materially involved in the administration of the resolution process may neither have nor demonstrate a conflict of interest or bias for a party generally, or for a specific Complainant or Respondent.\nThe Title IX Coordinator will vet the assigned Investigator(s) to ensure impartiality by ensuring there are no actual or apparent conflicts of interest or disqualifying biases. The parties may, at any time during the resolution process, raise a concern regarding bias or conflict of interest, and the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether the concern is reasonable and supportable. If so, another Pool member will be assigned and the impact of the bias or conflict, if any, will be remedied. If the source of the conflict of interest or bias is the Title IX Coordinator, concerns should be raised with the Chief Accountability Officer.\nThe Formal Grievance Process involves an objective evaluation of all relevant evidence obtained, including evidence that supports that the Respondent engaged in a policy violation and evidence that supports that the Respondent did not engage in a policy violation. Credibility determinations may not be based solely on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s status or participation as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness.\nUMB is committed to due process.\xc2\xa0 It operates with the presumption that the Respondent is not responsible for the reported misconduct unless and until the Respondent is determined to be responsible for a policy violation by a preponderance of the evidence.\n12. Investigation Timeline\nInvestigations are completed expeditiously, normally within thirty (30) business days, though some investigations may take weeks or even months, depending on the nature, extent, and complexity of the allegations, availability of witnesses, police involvement, etc.\nUMB will make a good faith effort to complete investigations as promptly as circumstances permit and will communicate regularly with the parties to update them on the progress and timing of the investigation.\n13. Delays in the Investigation Process and Interactions with Law Enforcement\nUMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to a few weeks) if circumstances require. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to: a request from law enforcement to temporarily delay the investigation, the need for language assistance, the absence of parties and/or witnesses, and/or accommodations for disabilities or health conditions.\nUMB will communicate in writing the anticipated duration of the delay and reason to the parties, and provide the parties with status updates if necessary. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process as soon as feasible. During such a delay, UMB will implement supportive measures as deemed appropriate.\nUMB\xe2\x80\x99s action(s) or processes are not typically altered or precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.\n14. Steps in the Investigation Process\nAll investigations are thorough, reliable, impartial, prompt, and fair. Investigations involve interviews with all relevant parties and witnesses; obtaining available, relevant evidence; and identifying sources of expert information, as necessary.\nAll parties have a full and fair opportunity, through the investigation process, to suggest witnesses and questions, to provide evidence and expert witnesses, and to fully review and respond to all evidence on the record.\nThe Investigator(s) typically take(s) the following steps, if not already completed (not necessarily in this order):\nDetermine the identity and contact information of the Complainant\nIn coordination with campus partners (e.g., the Title IX Coordinator), initiate or assist with any necessary supportive measures\nIdentify all policies implicated by the alleged misconduct and notify the Complainant and Respondent of all of the specific policies implicated\nAssist the Title IX Coordinator with conducting a prompt initial assessment to determine if the allegations indicate a potential policy violation\nCommence a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation by identifying issues and developing a strategic investigation plan, including a witness list, evidence list, intended investigation timeframe, and order of interviews for all witnesses and the parties\nMeet with the Complainant to finalize their interview/statement, if necessary\nPrepare and send the initial Notice of Investigation and Allegation (NOIA). The NOIA may be amended with any additional or dismissed allegations\nThe NOIA will include:\na. The University\xe2\x80\x99s complete Policy and Procedures as set forth herein;\nb. The allegations of Prohibited Conduct as defined by the Policy;\nc. Identities of the Parties involved, if known;\nd. Date(s), location(s), and time(s) of the alleged incident(s), if known;\ne. Statement that the Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the adjudication process;\nf. Parties may have an Advisor of their choice, who may be an attorney and who may inspect and review evidence;\ng. If Parties do not select an Advisor of their choice, the University will provide a trained Advisor for purposes of performing cross-examination on behalf of that Party at the Hearing;\nh. Parties may have a Support Person of their choice;\ni. Advisement that knowingly making false statements or knowingly submitting false information during the investigation and adjudication process is prohibited under Section XII of the Policy;\nj. If the University decides to investigate additional allegations about either Party that are not in the original notice, the Parties will receive an amended notice containing the additional allegations; and\nk. The range of potential Sanctions associated with the alleged Prohibited Conduct.\nProvide each interviewed party and witness an opportunity to review and verify the Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s summary notes (or transcript) of the relevant evidence/testimony from their respective interviews and meetings\nMake good faith efforts to notify the parties of any meeting or interview involving the other party, in advance when possible\nWhen participation of a party is expected, provide that party with written notice of the date, time, and location of the meeting, as well as the expected participants and purpose\nInterview all available, relevant witnesses and conduct follow-up interviews as necessary\nAllow each party the opportunity to suggest witnesses and questions they wish the Investigator(s) to ask of the other party and witnesses, and document in the report which questions were asked, with a rationale for any changes or omissions\nComplete the investigation promptly and without unreasonable deviation from the intended timeline\nProvide regular status updates to the parties throughout the investigation\nPrior to the conclusion of the investigation, provide the parties and their respective Advisors (if so desired by the parties) with a list of witnesses whose information will be used to render a finding\nWrite a comprehensive investigation report fully summarizing the investigation, all witness interviews, and addressing all relevant evidence. Appendices including relevant physical or documentary evidence will be included\nThe Investigator(s) gather, assess, and synthesize evidence, but make no conclusions, engage in no policy analysis, and render no recommendations as part of their report\nPrior to the conclusion of the investigation, provide the parties and their respective Advisors (if a consent form has been properly completed and so desired by the parties) a secured electronic or hard copy of the draft investigation report as well as an opportunity to inspect and review all of the evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the reported misconduct, including evidence upon which UMB does not intend to rely in reaching a determination, for a ten (10) business day review and comment period so that each party may meaningfully respond to the evidence. The parties may elect to waive the full ten days. Each copy of the materials shared will be watermarked on each page with the role of the person receiving it (e.g., Complainant, Respondent, Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s Advisor, Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Advisor).\nThe Investigator(s) may elect to respond in writing in the investigation report to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submitted responses and/or to share the responses between the parties for additional responses\nThe Investigator(s) will incorporate relevant elements of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 written responses into the final investigation report, include any additional relevant evidence, make any necessary revisions, and finalize the report. The Investigator(s) should document all rationales for any changes made after the review and comment period\nThe Investigator(s) shares the report with the Title IX Coordinator and/or legal counsel for their review\nThe Investigator will incorporate any relevant feedback, and the final report is then shared with all parties and, if the proper Consent forms are completed, their Advisors through secure electronic transmission or hard copy at least ten (10) business days prior to a hearing. The parties are also provided with a file of any directly related evidence that was not included in the report.\n15. Role and Participation of Witnesses in the Investigation\nWitnesses (as distinguished from the parties) who are employees of UMB are required to cooperate with and participate in UMB\xe2\x80\x99s investigation and resolution process. Failure of such witnesses to cooperate with and/or participate in the investigation or resolution process constitutes a violation of policy and may warrant discipline.\nAlthough in-person interviews for parties and all potential witnesses are ideal, circumstances (e.g., study abroad, summer break) may require individuals to be interviewed remotely. Skype, Zoom, FaceTime, WebEx, or similar technologies may be used for interviews if the Investigator(s) determine that timeliness or efficiency dictate a need for remote interviewing. UMB will take appropriate steps to reasonably ensure the security/privacy of remote interviews.\nWitnesses may also provide written statements in lieu of interviews or choose to respond to written questions, if deemed appropriate by the Investigator(s), though not preferred. If a witness submits a written statement but does not intend to be and is not present for cross examination at a hearing, their written statement may not be used as evidence.\n16. Recording of Interviews\nNo unauthorized audio or video recording of any kind is permitted during investigation meetings. If Investigator(s) elect to audio and/or video record interviews, all involved parties must be made aware of and consent to audio and/or video recording.\n17. Evidentiary Considerations in the Investigation\nThe investigation does not consider: 1) incidents not directly related to the possible violation, unless they evidence a pattern; 2) the character of the parties; or 3) questions and evidence about the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent.\n18. Referral for Hearing\nProvided that the complaint is not resolved through Informal Resolution, once the final investigation report is shared with the parties, the Title IX Coordinator will refer the matter for a hearing.\nThe hearing cannot be less than ten (10) business days from the conclusion of the investigation \xe2\x80\x93when the final investigation report is transmitted to the parties and the Decision-maker\xe2\x80\x93unless all parties and the Decision-maker agree to an expedited timeline.\nThe Chief Accountability Officer, or their designee, serves as the Decision-maker for hearings.\xc2\xa0 The panel members for each hearing will be drawn from the Pool using a randomization process once any individuals in the Pool have been eliminated due to participation in the investigatory process, conflicts of interest, or bias.\n19. Hearing Decision-maker Composition\nThe single Decision-maker will Chair the hearing.\nThe Decision-maker(s) will not have had any previous involvement with the investigation. The Title IX Coordinator may elect to have an alternate from the Pool sit in throughout the hearing process in the event that a substitute is needed for any reason.\nThose who have served as Investigators will be witnesses in the hearing and therefore may not serve as Decision-makers. Those who are serving as Advisors for any party may not serve as Panelists in that matter.\nThe Title IX Coordinator may not serve as a Decision-maker or Chair in the matter but may serve as an administrative facilitator of the hearing if their previous role(s) in the matter do not create a conflict of interest. Otherwise, a designee may fulfill this role. The hearing will convene at a time determined by the Chair or designee.\n20. Evidentiary Considerations in the Hearing\nAny evidence that the Decision-maker(s) determine(s) is relevant and credible may be considered. The hearing does not consider: 1) incidents not directly related to the possible violation, unless they evidence a pattern; 2) the character of the parties; or 3) questions and evidence about the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent.\nPrevious disciplinary action of any kind involving the Respondent may be considered in determining an appropriate sanction upon a determination of responsibility, assuming UMB uses a progressive discipline system. This information is only considered at the sanction stage of the process, and is not shared until then.\nThe parties may each submit a written impact statement prior to the hearing for the consideration of the Decision-maker(s) at the sanction stage of the process when a determination of responsibility is reached.\nAfter post-hearing deliberation, the Decision-maker renders a determination based on a preponderance of the evidence; whether it is more likely than not that the Respondent violated the Policy as alleged.\n21. Notice of Hearing\nNo less than ten (10) business days prior to the hearing, the Title IX Coordinator will send notice of the hearing to the parties. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered.\nThe notice will contain:\nA description of the alleged violation(s), a list of all policies allegedly violated, a description of the applicable procedures, and a statement of the potential sanctions/remedial actions that could result.\nThe time, date, and location of the hearing and a reminder that attendance is mandatory, superseding all other campus activities.\nAny technology that will be used to facilitate the hearing.\nInformation about the option for the live hearing to occur with the parties located in separate rooms using technology that enables the Decision-maker(s) and parties to see and hear a party or witness answering questions. Such a request must be raised with the Title IX Coordinator at least five (5) business days prior to the hearing.\nA list of all those who will attend the hearing, along with an invitation to object to any Decision-maker on the basis of demonstrated bias. This must be raised with the Title IX Coordinator at least two (2) business days prior to the hearing.\nInformation on how the hearing will be recorded and on access to the recording for the parties after the hearing.\nA statement that if any party or witness does not appear at the scheduled hearing, the hearing may be held in their absence, and the party\xe2\x80\x99s or witness\xe2\x80\x99s testimony and any statements given prior to the hearing will not be considered by the Decision-maker(s). For compelling reasons, the Chair may reschedule the hearing.\nNotification that the parties may have the assistance of an Advisor of their choosing at the hearing and will be required to have one present for any questions they may desire to ask. The party must notify the Title IX Coordinator if they do not have an Advisor, and UMB will appoint one. Each party must have an Advisor present. There are no exceptions.\nA copy of all the materials provided to the Decision-maker(s) about the matter, unless they have been provided already.\nAn invitation to each party to submit to the Chair an impact statement pre-hearing that the Decision-maker will review during any sanction determination.\nAn invitation to contact the Title IX Coordinator to arrange any disability accommodations, language assistance, and/or interpretation services that may be needed at the hearing, at least seven (7) business days prior to the hearing.\nWhether parties can/cannot bring mobile phones/devices into the hearing.\nHearings for possible violations that occur near or after the end of an academic term (assuming the Respondent is still subject to this Policy) and are unable to be resolved prior to the end of term will typically be held immediately after the end of the term or during the summer, as needed, to meet the resolution timeline followed by UMB and remain within the 60 business day goal for resolution.\nIn these cases, if the Respondent is a graduating student, a hold may be placed on graduation and/or official transcripts until the matter is fully resolved (including any appeal). A student facing charges under this Policy is not in good standing to graduate.\n22. Alternative Hearing Participation Options\nIf a party or parties prefer not to attend or cannot attend the hearing in person, the party should request alternative arrangements from the Title IX Coordinator or the Chair at least five (5) business days prior to the hearing.\nThe Title IX Coordinator can arrange to use technology to allow remote testimony without compromising the fairness of the hearing. Remote options may also be needed for witnesses who cannot appear in person. Any witness who cannot attend in person should let the Title IX Coordinator or the Chair know at least five (5) business days prior to the hearing so that appropriate arrangements can be made.\n23. Pre-Hearing Preparation\nThe Chair or hearing facilitator after any necessary consultation with the parties, Investigator(s) and/or Title IX Coordinator, will provide the names of persons who will be participating in the hearing, all pertinent documentary evidence, and the final investigation report to the parties at least ten (10) business days prior to the hearing.\nAny witness scheduled to participate in the hearing must have been first interviewed by the Investigator(s) or have proffered a written statement or answered written questions, unless all parties and the Chair assent to the witness\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the hearing. The same holds for any evidence that is first offered at the hearing. If the parties and Chair do not assent to the admission of evidence newly offered at the hearing, the Chair may delay the hearing and instruct that the investigation needs to be re-opened to consider that evidence.\nThe parties will be given a list of the names of the Decision-maker and Panelists at least five (5) business days in advance of the hearing. All objections to any Decision-maker must be raised in writing, detailing the rationale for the objection, and must be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator as soon as possible and no later than one day prior to the hearing. Decision-makers will only be removed if the Title IX Coordinator concludes that their bias or conflict of interest precludes an impartial hearing of the allegation(s).\nThe Title IX Coordinator will give the Decision-maker(s) a list of the names of all parties, witnesses, and Advisors at least five (5) business days in advance of the hearing. Any Decision-maker who cannot make an objective determination must recuse themselves from the proceedings when notified of the identity of the parties, witnesses, and Advisors in advance of the hearing. If a Decision-maker is unsure of whether a bias or conflict of interest exists, they must raise the concern to the Title IX Coordinator as soon as possible.\nDuring the ten (10) business day period prior to the hearing, the parties have the opportunity for continued review and comment on the final investigation report and available evidence. That review and comment can be shared with the Chair at the pre-hearing meeting or at the hearing and will be exchanged between each party by the Chair.\nThe parties and advisors will receive written notice of procedures for the hearing at least five (5) days in advance.\n24. Pre-Hearing Meetings\nThe Chair may convene a pre-hearing meeting(s) with the parties and their Advisors to invite them to submit the questions or topics each party wishes to ask or discuss at the hearing, so that the Chair can rule on their relevance ahead of time to avoid any improper evidentiary introduction in the hearing or provide recommendations for more appropriate phrasing. However, this advance review opportunity does not preclude the Advisors from asking a question for the first time at the hearing or from asking for a reconsideration based on any new information or testimony offered at the hearing. The Chair must document and share with each party their rationale for any exclusion or inclusion at a pre-hearing meeting.\nThe Chair, only with full agreement of the parties, may decide in advance of the hearing that certain witnesses do not need to be present if their testimony can be adequately summarized by the Investigator(s) in the investigation report or during the hearing.\nAt each pre-hearing meeting with a party and their Advisor, the Chair will consider arguments that evidence identified in the final investigation report as relevant is, in fact, not relevant. Similarly, evidence identified as directly related but not relevant by the Investigator(s) may be argued to be relevant. The Chair may rule on these arguments pre-hearing and will exchange those rulings between the parties prior to the hearing to assist in preparation for the hearing. The Chair may consult with legal counsel and/or the Title IX Coordinator, or ask either or both to attend pre-hearing meetings.\n25. Hearing Procedures\nAt the hearing, the Decision-maker(s) has the authority to hear and make determinations on all allegations of discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation and may also hear and make determinations on any additional alleged policy violations that have occurred in concert with the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation, even though those collateral allegations may not specifically fall within the Policy.\nParticipants at the hearing will include the Chair, any additional panelists, the hearing facilitator, the Investigator(s) who conducted the investigation, the parties (or three (3) organizational representatives when an organization is the Respondent), Advisors to the parties, any called witnesses, the Title IX Coordinator, and anyone providing authorized accommodations or assistive services.\nThe Chair will answer all questions of procedure. Anyone appearing at the hearing to provide information will respond to questions on their own behalf.\nThe Chair will allow witnesses who have relevant information to appear at a portion of the hearing in order to respond to specific questions from the Panelists and the parties and the witnesses will then be excused.\n26. Joint Hearings\nIn hearings involving more than one Respondent or in which two (2) or more Complainants have accused the same individual of substantially similar conduct, the default procedure will be to hear the allegations jointly.\nHowever, the Title IX Coordinator may permit the investigation and/or hearings pertinent to each Respondent to be conducted separately if there is a compelling reason to do so. In joint hearings, separate determinations of responsibility will be made for each Respondent with respect to each alleged policy violation.\n27. The Order of the Hearing \xe2\x80\x93 Introductions and Explanation of Procedure\nThe Chair explains the procedures and introduces the participants. This may include a final opportunity for challenge or recusal of any member of the Hearing Panel on the basis of bias or conflict of interest. The Chair will rule on any such challenge unless the Chair is the individual who is the subject of the challenge, in which case the Title IX Coordinator will review and decide the challenge.\nAt the hearing, recording, witness logistics, party logistics, curation of documents, separation of the parties, and other administrative elements of the hearing process are managed by a non-voting hearing facilitator, either the Title IX Coordinator or an individual appointed by the Title IX Coordinator. The hearing facilitator may attend to: logistics of rooms for various parties/witnesses as they wait; flow of parties/witnesses in and out of the hearing space; ensuring recording and/or virtual conferencing technology is working as intended; copying and distributing materials to participants, as appropriate, etc.\n28. Investigator Presents the Final Investigation Report\nThe Investigator(s) will then present a summary of the final investigation report, including items that are contested and those that are not, and will be subject to questioning by the Hearing Panelists and the parties (through their Advisors). The Investigator(s) will be present during the entire hearing process, but not during deliberations.\nNeither the parties nor the Hearing Panel should ask the Investigator(s) their opinions on credibility, recommended findings, or determinations, and the Investigators, Advisors, and parties will refrain from discussion of or questions about these assessments. If such information is introduced, the Chair will direct that it be disregarded.\nThe pre-hearing meeting(s) may be recorded.\n29. Testimony and Questioning\nOnce the Investigator(s) present their report and are questioned, the parties and witnesses may provide relevant information in turn, beginning with the Complainant, and then in the order determined by the Chair. The parties/witnesses will submit to questioning by the Hearing Panel and then by the parties through their Advisors (\xe2\x80\x9ccross-examination\xe2\x80\x9d).\nAll questions are subject to a relevance determination by the Chair. The Advisor, who will remain seated during questioning, will pose the proposed question orally, electronically, or in writing (orally is the default, but other means of submission may be permitted by the Chair upon request if agreed to by all parties and the Chair), the proceeding will pause to allow the Chair to consider it (and state it if it has not been stated aloud), and the Chair will determine whether the question will be permitted, disallowed, or rephrased.\nThe Chair may invite explanations or persuasive statements regarding relevance with the Advisors, if the Chair so chooses. The Chair will then state their decision on the question for the record and advise the party/witness to whom the question was directed, accordingly. The Chair will explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant, or to reframe it for relevance.\nThe Chair will limit or disallow questions on the basis that they are irrelevant, unduly repetitious (and thus irrelevant), or abusive. The Chair has final say on all questions and determinations of relevance. The Chair may consult with legal counsel on any questions of admissibility. The Chair may ask Advisors to frame why a question is or is not relevant from their perspective but will not entertain argument from the Advisors on relevance once the Chair has ruled on a question.\nIf the parties raise an issue of bias or conflict of interest of an Investigator or Hearing Panelist at the hearing, the Chair may elect to address those issues, consult with legal counsel, and/or refer them to the Title IX Coordinator, and/or preserve them for appeal. If bias is not in issue at the hearing, the Chair should not permit irrelevant questions that probe for bias.\n30. Refusal to Submit to Cross-Examination and Inferences\nIf a party or witness chooses not to submit to cross-examination at the hearing, either because they do not attend the meeting, or they attend but refuse to participate in questioning, then the Decision-maker(s) may not rely on any prior statement made by that party or witness at the hearing (including those contained in the investigation report) in the ultimate determination of responsibility. The Decision-maker(s) must disregard that statement. Evidence provided that is something other than a statement by the party or witness may be considered.\nIf the party or witness attends the hearing and answers some cross-examination questions, only statements related to the cross-examination questions they refuse to answer cannot be relied upon. However, if the statements of the party who is refusing to submit to cross-examination or refuses to attend the hearing are the subject of the allegation itself (e.g., the case is about verbal harassment or a quid pro quo offer), then those statements are not precluded from admission. Similarly, statements can be relied upon when questions are posed by the Hearing Panelists, as distinguished from questions posed by Advisors through cross-examination.\nThe Hearing Panelists may not draw any inference solely from a party\xe2\x80\x99s or witness\xe2\x80\x99s absence from the hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions.\nIf charges of policy violations other than sexual harassment are considered at the same hearing, the Hearing Panelists may consider all evidence it deems relevant, may rely on any relevant statement as long as the opportunity for cross-examination is afforded to all parties through their Advisors, and may draw reasonable inferences from any decision by any party or witness not to participate or respond to questions.\nIf a party\xe2\x80\x99s Advisor of choice refuses to comply with UMB\xe2\x80\x99s established rules of decorum for the hearing, UMB may require the party to use a different Advisor. If a UMB-provided Advisor refuses to comply with the rules of decorum, UMB may provide that party with a different Advisor to conduct cross-examination on behalf of that party.\n31. Recording Hearings\nHearings (but not deliberations) are recorded by UMB for purposes of review in the event of an appeal. The parties may not record the proceedings and no other unauthorized recordings are permitted.\nThe Hearing Panelists, the parties, their Advisors, and appropriate administrators of UMB will be permitted to listen to the recording in a controlled environment determined by the Title IX Coordinator. No person will be given or be allowed to make a copy of the recording without permission of the Title IX Coordinator.\n32. Deliberation, Decision-making, and Standard of Proof\nThe Hearing Panelists will deliberate in closed session to determine whether the Respondent is responsible or not responsible for the policy violation(s) in question. A simple majority vote is required to determine the finding. The preponderance of the evidence standard of proof is used. The hearing facilitator may be invited to attend the deliberation by the Chair, but is there only to facilitate procedurally, not to address the substance of the allegations.\nWhen there is a finding of responsibility on one or more of the allegations, the Hearing Panelists may then consider the previously submitted party impact statements in determining appropriate sanction(s).\nThe Chair will ensure that each of the parties has an opportunity to review any impact statement submitted by the other party(ies). The Hearing Panelists may \xe2\x80\x93 at their discretion \xe2\x80\x93 consider the statements, but they are not binding.\nThe Hearing Panelists will review the statements and any pertinent conduct history that may have been provided by the party\xe2\x80\x99s School or administrative unit and will determine the appropriate sanction(s).\nThe Chair will then prepare a written deliberation statement and deliver it to the Title IX Coordinator, detailing the determination, rationale, the evidence used in support of its determination, the evidence not relied upon in its determination, credibility assessments, and any remedial actions or sanctions.\nThis report is typically three (3) to five (5) pages in length and must be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator within five (5) business days of the end of deliberations, unless the Title IX Coordinator grants an extension. If an extension is granted, the Title IX Coordinator will notify the parties.\n33. Notice of Outcome\nUsing the deliberation statement, the Title IX Coordinator will work with the Chair to prepare a Notice of Outcome, which may be reviewed by legal counsel. The Title IX Coordinator will then share the letter, including the final determination, rationale, and any applicable remedial actions and/or sanction(s) with the parties and their Advisors within seven (7) business days of receiving the Decision-maker(s)\xe2\x80\x99 deliberation statement.\nThe Notice of Outcome will then be shared with the parties simultaneously. Notification will be made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in official UMB records, or emailed to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 UMB-issued email or otherwise approved account. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered.\nThe Notice of Outcome will articulate the specific policy(ies) reported to have been violated, including the relevant policy section, and will contain a description of the procedural steps taken by UMB from the receipt of the misconduct report to the determination, including any and all notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to obtain evidence, and hearings held.\nThe Notice of Outcome will specify the finding on each alleged policy violation; the findings of fact that support the determination; conclusions regarding the application of the relevant policy to the facts at issue; a statement of, and rationale for, the result of each allegation to the extent UMB is permitted to share such information under state or federal law; any sanctions issued which UMB is permitted to share according to state or federal law; and any remedies provided to the Complainant designed to ensure access to the UMB\xe2\x80\x99s educational or employment program or activity, to the extent UMB is permitted to share such information under state or federal law (this detail is not typically shared with the Respondent unless the remedy directly relates to the Respondent).\nThe Notice of Outcome will also include information on when the results are considered by UMB to be final, any changes that occur prior to finalization, and the relevant procedures and bases for any available appeal options.\n34. Sanctions\nFactors considered when determining a sanction/remedial action may include, but are not limited to:\nThe nature, severity of, and circumstances surrounding the violation(s)\nThe Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary history\nPrevious allegations or allegations involving similar conduct\nThe need for sanctions/remedial actions to bring an end to the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation\nThe need for sanctions/remedial actions to prevent the future recurrence of\nThe need to remedy the effects of the discrimination, harassment, and/or discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation on the Complainant and the community\nThe impact on the parties\nAny other information deemed relevant by the Decision-maker(s)\nThe sanctions will be implemented as soon as is feasible, either upon the outcome of any appeal or the expiration of the window to appeal without an appeal being requested.\nThe sanctions described in the Policy are not exclusive of, and may be in addition to, other actions taken or sanctions imposed by external authorities or entities.\na. Student Sanctions\nThe following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:\nWarning: A formal statement that the conduct was unacceptable and a warning that further violation of any UMB policy, procedure, or directive will result in more severe sanctions/remedial actions.\nProbation: A written reprimand for violation of institutional policy, providing for more severe disciplinary sanctions in the event that the student or organization is found in violation of any institutional policy, procedure, or directive within a specified period of time. Terms of the probation will be articulated and may include denial of specified social privileges, exclusion from co-curricular activities, exclusion from designated areas of campus, no-contact orders, and/or other measures deemed appropriate.\nSuspension: Termination of student status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Students who return from suspension are automatically placed on probation through the remainder of their tenure as a student at UMB.\nDismissal: Permanent termination of student status and revocation of rights to be on campus for any reason or to attend UMB-sponsored events. This sanction will be noted permanently as a Conduct Expulsion on the student\xe2\x80\x99s official transcript.\nRequired Counseling: A mandate to meet with and engage in either UMB-sponsored or external counseling to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.\nRequired Training or Education: A mandate to engage in either UMB-sponsored or external training or educational programs to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.\nWithholding Degree: UMB may withhold a student\xe2\x80\x99s degree for a specified period of time and/or deny a student participation in commencement activities if the student has an allegation pending or as a sanction if the student is found responsible for an alleged violation.\nRevocation of Degree: UMB reserves the right to revoke a degree previously awarded from the UMB for fraud, misrepresentation, and/or other violation of UMB policies, procedures, or directives in obtaining the degree, or for other serious violations committed by a student prior to graduation.\nTranscript Notation: A permanent notation on the student\xe2\x80\x99s official transcript of the policy violation.\nOther Actions: In addition to or in place of the above sanctions, UMB may assign any other sanctions as deemed appropriate.\nb. Employee Sanctions/Remedial Actions\nThe following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:\nWarning \xe2\x80\x93 Verbal or Written: A formal verbal or written statement that the conduct was unacceptable and a warning that further violation of any UMB policy, procedure, or directive will result in more severe sanctions/remedial actions.\nPerformance Improvement Plan: Inclusion of the violation on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s Performance Improvement Plan with corrective actions to be taken by the employee.\nRequired Counseling: A mandate to meet with and engage in either UMB-sponsored or external counseling to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.\nRequired Training or Education: A mandate to engage in either UMB-sponsored or external training or educational programs to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.\nDemotion: Lowering the employee\xe2\x80\x99s status, title, and, if appropriate, pay.\nSuspension with pay: Termination of employee\xe2\x80\x99s status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Employees who return from suspension with pay are automatically placed on probation for a period to be determined at the time of suspension. The employee will continue to receive their base salary during the suspension period.\nSuspension without pay: Termination of employee\xe2\x80\x99s status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Employees who return from suspension with pay are automatically placed on probation for a period to be determined at the time of suspension. The employee will not receive their salary during the suspension period.\nTermination: UMB will end its employment agreement with the employee. The employee will not be eligible to be re-hired by UMB.\nOther Actions: In addition to or in place of the above sanctions/remedial actions, UMB may assign any other remedial actions as deemed appropriate.\n36. Withdrawal or Resignation While Charges Pending\na. Students\nThe Policy on Sexual Misconduct provides the potential outcomes should a student withdrawal or resign with charges are pending.\nb. Employees\nThe Policy on Sexual Misconduct provides the potential outcomes should an employee resign with charges are pending.\n37. Appeals\nAny party may file a request for appeal (\xe2\x80\x9cRequest for Appeal\xe2\x80\x9d), but it must be submitted in writing to the Title IX Coordinator within five (5) days of the delivery of the Notice of Outcome.\nA single Appeal Decision-maker (\xe2\x80\x9cAppeal Chair\xe2\x80\x9d) will hear the appeal, who has not been previously involved in the process, including any dismissal appeal that may have been heard.\nThe Request for Appeal will be forwarded to the Appeal Chair for consideration to determine if the request meets the grounds for appeal (a Review for Standing).\nThis review of the Request for Appeal is not a review of the merits of the appeal, but solely a determination as to whether the request meets the grounds and is timely filed.\na. Grounds for Appeal\nAppeals are limited to the following grounds:\n(A) Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;\n(B) New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; and\n(C) The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Panelist(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the specific Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.\nIf any of the grounds in the Request for Appeal do not meet the grounds in this Policy, that request will be denied by the Appeal Chair and the parties and their Advisors will be notified in writing of the denial and the rationale.\nIf any of the grounds in the Request for Appeal meet the grounds in this Policy, then the Appeal Chair will notify the other party(ies) and their Advisors, the Title IX Coordinator, and, when appropriate, the Investigators and/or the original Hearing Panelists.\nThe other party(ies) and their Advisors, the Title IX Coordinator, and, when appropriate, the Investigators and/or the original Hearing Panelists will be mailed, emailed, and/or provided a hard copy of the request with the approved grounds and then be given five (5) business days to submit a response to the portion of the appeal that was approved and involves them. All responses will be forwarded by the Chair to all parties for review and comment.\nThe non-appealing party (if any) may also choose to raise a new ground for appeal at this time. If so, that will be reviewed to determine if it meets the grounds in this Policy by the Appeal Chair and either denied or approved. If approved, it will be forwarded to the party who initially requested an appeal, the Investigator(s) and/or original Hearing Panelist(s), as necessary, who will submit their responses in five (5) business days, which will be circulated for review and comment by all parties.\nNeither party may submit any new requests for appeal after this time period. The Appeal Chair will collect any additional information needed and all documentation regarding the approved grounds and the subsequent responses and the Appeal Chair will render a decision in no more than seven (7) business days, barring exigent circumstances. All decisions apply the preponderance of the evidence standard.\nA Notice of Appeal Outcome will be sent to all parties simultaneously including the decision on each approved ground and rationale for each decision. The Notice of Appeal Outcome will specify the finding on each ground for appeal, any specific instructions for remand or reconsideration, any sanctions that may result which UMB is permitted to share according to state or federal law, and the rationale supporting the essential findings to the extent UMB is permitted to share under state or federal law.\nNotification will be made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in official UMB records, or emailed to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 UMB-issued email or otherwise approved account. Once mailed, emailed and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered.\nb. Sanctions Status During the Appeal\nAny sanctions imposed as a result of the hearing are stayed during the appeal process. Supportive measures may be maintained or, if necessary reinstated, subject to the same supportive measure procedures above.\nIf any of the sanctions are to be implemented immediately post-hearing, but pre-appeal, then emergency removal procedures (detailed above) for a hearing on the justification for doing so must be permitted within 48 hours of implementation.\nUMB may still place holds on official transcripts, diplomas, graduations, and course registration pending the outcome of an appeal when the original sanctions included separation.\nc. Appeal Considerations\nDecisions on appeal are to be deferential to the original decision, making changes to the finding only when there is clear error and to the sanction(s)/remedial action(s) only if there is a compelling justification to do so.\nAppeals are not intended to provide for a full re-hearing (de novo) of the allegation(s). In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation or record of the original hearing and pertinent documentation regarding the specific grounds for appeal.\nAn appeal is not an opportunity for the Appeal Chair to substitute his/her judgment for that of the original Decision-maker(s) merely because he/she disagree with the finding and/or sanction(s).\nThe Appeal Chair may consult with the Title IX Coordinator on questions of procedure or rationale, for clarification, if needed. Documentation of all such consultation will be maintained.\nAppeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the original Investigator(s) and/or Decision-maker(s) for reconsideration. Other appeals may be remanded at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator or, in limited circumstances, decided on appeal.\nOnce an appeal is decided, the outcome is final: further appeals are not permitted, even if a decision or sanction is changed on remand (except in the case of a new hearing).\nIn rare cases where a procedural [or substantive] error cannot be cured by the original Hearing Panelist(s) (as in cases of bias), the appeal may order a new hearing with a new Hearing Panelist(s).\nThe results of a remand to the Hearing Panelists cannot be appealed.\nIn cases in which the appeal results in reinstatement to UMB or resumption of privileges, all reasonable attempts will be made to restore the Respondent to their prior status, recognizing that some opportunities lost may be irreparable in the short term.\n38. Long-Term Remedies/Other Actions\nFollowing the conclusion of the resolution process, and in addition to any sanctions implemented, the Title IX Coordinator may implement additional long-term remedies or actions with respect to the parties and/or the campus community that are intended to stop the harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation, remedy the effects, and prevent reoccurrence.\nThese remedies/actions may include, but are not limited to:\nReferral to counseling and health services\nReferral to the Employee Assistance Program\nEducation to the individual and/or the community\nPermanent alteration of housing assignments\nPermanent alteration of work arrangements for employees\nProvision of campus safety escorts\nClimate surveys\nProvision of transportation accommodations\nImplementation of long-term contact limitations between the parties\nImplementation of adjustments to academic deadlines, course schedules, etc.\nAt the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, certain long-term support or measures may also be provided to the parties even if no policy violation is found.\nWhen no policy violation is found, the Title IX Coordinator will address any remedies owed by UMB to the Respondent to ensure no effective denial of educational access.\nUMB will maintain the privacy of any long-term remedies/actions/measures, provided privacy does not impair UMB\xe2\x80\x99s ability to provide these services.\n39. Failure to Comply with Sanctions and/or Interim and Long-term Remedies and/or Remedial Actions\nAll Respondents are expected to comply with the assigned sanctions, remedial actions, and/or corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the final Decision-maker(s) (including the Appeal Chair).\nFailure to abide by the sanction(s)/action(s) imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanction(s)/action(s), including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination from UMB and may be noted on a student\xe2\x80\x99s official transcript.\nA suspension will only be lifted when compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.\n40. Recordkeeping\nUMB will maintain for a period of seven years records of:\nEach sexual harassment investigation including any determination regarding responsibility and any audio or audiovisual recording or transcript required under federal regulation;\nAny disciplinary sanctions imposed on the Respondent;\nAny remedies provided to the Complainant designed to restore or preserve equal access to UMB\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity;\nAny appeal and the result therefrom;\nAny Informal Resolution and the result therefrom;\nAll materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, Investigators, Decision-makers, and any person who facilitates an Informal Resolution process. UMB will make these training materials publicly available on UMB\xe2\x80\x99s website or available for public inspection upon request; and\nAny actions, including any supportive measures, taken in response to a report or formal complaint of sexual harassment, including:\nThe basis for all conclusions that the response was not deliberately indifferent;\nAny measures designed to restore or preserve equal access to UMB\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity; and\nIf no supportive measures were provided to the Complainant, document the reasons why such a response was not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\nUMB will also maintain any and all records in accordance with state and federal laws.\n41. Disabilities Accommodations in the Resolution Process\nUMB is committed to providing reasonable accommodations and support to qualified students, employees, or others with disabilities to ensure equal access to the UMB\xe2\x80\x99s resolution process.\nStudents needing such accommodations or support should complete the Disability and Reasonable Accommodations form located on the Educational Support and Disability Services website located at: https://www.umaryland.edu/disabilityservices/for-students/how-to-request-accommodations/.\xc2\xa0 Employees should complete the Request for Reasonable Accommodation form and submitting it to Human Resource Services (HRS) Employee Labor Relations (ELR), Office of Diversity, ADA and Affirmative Action located at https://www.umaryland.edu/hrs/current-employees/diversity-ada-aa/americans-with-disabilities-act/. Students and employees seeking accommodations or support should inform the Title IX Coordinator when they have submitted the request(s) to allow for consultation to determine which accommodations are appropriate and necessary for full participation in the process.\n42. Revision of this Policy and Procedures\nThese procedures supersede any previous procedures for addressing harassment, sexual misconduct, discrimination, and/or retaliation under Title IX and will be reviewed and updated annually by the Title IX Coordinator. UMB reserves the right to make changes to this document as necessary, and once those changes are posted online, they are in effect.\nDuring the resolution process, the Title IX Coordinator may make minor modifications to procedures that do not materially jeopardize the fairness owed to any party, such as to accommodate summer schedules. The Title IX Coordinator may also vary procedures materially with notice (on the institutional website, with the appropriate effective date identified) upon determining that changes to law or regulation require policy or procedural alterations not reflected in these procedures.\nIf government laws or regulations change \xe2\x80\x93 or court decisions alter \xe2\x80\x93 the requirements in a way that impacts this document, this document will be construed to comply with the most recent government regulations or holdings.\nThis document does not create legally enforceable protections beyond the protection of the background state and federal laws which frame such policies and codes, generally.\nTHESE PROCEDURES WERE ADAPTED FROM ATIXA 2020 ONE POLICY, TWO PROCEDURES MODEL\nUSE AND ADAPTATION OF THIS MODEL WITH CITATION TO ATIXA IS PERMITTED THROUGH A LIMITED LICENSE TO UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE\nALL OTHER RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\xc2\xa92020.

Compliance\n|\nApproved August 14, 2020\nPurpose\nTo describe how UMB will respond to allegations of harassment or discrimination on the basis of protected class status involving students, staff, faculty members, or third parties, that do not fall into under the jurisdiction of the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX).\nApplicability\nThe procedures described below apply to all allegations of harassment or discrimination on the basis of protected class status involving students, staff, faculty members, or third parties, that do not fall into under the jurisdiction of the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX).\nProcedure\nUMB will act on any formal or informal allegation or notice of violation of the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct that is received by the Title IX Coordinator or a member of the administration, faculty, or other employee, with the exception of confidential resources, as articulated in UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Policy on Sexual Misconduct.\n1. Overview\nThe procedures described below apply to all allegations of harassment or discrimination on the basis of protected class status involving students, staff, faculty members, or third parties, that do not fall into under the jurisdiction of the federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 (Title IX).\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Allegations that are assessed to be potential violations of the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct that are within the scope of Title IX will be processed using the UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Federal Regulations Implementing Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX Procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 VAWA Section 304 requirements apply to this, or any alternative process, for reports that fall under VAWA. Title IX requirements outside of Section 106.30 (based on the original 1975 regulations, the 2001 Revised Guidance, etc.) may also apply to these Non-Title IX Procedures.\nThese procedures may also be used to resolve non-sexual misconduct violations of UMB policy if the collateral misconduct arises from the investigation of or occurring in conjunction with the alleged discriminatory sexual conduct. Other allegations of misconduct unrelated to sexual misconduct allegations will be addressed through other appropriate UMB procedures.\nThese procedures incorporate by reference the definitions in the UMB Policy.\n2. Initial Assessment\nFollowing intake, receipt of notice, or a complaint of an alleged violation of the UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Policy on Sexual Misconduct (the \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy\xe2\x80\x9d), the Title IX Coordinator engages in a prompt Initial Assessment and a reasonable cause assessment to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support further review of the complaint under the UMB Policy, and to determine the next steps UMB will take.\xc2\xa0 The Initially Assessment typically takes one to five business days.\nIf the initial assessment determines the alleged misconduct does not fall under the scope of Title IX but may be violation of the UMB Policy the Title IX Coordinator will send a Notice of Dismissal under the Title IX Procedures that includes confirmation these Non-Title IX Procedures will be applied to assess and address the alleged misconduct.\nThe initial assessment includes, but is not limited to:\nThe Title IX Coordinator reaches out to the Complainant to offer supportive measures.\nThe Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to ensure they have an Advisor.\nThe Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to determine whether the Complainant prefers a supportive response or an Administrative Resolution.\nIf a supportive and remedial response is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator works with the Complainant to identify their preferences and then seeks to facilitate implementation. The Administrative Resolution process is not initiated, though the Complainant can elect to initiate it later, if desired.\nIf an Informal Resolution option is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator assesses whether the complaint is suitable for informal resolution, [which informal mechanism may serve the situation best or is available] and may seek to determine if the Respondent is also willing to engage in Informal Resolution.\nIf Administrative Resolution is preferred, the Title IX Coordinator initiates the investigation process and determines whether the scope of the investigation will address:\nIncident, and/or\nA potential pattern of misconduct, and/or\nA culture/climate issue.\nIn many cases, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that a Violence Risk Assessment (VRA) should be conducted by the UMB Behavioral Awareness and Threat Assessment (BETA) Team as part of the Initial Assessment. A VRA can aid in ten critical and/or required determinations, including:\nInterim suspension of a Respondent who is a threat to health/safety;\nWhether the Title IX Coordinator should pursue Administrative Resolution absent a willing/able Complainant;\nWhether to put the investigation on the footing of incident and/or pattern and/or climate;\nTo help identify potentially predatory conduct;\nTo help assess/identify grooming behaviors;\nWhether to permit a voluntary withdrawal by the Respondent;\nWhether to impose transcript notation or communicate with a transfer about a Respondent;\nWhether a Clery Act Timely Warning/Trespass order/Persona-non-grata is needed.\nBased on the Initial Assessment, UMB will initiate one of two responses under these Non-Title IX Procedures:\nInformal Resolution \xe2\x80\x93 typically used for less serious offenses and only when all parties agree, or when the Respondent is willing to accept responsibility for violating policy. This can also include a remedies-only response.\nAdministrative Resolution following Formal Investigation \xe2\x80\x93 formal investigation of allegation(s) and recommended findings, subject to a determination by a Decision-maker and the opportunity to appeal to an Appeal Panel/Appeal Decision-maker.\nThe Formal Investigation and the subsequent Administrative Resolution determine whether the UMB Policy has been violated. If so, UMB will promptly implement effective remedies designed to end the discrimination, prevent recurrence, and address the effects.\nThe process followed considers the preference of the parties but is ultimately determined at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator. At any point during the Initial Assessment, the Informal Resolution or the Administrative Resolution, the process will end if the Title IX Coordinator determines that the alleged misconduct is subject not to the jurisdiction of the UMB Policy or that there is insufficient evidence to supports further Informal Resolution or Administrative Resolution activity under the UMB Policy. In which case, the process will end, and the parties will be notified.\nThe Complainant may request that the Title IX Coordinator review the determination to end the Informal Resolution or Administrative Resolution and/re-open the investigation. This decision lies in the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, with oversight of the Chief Accountability Officer, and must be based on good cause shown.\n3. Counterclaims\nCounterclaims by the Respondent may be made in good faith but are also sometimes made for purposes of retaliation. UMB is obligated to ensure that any process is not abused for retaliatory purposes.\nUMB permits the filing of counterclaims, and uses the Initial Assessment, described above, to assess whether the allegations are made in good faith and if there is evidence supporting a conclusion the allegation was made for purposes of retaliatory or other improper purposes, in which case the Title IX Coordinator may dismiss the counterclaim, subject to a Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request that the Title IX Coordinator review the dismissal and re-open the investigation.\xc2\xa0 This decision lies in the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator with oversight of the Chief Accountability Officer and must be based on good cause shown. \xc2\xa0This decision may be appealed by either party within five (5) days of receipt of the written decision to dismiss through the process included for appeals herein.\xc2\xa0 Counterclaims will be processed using the resolution procedures below, typically after resolution of the underlying allegation.\nA delay in the processing of counterclaims is permitted, accordingly. Occasionally, allegations and counterclaims can be resolved through the same Informal Resolution or Administrative Resolution - Formal Investigation, at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator. When counterclaims are not made in good faith, they will be considered retaliatory, and may constitute a violation of UMB Policy.\n4. Advisors\na. Expectations of an Advisor\nAn individual serving as an Advisor should not accept role the before considering UMB\xe2\x80\x99s expectations as follows:\nUMB generally expects an Advisor to have a sufficiently flexible schedule to allow the Advisor to attend all meetings when planned.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0UMB will consider requests to change scheduled meetings to accommodate an Advisor\xe2\x80\x99s inability to attend, if doing so does not cause an unreasonable burden or delay.\nUMB may also make reasonable provisions to allow an Advisor who cannot attend a meeting in person to attend a meeting by telephone, video conferencing, or other similar technology as may be convenient and available.\nParties whose Advisors are disruptive or who do not abide by UMB policies and procedures may be required to select an alternative Advisor.\nAdvisors are expected to consult with their advisees without disrupting UMB meetings or interviews. Advisors do not represent parties in the process as legal advocates.\xc2\xa0 The Advisor\xe2\x80\x99s role is only to advise their advisee.\nb. Expectations of the Parties with Respect to Advisors\nEach party may choose an Advisor who is eligible and available to accompany them throughout the process. The Advisor can be anyone, including an attorney, but cannot be someone who is also a witness in the process or whom otherwise may be involved in or have a direct interest in the circumstances of the complaint.\xc2\xa0 A party may elect to change Advisors during the process and is not obligated to use the same Advisor throughout.\nThe parties are expected to inform the investigator(s) of the identity of their Advisor at least two (2) business days before the date of their first meeting with the Investigator(s) (or as soon as \xc2\xa0possible if a more expeditious meeting is necessary or desired).\nThe parties are expected to provide timely notice to the Investigator(s) and/or the Title IX Coordinator if they change Advisors at any time.\nUMB will not copy the Advisor on all communications between the UMB and the party. It is the responsibility of the parties to keep their Advisors informed.\xc2\xa0 The Advisor may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) regarding private, sensitive records and information.\nFor parties who are entitled to union representation, UMB will allow the unionized employee to have their union representative (if requested by the party) as well as an Advisor of their choice present for all resolution-related meetings and interviews. To uphold the principles of equity, the other party (regardless of union membership) will also be permitted to have two Advisors. Witnesses are/are not permitted to have union representation or Advisors in grievance process interviews or meetings.\nAt the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, more than one Advisor may be permitted to the parties, upon request.\xc2\xa0 For equity purposes, if one party is allowed another Advisor, the other party must be allowed one to as well.\nc. Assistance in Securing an Advisor\nUMB does not provide Advisors under this Non-Title IX Procedure.\nFor representation, Respondents may wish to contact organizations such as:\nFACE (http://www.facecampusequality.org)\nSAVE (http://www.saveservices.org)\nComplainants may wish to contact organizations such as:\nThe Victim Rights Law Center (http://www.victimrights.org)\nThe National Center for Victims of Crime (http://www.victimsofcrime.org), which maintains the Crime Victim\xe2\x80\x99s Bar Association\nThe Time\xe2\x80\x99s Up Legal Defense Fund: https://nwlc.org/times-up-legal-defense-fund/\n5. Resolution Options\nProceedings under the Policy, records of the matter, including copies of evidence and related communications, are confidential. All persons present at any time during the resolution process are expected to maintain the confidentiality of the proceedings.\nWhile there is an expectation of confidentiality regarding interviews, the parties have discretion to share their own experiences with others if they so choose, provided confidential and legally protected information is not improperly shared.\xc2\xa0 Parties are also encouraged to discuss the appropriateness of sharing information with their Advisors first before making disclosures.\na. Informal Resolution\nInformal Resolution is applicable when the parties voluntarily agree to resolve the matter through Alternate Resolution, or when the Respondent accepts responsibility for violating the Policy, or when the Title IX Coordinator can resolve the matter informally by providing remedies to resolve the situation.\nIt is not necessary to pursue Informal Resolution first in order to pursue Administrative Resolution, and any party participating in Informal Resolution can stop the process at any time and request the Administrative Resolution process. Further, if an Informal Resolution fails, Administrative Resolution may be pursued.\ni. Alternate Resolution\nAlternate Resolution is a type of Informal Resolution process, and includes options such as mediation or restorative practices, by which the parties mutually agree to resolve an allegation. It may be used for less serious, yet potentially offensive, behaviors and is encouraged as an alternative to the Administrative Resolution process (described below) to resolve conflicts. The parties must consent to the use of Alternate Resolution.\nThe Title IX Coordinator determines if Alternate Resolution is appropriate, based on the willingness of the parties, the nature of the conduct at issue, and the susceptibility of the conduct to Alternate Resolution.\nIn an Alternate Resolution meeting, a trained administrator facilitates a dialogue with the parties to reach an effective resolution, if possible.\nThe Title IX Coordinator maintains records of any resolution that is reached, and failure to abide by the resolution can result in appropriate corrective actions to achieve compliance.\nAlternate Resolution is not typically the primary resolution mechanism used to address reports of violent behavior of any kind or in other cases of serious violations of policy, though it may be made available after the Administrative Resolution process is completed should the parties and the Title IX Coordinator believe it could be beneficial. The results of Alternate Resolution are not appealable.\nii. Respondent Accepts Responsibility for Alleged Violations\nThe Respondent may accept responsibility for all or part of the alleged policy violations at any point during the resolution process. If the Respondent accepts responsibility, the Title IX Coordinator makes a determination that the individual has admitted to violation of UMB Policy.\nThe Title IX Coordinator then determines appropriate sanction(s) or remedial actions, which are promptly implemented in order to effectively stop the harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation; prevent its recurrence; and remedy the effects of the conduct, both on the Complainant and the community.\nIf the Respondent accepts responsibility for all of the alleged policy violations and the Title IX Coordinator or designee has determined appropriate sanction(s) or remedial actions, which are promptly implemented, the resolution process is over. The Complainant will be informed of this outcome.\xc2\xa0 And conclusion of the complaint will be recorded in the Title IX Coordinator files.\nIf the Respondent accepts responsibility for some of the alleged policy violations but not others.\xc2\xa0 The Title IX Coordinator will determine appropriate sanction(s) or remedial actions, to be promptly implemented, for admitted violations.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The remaining allegations will continue to be investigated and resolved. The Complainant will be informed of this outcome. The parties are still able to seek Alternate Resolution on the remaining allegations, subject to the procedures above.\niii. Negotiated Resolution\nThe Title IX Coordinator, with the consent of the parties, may negotiate and implement an agreement to resolve the allegations that satisfies UMB and all parties.\nb. Administrative Resolution \xe2\x80\x93 Formal Investigation\nAdministrative Resolution can be pursued for any behavior for which the Respondent has not accepted responsibility that constitutes conduct covered by the UMB Policy which is outside the scope of Title IX at any time during the process. Administrative Resolution starts with a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation.\nIf Administrative Resolution is initiated, the Title IX Coordinator will provide written notification of the investigation to the parties.\xc2\xa0 Typically, notice to a party or witness of an Investigation interview is given at least 48 hours in advance of the interview. Advanced notice facilitates the parties\xe2\x80\x99 ability to identify and choose an Advisor, if any, to accompany them to the interview.\nNotification of an Investigation will include a meaningful summary of the allegations, will be made in writing, and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in official UMB records, or emailed to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 UMB-issued or designated email account.\nOnce mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively delivered. The notification of an Investigation will identify the policies allegedly violated, if known at the time. Alternatively, the policies allegedly violated can be provided at a later date, in writing, as the investigation progresses, and details become clearer.\nUMB aims to complete all investigations within a thirty (30) business days, which can be extended as necessary by the Title IX Coordinator when good cause has been shown, with notice to the parties as appropriate. Investigations are completed expeditiously, though some investigations take weeks or even months, depending on the nature, extent, and complexity of the allegations, availability of witnesses, police involvement, etc.\nUMB will make a good faith effort to complete investigations as promptly as circumstances permit and will communicate regularly with the parties to update them on the progress and timing of the investigation.\nUMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to weeks) to allow evidence collection when criminal charges based on the same behaviors that invoke UMB\xe2\x80\x99s resolution process are being investigated by law enforcement. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process once notified by law enforcement that the initial evidence collection process is complete.\nUMB action(s) are not typically delayed, altered or precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.\nOnce the decision is made to commence an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator assigns an Investigator to conduct the investigation, usually within two (2) business days of determining that an investigation should proceed. At the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, more than one Investigator may be assigned.\nThe Title IX Coordinator will vet the assigned Investigator(s) to ensure impartiality by ensuring there are no conflicts of interest or disqualifying bias.\nThe parties may, at any time during this process, raise a concern regarding bias or conflict of interest, and the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether the concern is reasonable and supportable. If so, another Investigator will be assigned and the impact of the bias or conflict, if any, will be remedied if necessary. If the bias or conflict relates to the Title IX Coordinator, concerns should be raised with the Chief Accountability Officer.\nInvestigations involve interviews with all relevant parties and witnesses, obtaining available, relevant evidence, and identifying sources of expert information, as necessary.\nAll parties have a full and fair opportunity, though the investigation process, to suggest witnesses and questions, to provide evidence, and to fully review and respond to all relevant evidence, on the record.\n6. Investigation\nThe Investigators typically take the following steps, if not already completed (not necessarily in this order):\nDetermine the identity and contact information of the Complainant\nIn coordination with campus partners (e.g., the Title IX Coordinator), initiate or assist with any necessary supportive measures\nIdentify all policies implicated by the alleged misconduct\nAssist the Title IX Coordinator with conducting an initial assessment to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe the Respondent has violated policy\nIf there is insufficient evidence to support an Investigation of the allegation, the process is closed with no further action. The decision to close the Investigation on this basis is appealable for reconsideration to the Investigator or the Title IX Coordinator.\nCommence a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation by developing a strategic investigation plan, including a witness list, evidence list, intended investigation timeframe, and order of interviews for all parties and witnesses\nMeet with the Complainant to obtain information for a full and final statement, if necessary\nPrepare the initial Notice of Investigation and Allegation (NOIA) on the basis of the initial assessment. Notice may be one step or multiple steps, depending on how the investigation unfolds, and potential policy violations may be added or dropped as more is learned. Investigators will update the NOIA accordingly and provide it to the parties.\nNotice should inform the parties of their right to have the assistance of an Advisor of their choosing present for all meetings attended by the advisee\nWhen formal notice is given, it should provide the parties with a written description of the alleged violation(s), a list of all policies allegedly violated, a description of the applicable procedures, and a statement of the potential sanctions/remedial actions that could result\nGive an instruction to the parties to preserve any evidence that is directly related to the allegations\nProvide the parties and witnesses with an opportunity to review and verify the accuracy of Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s summary notes from interviews and meetings with that specific party or witness.\nMake good faith efforts to notify the parties of any meeting or interview involving the other party for informational purposes, in advance when possible\nInterview all relevant individuals and conduct follow-up interviews as necessary\nAllow each party the opportunity to submit questions they wish the Investigator(s) to ask of the other party and witnesses for review and approval of the Title IX Coordinator. The decision of final questions to be presented is made by the Title IX Coordinator in consultation with the Investigator.\nComplete the investigation promptly and without unreasonable deviation from the intended timeline\nProvide regular status updates to the parties throughout the investigation\nPrior to the conclusion of the investigation, summarize for the parties the list of witnesses whose information will be used to determine a finding\nWrite a comprehensive investigation report fully summarizing the investigation and all evidence\nProvide parties with a copy of the draft investigation report when it is completed.\nProvide each party with a full and fair opportunity to respond to the report in writing within seven (7) days and incorporate that response into the report\nInvestigators may choose to respond in writing in the report to the responses of the parties, and/or to share the responses between the parties for their responses, while also ensuring that reasonable limits on opportunities to comment are observed so the Investigation is not unduly delayed.\nShare the report with the Title IX Coordinator or legal counsel for review and feedback.\nProvide the final report to the Title IX Coordinator that summarizes, assesses, and synthesizes evidence without making a finding, conclusion, determination or recommendation.\nProvide the final report to the Title IX Coordinator.\n7. Determination\nWithin five (5) business days of receiving the Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s report, the Chief Accountability Officer will designate a Decision-maker to review the report, any evidence, and all responses, then make the final determination on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence. At the sole discretion of the Chief Accountability Officer, the Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s report may be provided to a team of decision-makers for review and determination.\nIf the record is incomplete, the Title IX Coordinator/Decision-maker may return the report to the Investigator for re-opening of the investigation, or may direct or conduct any additional inquiry necessary, including meeting with the parties or any witnesses, if needed.\nThe Title IX Coordinator or Decision-maker may invite and consider impact statements from the parties if and when determining appropriate sanction(s), if any.\nThe Title IX Coordinator then timely provides the parties with a written Notice of Outcome to include findings, any sanction(s), and a detailed rationale, delivered simultaneously (without undue delay) to the parties.\n8. Additional Details of the Investigation Process\na. Witness responsibilities\nWitnesses (as distinguished from the parties) who are faculty or staff of UMB are required to cooperate with and participate in UMB\xe2\x80\x99s investigation and resolution process. Failure of a witness to cooperate with and/or participate in the investigation or resolution process constitutes a violation of Policy and may be subject to discipline.\nb. Remote processes\nParties and witnesses may be interviewed remotely by phone, video conferencing, or similar technologies if the Investigator(s) or Decision-maker determine that timeliness or efficiency dictates a need for remote interviewing. Witnesses may also provide written statements in lieu of interviews, or respond to questions in writing, if deemed appropriate by the Investigator(s), though this approach is normally considered not ideal. Where remote technologies are used, UMB makes reasonable efforts to ensure privacy, and that any technology does not work to the detriment of any party or subject them to unfairness.\nc. Recording\nNo unauthorized audio or video recording of any kind is permitted during the resolution process. If Investigator(s) elect to audio and/or video record interviews, all involved parties must be made aware of and consent to audio and/or video recording.\nd. Evidence\nAny evidence that is relevant and credible may be considered, including an individual\xe2\x80\x99s prior misconduct history as well as evidence indicating a pattern of misconduct. The process should exclude irrelevant or immaterial evidence and may disregard evidence lacking in credibility or that is improperly prejudicial.\ne. Sexual history/patterns\nUnless the Title IX Coordinator determines it is appropriate, the investigation and the finding do not consider: (1) incidents not directly related to the possible violation, unless they evidence a pattern; (2) the sexual history of the parties (though there may be a limited exception made with regard to the sexual history between the parties); or (3) the character of the parties.\nf. Previous allegations/violations\nWhile previous conduct violations by the Respondent are not generally admissible as information supporting the current allegation, the Investigator(s) may supply the Title IX Coordinator with information about previous good faith allegations and/or findings, when that information suggests potential pattern and/or predatory conduct. This information will be included in the Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s Report.\nPrevious disciplinary action of any kind involving the Respondent may be considered in determining the appropriate sanction(s), if UMB uses a progressive discipline system.\ng. Character witnesses\nNeither the Title IX Coordinator nor the Investigator(s) will meet with character witnesses, but the Investigator(s) may accept up to two (2) letters supporting the character of each of the parties. Such letters must be provided to the Investigator(s) prior to the report being finalized; otherwise, the parties have waived their right to provide such letters. Any impact letters provided to the Investigator will become part of the evidentiary file.\nh. Notification of outcome\nIf the Respondent admits to the violation(s), or is found in violation, the Decision-maker, in consultation with other administrators as appropriate, determines sanction(s) and/or remedial actions, which are promptly implemented in order to effectively to stop the harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation; prevent its recurrence; and remedy the effects of the discriminatory conduct, both on the Complainant and the community. This process will include consultation with the appropriate Dean or Conduct Review Board, as applicable.\xc2\xa0 If the admission occurs prior to referral for Administrative Review, the Chief Accountability Officer will assign a Decision-maker for the purpose of determining the sanction.\nThe Title IX Coordinator informs the parties of the determination within five (5) business days of the decision, ideally simultaneously, but without significant time delay between notifications. Notifications are made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person; mailed to the local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in official UMB records; or emailed to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 UMB-issued or designated email account. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice is presumptively delivered.\nThe Notification of Outcome specifies the finding for each alleged policy violation, any sanction(s) that may result which UMB is permitted to share pursuant to state or federal law, and the rationale supporting the essential findings to the extent UMB is permitted to share the information under applicable law.\nThe notice will detail when the determination is considered final and will detail any changes that are made prior to finalization.\nUnless based on an acceptance of violation by the Respondent, the determination may be appealed by either party. The Notification of Outcome also includes the grounds on which the parties may appeal and the steps the parties may take to request an appeal of the findings. More information about the appeal procedures can be found below.\n9. Sanctions\nFactors considered when determining any sanction(s)/remedial action(s) may include, but are not limited to:\nThe nature, severity of, and circumstances surrounding the violation\nAn individual\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary history\nPrevious allegations or allegations involving similar conduct\nThe need for sanctions/remedial actions to bring an end to the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation\nThe need for sanctions/remedial actions to prevent the future recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation\nThe need to remedy the effects of the discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation on the Complainant and the community\nThe impact on the parties\nAny other information deemed relevant by the Decision-maker\nIn determining sanctions, the process will include consultation with the appropriate Dean or Conduct Review Board, as applicable.\xc2\xa0 The sanction(s) will be implemented as soon as is feasible. The sanctions described in this policy are not exclusive of, and may be in addition to, other actions taken, or sanctions imposed by outside authorities.\na. Student Sanctions/Remedial Actions\nThe following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:\nWarning: A formal statement identifying conduct that was found to be a violation and a warning that further violation of any UMB policy, procedure, or directive will result in more or potentially more severe sanctions/remedial actions.\nProbation: A written reprimand for violation of institutional policy, providing for more severe disciplinary sanctions in the event that the student or organization is found in violation of any institutional policy, procedure, or directive within a specified period of time. Terms of the probation will be articulated and may include denial of specified UMB-related social privileges, exclusion from co-curricular activities, exclusion from designated areas of campus, no-contact orders, and/or other measures deemed appropriate.\nSuspension: Termination of student status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Students who return from suspension are automatically placed on probation through the remainder of their tenure as a student at UMB.\nDismissal: Permanent termination of student status and revocation of rights to be on campus for any reason or to attend UMB-sponsored events. This sanction will be noted permanently as a Conduct Expulsion on the student\xe2\x80\x99s official transcript.\nRequired Counseling: A mandate to meet with and engage in either UMB-sponsored or external counseling to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.\nRequired Training or Education: A mandate to engage in either UMB-sponsored or external training or educational programs to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.\nWithholding Degree: UMB may withhold a student\xe2\x80\x99s degree for a specified period of time and/or deny a student participation in commencement activities if the student has an allegation pending or as a sanction if the student is found responsible for an alleged violation.\nRevocation of Degree: UMB reserves the right to revoke a degree previously awarded by UMB as a sanction if the student if found responsible for an alleged violation.\nTranscript Notation: A permanent notation on the student\xe2\x80\x99s official transcript of the policy violation.\nOther Actions: In addition to or in place of the above sanctions, UMB may assign any other sanctions as deemed appropriate.\nb. Employee Sanctions/Remedial Actions\nThe following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:\nWarning \xe2\x80\x93 Verbal or Written: A formal verbal or written statement that the conduct was unacceptable and a warning that further violation of any UMB policy, procedure, or directive will result in more severe sanctions/remedial actions.\nPerformance Improvement Plan: Inclusion of the violation on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s Performance Improvement Plan with corrective actions to be taken by the employee.\nRequired Counseling: A mandate to meet with and engage in either UMB-sponsored or external counseling to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.\nRequired Training or Education: A mandate to engage in either UMB-sponsored or external training or educational programs to better comprehend the misconduct and its effects.\nDemotion: Lowering the employee\xe2\x80\x99s status, title, and, if appropriate, pay.\nSuspension with pay: Termination of employee\xe2\x80\x99s status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Employees who return from suspension with pay are automatically placed on probation for a period to be determined at the time of suspension. The employee will continue to receive their base salary during the suspension period.\nSuspension without pay: Termination of employee\xe2\x80\x99s status for a definite period of time not to exceed two years and/or until specific criteria are met. Employees who return from suspension with pay are automatically placed on probation for a period to be determined at the time of suspension. The employee will not receive their salary during the suspension period.\nTermination: UMB will end its employment agreement with the employee. The employee will not be eligible to be re-hired by UMB.\nOther Actions: In addition to or in place of the above sanctions/remedial actions, UMB may assign any other remedial actions as deemed appropriate.\n10. Withdrawal or Resignation While Charges Pending\na. Students\nThe UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct provides the potential outcomes should a student withdrawal or resign with charges are pending.\nb. Employees\nThe UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct provides the potential outcomes should an employee resign with charges are pending.\n11. Appeals\nAll requests for appeal consideration must be submitted in writing to the Title IX Coordinator within five (5) business days of the delivery of the written finding of the Title IX Coordinator or Decision-maker. Any party may appeal the findings only under the grounds described below.\nThe President, or the President\xe2\x80\x99s designee, is appointed as the Appeal Decision-maker. Any party may appeal, but appeals are limited to the following grounds:\nA procedural error or omission occurred that significantly impacted the outcome of the hearing (e.g., substantiated bias, material deviation from established procedures, failure to correctly apply the evidentiary standard).\nTo consider new evidence, unknown or could not be made available during the investigation, and that could substantially impact the original finding or sanction. A summary of this new evidence and its potential impact must be included in the appeal.\nThe Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or Decision-maker(s) had a significant conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent, or a related interest not disclosed that materially affected the outcome of the matter.\nWhen any party requests an appeal, the Title IX Coordinator will share the appeal request with the other party(ies) or other appropriate persons such as the Investigator(s), who may file a response within five (5) business days. The other party may also bring their own appeal on separate grounds.\nIf new grounds are raised, the original appealing party will be permitted to submit a written response to these new grounds within five (5) business days. These responses or appeal requests will be shared with each party. The Appeal Decision-maker will review the appeal request(s) within seven (7) business days of completing the pre-appeal exchange of materials. If grounds are not sufficient for an appeal, or the appeal is not timely, the appeal will be dismissed.\nWhen the Appeal Decision-maker finds that at least one of the grounds is met by at least one party, additional principles governing the review of appeals include the following:\nDecisions by the Appeal Decision-maker are to be deferential to the original decision, making changes to the finding only when there is clear error and to the sanction(s)/remedial action(s) only if there is compelling justification to do so.\nAppeals are not intended to be full re-hearings (de novo) of the allegation(s). In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation or record of the investigation and pertinent documentation regarding the grounds for appeal.\nAn appeal is not an opportunity for the Appeal Decision-maker to substitute their judgment for that of the original Investigator(s) or Title IX Coordinator/Decision-maker merely because they disagree with the finding and/or sanction(s).\nAppeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the Investigator(s) for reconsideration. Other appeals should be remanded at the discretion of the Appeal Decision-maker.\nSanctions imposed as the result of Administrative Resolution are implemented immediately unless the Title IX Coordinator stays their implementation in extraordinary circumstances, pending the outcome of the appeal.\nFor students: Graduation, study abroad, internships/ externships, etc., do NOT in and of themselves constitute exigent circumstances, and students may not be able to participate in those activities during their appeal.\nAll parties will be informed in writing within (7) business days of the outcome of the appeal without significant time delay between notifications, and in accordance with the standards for Notice of Outcome as defined above.\nOnce an appeal is decided, the outcome is final; further appeals are not permitted, even if a decision or sanction is changed on remand.\nIn rare cases when a procedural [or substantive] error cannot be cured by the original Investigator(s) and/or Decision-maker (as in cases of bias), the Appeal Decision-maker may recommend a new investigation and/or Administrative Resolution process, including new resolution Decision-maker(s).\nIn cases in which the appeal results in Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reinstatement to UMB or resumption of privileges, all reasonable attempts will be made to restore the Respondent to their prior status, recognizing that some opportunities lost may be irreparable in the short term.\n12. Long-Term Remedies/Actions\nFollowing the conclusion of the resolution process, and in addition to any sanctions implemented, the Title IX Coordinator may implement long-term remedies or actions with respect to the parties and/or the campus community to stop the harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation; remedy its effects; and prevent its reoccurrence.\nThese remedies/actions may include, but are not limited to:\nReferral to counseling and health services\nReferral to the Employee Assistance Program\nEducation to the community\nPermanent alteration of housing assignments\nPermanent alteration of work arrangements for employees\nProvision of campus safety escorts\nClimate surveys\nProvision of transportation accommodations\nImplementation of long-term contact limitations between the parties\nImplementation of adjustments to academic deadlines, course schedules, etc.\nAt the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, long-term remedies may also be provided to the Complainant even if no policy violation is found.\nWhen no policy violation is found, the Title IX Coordinator will address any remedial requirements that may appropriately be made available by UMB to the Respondent.\n13. Failure to Complete Sanctions/Comply with Interim and Long-term Remedies/Remedial Actions\nAll Respondents are expected to comply with sanctions, remedial actions, and corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the Title IX Coordinator.\nFailure to abide by the sanction(s)/action(s) imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanction(s)/remedial/corrective action(s), including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination from UMB and may be noted on a student\xe2\x80\x99s official transcript.\nA suspension will only be lifted when compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.\n14. Recordkeeping\nIn implementing this policy, records of all allegations, investigations, resolutions, and hearings will be kept for a minimum of seven (7) years, or as required by state or federal law or institutional policy, by the Title IX Coordinator in the Title IX case database.\n15. Disabilities Accommodation in the Resolution Process\nUMB is committed to providing reasonable accommodations and support to qualified students, employees, or others with disabilities to ensure equal access to the UMB\xe2\x80\x99s resolution process.\nStudents needing such accommodations or support should complete the Disability and Reasonable Accommodations form located on the Educational Support and Disability Services website located at: https://www.umaryland.edu/disabilityservices/for-students/how-to-request-accommodations/.\xc2\xa0 Employees should complete the Request for Reasonable Accommodation form and submitting it to Human Resource Services (HRS) Employee Labor Relations (ELR), Office of Diversity, ADA and Affirmative Action located at https://www.umaryland.edu/hrs/current-employees/diversity-ada-aa/americans-with-disabilities-act/. Students and employees seeking accommodations or support should inform the Title IX Coordinator when they have submitted the request(s) to allow for consultation to determine which accommodations are appropriate and necessary for full participation in the process.\n16. Revision\nThese procedures will be reviewed and updated annually by the Title IX Coordinator. UMB reserves the right to make changes to this document as necessary and once those changes are posted online, they are in effect.\nThe Title IX Coordinator may make minor modifications to these procedures that do not materially jeopardize the fairness owed to any party, such as to accommodate summer schedules.\nThe Title IX Coordinator may also vary procedures materially with notice (in the Policy and Procedures section of UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX website located at\xc2\xa0https://www.umaryland.edu/titleix/policies-and-procedures/\xc2\xa0, with the appropriate effective date identified) upon determining that changes to law or regulation require policy or procedural alterations not reflected in this procedure.\nAt the discretion of UMB, Policy in effect at the time of the offense will apply even if the policy is changed subsequently but prior to resolution, unless the parties consent to be bound by the current policy.\nIf government regulations change in a way that impacts this document, this document will be construed to comply with the most recent government regulations.\nThis document does not create legally enforceable protections beyond the protection of the background state and federal laws which frame such policies and codes, generally.\nTHESE PROCEDURES WERE ADAPTED FROM ATIXA 2020 ONE POLICY, TWO PROCEDURES MODEL\nUSE AND ADAPTATION OF THIS MODEL WITH CITATION TO ATIXA IS PERMITTED\nTHROUGH A LIMITED LICENSE\nTO UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE\nALL OTHER RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\xc2\xa92020.

Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures\nAdministration\n|\nApproved October 9, 2012\nResponsible VP/AVP\nRoger Ward, EdD, JD, MSL, MPA\nRevision History\nApproved by the President, November 6, 1997; Amended October 9, 2012\xc2\xa0[nondiscrimination definition, per USM VI 1.05]\nPurpose Background\nEffective July 11, 1997, the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland specifically prohibited discrimination against students on the basis of sexual orientation in academic admissions, financial aid, educational services, housing, student programs and activities and recruitment. Effective June 22, 2012, the Board of Regents prohibited discrimination based upon sexual identity or expression. The Board reserved the right to enforce or comply with any Federal or State law, regulation, or guideline, including conditions for the receipt of federal funding. This University reiterates its commitment to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity by requiring that treatment of its students and applicants for admission be based on individual abilities and qualifications and be free from invidious discrimination.\nPolicy Statement Related Employment Policy\nUniversity students who are also University employees should be aware of the Employee Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Procedures.\nPolicy\nConsistent with Board of Regents policy, it is this University's policy that (a) within the University, the educational environment will be free of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and (b) University students are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation against fellow students, University personnel, and other persons with whom the students interact during the course of their educational experiences both on and off campus. Students may be disciplined for violation of this policy.\nProcedures\nA student's questions about peer, staff or faculty behavior that may constitute discrimination based on sexual orientation and a student's questions about disciplinary policies should be directed to the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs in the UMB Office of Academic Affairs (\xe2\x80\x9cAVPSA\xe2\x80\x9d), (410) 706-2477 or, to the campus Director of Employee Relations and Diversity Initiatives, at 410-706-7302, or to the student affairs dean of the student's school.\nA complaint of discrimination based on sexual orientation may be made initially to the dean of the complaining student's school, to the appropriate student or school judicial board of the complaining student's school, or to the AVPSA. The AVPSA should be notified of any complaint filed with another office. Investigation of complaints will be made through appropriate school judicial bodies whenever feasible. If a complaint involves persons from more than one school, the AVPSA will work with the deans of the schools involved to develop an appropriate investigational process.\nTo determine whether alleged conduct constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the University will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances. The determination of whether a particular action is discrimination will be made from all the facts, on a case by case basis.\nTimely reporting of allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation is crucial. It permits effective University\xc2\xa0intervention to protect students and educate and discipline offenders. Incidents of discrimination should be documented promptly and reported as soon as practical. Reporting within the time limits set in a school's judicial policy is strongly encouraged. Reporting an incident of discrimination more than thirty (30) days after it occurs can hinder the ability of the school and institution to investigate the matter. Nevertheless, the school and institution will investigate any complaint filed within a reasonable time.\nInstitutional investigations of discrimination based on sexual orientation charges often require the complainant's identity to be known by the accused. However, complainants should be aware that the University will not tolerate or condone any form of retaliation against a student complainant whose discrimination claim is made in good faith. Deliberate filing of false accusations may be the basis for independent disciplinary action against the accuser.\nComplaints Involving Affiliates' Employees\nMany University students will be supervised by employees of the University's affiliates and teaching sites during their educational experiences. If a student experiences discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in such a setting, the University will attempt to resolve the issue, and will attempt to reassign the student if a resolution is not feasible.\nCounseling\nThe Counseling Center offers assistance in coping with the stress resulting from discrimination based on sexual orientation or participation in campus proceedings to investigate such discrimination charges. Please call 410-328-8404 for more information about campus counseling services.\nEducational Programs\nPrograms for students about discrimination based on sexual orientation can be arranged through the AVPSA, the student affairs dean of each school, or the Director of Employee Relations and Diversity Initiatives.\nDefinitions Sexual orientation is the identification, perception, or status of an individual as to homosexuality, heterosexuality, or\xc2\xa0bisexuality.\nGender identity or expression is defined as a person\xe2\x80\x99s actual or perceived gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression, regardless of whether that identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the person\xe2\x80\x99s gender at birth.\nRelated Policies\nUSM Policy on Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity\nRelated Procedures\nReporting Through The UMB Hotline\nFill out my online form.\nThe University of Maryland, Baltimore is the founding campus of the University System of Maryland.  620 W.

Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures\nAdministration\n|\nApproved October 9, 2012\nResponsible VP/AVP\nRoger Ward, EdD, JD, MSL, MPA\nRevision History\nApproved by President, November 6, 1997; Amended October 9, 2012\xc2\xa0[nondiscrimination definition, per USM VI 1.05]\nPurpose Background\nEffective July 11, 1997, the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland specifically prohibited discrimination against faculty and staff on the basis of sexual orientation in recruitment, hiring, employment, appointment, promotion, tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff or termination, rates of pay, selection for training and professional development, and employee services. Effective June 22, 2012, the Board of Regents prohibited discrimination based upon sexual identity or expression. The Board reserved the right to observe the terms of any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, and to enforce or comply with any Federal or State law, regulation, or guideline, including conditions for the receipt of federal funding. This University reiterates its commitment to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity by requiring that treatment of its faculty and staff and applicants for employment be based on individual abilities and qualifications and be free from invidious discrimination.\nPolicy Statement Related Student Policy\nFaculty and staff who interact with students should be aware of the Student Sexual Orientation NonDiscrimination Procedures.\nPolicy\nConsistent with Board of Regents policy, this University will not discriminate against faculty or staff on the basis of sexual orientation in recruitment, hiring, employment, appointment, promotion, tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff or termination, rates of pay, selection for training and professional development, and employee services.\nComplaints and Investigations\nComplaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation by a University employee may be processed internally (a) by classified staff, associate staff and faculty, by reporting the matter to the Executive Director, Human Resource Services, for investigation, mediation, and referral for supervisory action; and/or (b) by classified and associate staff employees, by filing grievances through the University's grievance process; and/or (c) by faculty, by filing grievances with the head of the academic unit in which the complaining faculty member is appointed.\nTimely reporting of allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation is crucial and permits effective University intervention. Complaints should be filed within thirty (30) days of an incident perceived as discrimination. Reporting an incident more than thirty (30) days after it occurs can hinder the ability of the University to investigate the matter. Prompt filing of complaints in many cases will enable the University to investigate and attempt to mediate and resolve problems in an expeditious manner. Nevertheless, the University will investigate any and all complaints filed within a reasonable time.\nTo determine whether alleged conduct constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the University will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances. The determination of whether a particular action is discrimination will be made from all the facts, on a case by case basis.\nInvestigations of alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation often require the complainant's identity to be known by the party or parties whose conduct is being reviewed. However, the investigation shall be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible with the allegations made available only to those who need to know.\nThe University will not tolerate or condone any form of retaliation against a complainant whose discrimination claim is made in good faith. Deliberate filing of false accusations may be the basis for independent disciplinary action against the accuser.\nComplaints Involving Affiliates' Employees\nMany University employees are obligated to work with, supervise, or be supervised by employees of the University's affiliates and teaching sites (e.g., University of Maryland Medical System Corporation, University Physicians, Inc., faculty professional associations, Veterans' Administration Medical Center). It is the University's policy to attempt to secure for its employees in all settings a work environment free of discrimination based on sexual orientation. University employees are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation against employees of affiliates, and such discrimination may be the basis for disciplinary action.\nThe University's affiliates will be informed of the University's commitment to its employees to provide a workplace free of discrimination based on sexual orientation and will be asked to work with the University to eliminate such discrimination within their respective workplaces through education and, if need be, employee sanctions. The University cannot discipline employees of its affiliates, but the University will cooperate with its affiliates in an attempt to resolve complaints.\nUniversity employees, affiliates, and affiliates' employees are encouraged to report to the University, through Employee Relations and Diversity Initiatives, Human Resource Services, any allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation involving interactions of University employees and employees of affiliates. Employees of affiliates should be aware that their complaints involving University employees should be filed with their own employer as well as with the University. Likewise, University employees should file complaints involving affiliates' employees with the University as well as with the affiliates.\nPersonal Counseling and Employee Assistance\nEmployees of the University are encouraged to work with the Employee Assistance Program (410-328-5860) or personal counselors to secure assistance in coping with stress that can result from employment-related discrimination based on sexual orientation or from participation in investigation of complaints based on sexual orientation.\nEducation and Consultations\nThrough Human Resource Services, educational programs and preventive consultations with employees can be arranged. More information is available from Employee/Labor Relations and Diversity Initiatives, 410-706-7302.\nDefinitions Sexual orientation is the identification, perception, or status of an individual as to homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.\nGender identity or expression is defined as a person\xe2\x80\x99s actual or perceived gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression, regardless of whether that identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the person\xe2\x80\x99s gender at birth.\nRelated Policies\nUSM Policy on Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity\nRelated Procedures\nReporting Through The UMB Hotline\nFill out my online form.\nThe University of Maryland, Baltimore is the founding campus of the University System of Maryland.  620 W.

Concerning Consensual Relationships\nHuman Resources\n|\nApproved July 15, 2019\nResponsible VP/AVP\nDawn M. Rhodes, DBA, MBA\nPurpose The purpose of this Policy is to minimize the risk of conflicts of interest arising from consensual relationships with subordinates or students, promote fairness, and protect all members of the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) community from instances of real or perceived sexual harassment that may result from consensual relationships between UMB personnel and subordinates or students.\nSCOPE: This Policy applies to all members of the UMB community (paid and unpaid), including all staff, faculty, students, and trainees.\nPolicy Statement I. Prohibited Conduct of Persons in Consensual Relationships\nA. Supervisors and Subordinates. No member of the UMB community in a leadership, management or supervisory position shall have a consensual romantic, dating, or sexual relationship with a subordinate he or she directly supervises or evaluates, or whose terms or conditions of employment he or she controls directly or indirectly. Terms and conditions of employment include promotion, renewal of appointments or contracts, termination, discipline, compensation, and work assignments.\nB. Relationships with Students or Trainees. No member of the UMB community shall have a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship with a student or trainee whom he or she teaches, grades, evaluates, manages, supervises, or advises in any way.\nC. Professional Conduct. Consensual relationships must not interfere with any employee's or student\xe2\x80\x99s professionalism. Sexual relations and sexual contact are strictly prohibited in workplace or academic facilities. Individuals in leadership, management, or supervisory positions are expected to conduct themselves with a high standard of professionalism in their workplace and social interactions with subordinates or students.\nII. Disclosure Requirements and Exceptions\nThe University recognizes that some relationships subject to this Policy may already exist, and that others may come into existence in ways that are not the result of a conflict of interest or sexual harassment. For example, reporting relationships may change due to promotions, transfers, school enrollment, graduations, etc. An individual who has a relationship with a member of the UMB community that is addressed by this Policy is required to disclose the relationship in writing to the Chief Accountability Officer (\xe2\x80\x9cCAO\xe2\x80\x9d) as soon as practical. Upon disclosure of the relationship, the individual may propose an acceptable alternative arrangement for the CAO\xe2\x80\x99s consideration.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAcceptable alternative arrangement\xe2\x80\x9d means an arrangement that removes any supervisory or evaluation responsibilities between the individuals or an individual\xe2\x80\x99s control over the terms and conditions of employment of the subordinate individual involved in the relationship. An acceptable alternative arrangement should avoid negative consequences for the individual in the subordinate role. An individual may request an exception to this Policy from the CAO if an acceptable alternative arrangement is not feasible.\nThe CAO will consider and may modify a proposal for an acceptable alternative arrangement or grant an exception to this Policy. UMB retains discretion in its enforcement of this Policy and in the approval of acceptable alternative arrangements or exceptions.\nIndividuals who engage in prohibited consensual relationships (i.e., who do not disclose relationships covered by this Policy to the CAO and do not seek approval of and implement an acceptable alternative arrangement, or secure an exception to this Policy) are in violation of this Policy. Supervisors, including faculty supervisors, who obtain information that would lead a reasonable person to believe that this Policy has been violated, should report the alleged violation to the CAO.\nIII. Investigation, Corrective Action, and Discipline\nA. Alleged violations of this Policy, including concerns of conflicts of interest, will be investigated by the CAO or designee.\nB. A relationship covered by this Policy may result in the removal of a management or supervisory employee from his or her position or a reorganization of the reporting or academic relationship so that no conflict of interest exists.\nC. Violations of this Policy or failure to adhere to an approved alternative arrangement or conditions of an exception may result in disciplinary action. Disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment, will be considered as warranted by the circumstances and consistent with relevant University policies and procedures.\nIV. Non-discrimination.\nDecisions made under this Policy will be made based on operational, academic and business considerations and without regard to sex, race, color, religion, creed, age (40 and over), national origin, citizenship, physical or mental disability, military service or application, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, or any other protected characteristic under federal or Maryland law.\nDownloads RELATED POLICIES:\nII-4.00(A) Faculty Grievance Policy and Procedure\nVI-1.60(A) UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct\nVII-8.00(A) Guidelines and Procedures on Grievances for Exempt and Nonexempt Staff Employees\nRelated Policies\nUMB Faculty Grievance Policy and Procedure\nUMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct\nUMB Guidelines and Procedures on Grievances for Exempt and Nonexempt Staff Employees\nUSM Policy on Employment of Members of the Same Family (Nepotism)\nRelated Procedures\nReporting Through The UMB Hotline\nFill out my online form.\nThe University of Maryland, Baltimore is the founding campus of the University System of Maryland.  620 W.
