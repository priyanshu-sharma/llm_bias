Sexual Misconduct\nAdministration\n|\nApproved August 14, 2020\nResponsible VP/AVP\nSusan C. Buskirk, DM, MS\nRevision History\nApproved by the President March 30, 2015, replaced V1-1.30(A), to comply with USM V1-1.60 (eff. June 27, 2014, revised June 19, 2015); Revised August 26, 2015; Revised August 14, 2020; Revised March 24, 2023 to update links.\nPolicy Statement I. PURPOSE\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore (\xe2\x80\x9cUMB\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cInstitution\xe2\x80\x9d) is committed to providing a learning and working environment free from Sexual Misconduct, as defined in Section III of this Policy.\xc2\xa0 UMB prohibits and will not tolerate Sexual Misconduct. Sexual Misconduct is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by state and federal laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 as amended (\xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX\xe2\x80\x9d) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and some forms of Sexual Misconduct may constitute criminal activity. UMB endeavors to foster a climate free from Sexual Misconduct through training, education, prevention programs, and policies and procedures that promote prompt reporting, prohibit retaliation, and promote timely, fair, and impartial investigation and resolution of Sexual Misconduct cases in a manner that eliminates the Sexual Misconduct, prevents its reoccurrence, and addresses its effects.\nII. SCOPE\nA. Applicability and Jurisdiction\nAll students, faculty, and staff, as well as third parties and contractors under UMB control, are subject to this Policy regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. This Policy applies to Sexual Misconduct in connection with any UMB educational program or activity, including Sexual Misconduct (1) in any UMB facility or on any UMB property; (2) in connection with any UMB sponsored, recognized or approved program, visit, or activity, regardless of location and inclusive of the online environment; (3) that impedes equal access to any UMB educational program or activity or adversely effects the employment of a member of the UMB community; or (4) that otherwise threatens the health or safety of a member of the UMB community. Nothing in this Policy is intended to supersede or conflict with any federal compliance obligation.\nFederal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) require that UMB implement certain procedures when UMB obtains Actual Knowledge of Sexual Harassment in its Education Programs or Activities against a person in the United States. UMB will address all allegations to determine whether the conduct occurred in the context of its employment or educational program or activity and/or has continuing effects on the campus or in an off-campus UMB program or activity, violating UMB policy. Prohibited Sexual Misconduct that violates UMB policy that does not fall under the scope of Title IX either because it occurs outside the United States or because it does not fall within Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s definition of Sexual Harassment will be addressed using alternate processes as more fully described in UMB\xe2\x80\x99s procedures.\nIf the Respondent is unknown or is not a member of the UMB community, the Title IX Coordinator will assist the Complainant (and the reporting party if someone other than the alleged victim has reported the Sexual Misconduct) in identifying appropriate campus and local resources and support options. UMB may take other actions as appropriate, such as barring a third party from UMB property and/or events. When the Respondent is enrolled in or employed by another USM institution, the Title IX Coordinator can assist in liaising with the appropriate individual for that institution and, in some instances, may make a report to the institution, as the alleged conduct may be prohibited by that school\xe2\x80\x99s policies. Similarly, the Title IX Coordinator may be able to provide support to a student or employee who reports discrimination in an externship, study abroad program, or other environment external to UMB.\nB. Protection of Minors\nIn Maryland, a person under the age of 16 years cannot consent to sexual activity. This means that sexual contact by an individual over the age of 18 with a person younger than 16 years old may be a crime, could require an immediate report to the applicable child welfare agency and/or local law enforcement agency, and represents a potential violation of this Policy, even if the minor appeared to welcome the sexual activity. See UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Procedures for Reporting Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect (VI-1.50(A)) for mandatory requirements for Sexual Misconduct that includes a minor.\nC. Academic Freedom\nThis Policy is not meant to inhibit or prohibit educational content or discussions inside or outside of the classroom that include controversial or sensitive subject matters protected by academic freedom.\nD. Guidance\nUMB encourages those who are unsure whether a situation is controlled by this Policy to ask questions and seek advice through the Title IX Office or the Consultation Line, available at https://www.umaryland.edu/oac/consult-with-us/.\nIII. DEFINITIONS\nA. Actual Knowledge\nUMB will have actual knowledge that a violation of this Policy may have occurred when notice of the alleged violation is given to an Official with Authority to take corrective action. A report to the Title IX Coordinator or designee or received through UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Hotline is sufficient to provide UMB with actual knowledge.\nB. Advisor\nAdvisor means a person chosen by a party or appointed by the institution to accompany the party to meetings related to the resolution process, to advise the party on that process, and to conduct cross-examination for the party at the hearing, if any.\nC. Complainant\nAn individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that is in violation of this Policy.\nD. Confidential Employees\nEmployees of UMB who, in relation to the services being provided on behalf of the institution, have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential. A list of these individuals is listed in Section VI.C.4.\nE. Consent\nA knowing, voluntary, and affirmatively communicated willingness to mutually participate in a particular sexual activity or behavior.\xc2\xa0 Consent must be given by a person with the ability and capacity to exercise free will and make a rational and reasonable judgment. Consent may be expressed either by affirmative words or actions, as long as those words or actions create a mutually understandable permission regarding the conditions of sexual activity. Consent may be withdrawn at any time. Consent cannot be obtained by force, threat, coercion, fraud, manipulation, reasonable fear of injury, intimidation, or by using one\xe2\x80\x99s mental or physical helplessness or incapacity. Consent cannot be implied based on the mere fact of a previous consensual dating or sexual relationship. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another.\nIf a person is incapacitated, which is to be deprived of their capacity or natural power, they are not able to make rational decisions and, therefore, cannot consent to sexual activity. Incapacity will be evaluated using a reasonable person standard, e.g., would a reasonable person believe the person is/was unable to consent.\xc2\xa0 Incapacitation can be caused by the consumption of alcohol, but a person who is \xe2\x80\x9cdrunk\xe2\x80\x9d or intoxicated\xe2\x80\x9d may or may not be incapacitated; incapacitation can also be the result of being drugged, unconscious, sleep-deprived and/or ill.\nF. Dating Violence\nViolence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s statement, with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\nG. Domestic Violence\nA felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred; or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person\xe2\x80\x99s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Maryland or the jurisdiction in which the crime or violence occurred.\nH. Education Program or Activity\nIncludes locations, events, or circumstances over which UMB has or does exercise substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by UMB.\nI. Emergency Removal\nRemoval of a party from UMB\xe2\x80\x99s program or activity on an emergency basis, provided UMB has undertaken an individualized safety and risk analysis, determined that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual harassment justifies removal, and provided the respondent with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.\nJ. Formal Complaint\nA document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment by a Respondent and requesting that UMB investigate the allegation of sexual harassment. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator.\nK. Hearing Decision-maker\nDecision-maker refers to the individual(s) who have decision-making and sanctioning authority within UMB\xe2\x80\x99s formal grievance process.\nL. Hearing Panelist\nIndividuals who serve on hearing panels within UMB\xe2\x80\x99s formal grievance process.\nM.

Non-confidential Employees\nEmployees of UMB who do not have a professional or legal obligation to keep communications confidential as listed in Section VI.C.4.\nO. Official with Authority\nAny official of UMB with authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the institution.\nP.

Respondent\nA person who has been accused of violating this Policy.\nR. Retaliation\nIntimidating, threatening, coercing, or discriminating against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, USM or UMB policy relating to Sexual Misconduct, or because an individual has made a report, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to Sexual Misconduct.

Supportive Measures\nSupportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the Complainant or the Respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment.\nIV. TITLE IX COMPLIANCE AND OVERSIGHT\nTitle IX Coordinator\nUMB\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator oversees and coordinates UMB\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with all aspects of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, all associated regulations promulgated under Title IX, and this Policy. The Title IX Coordinator is housed in the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC):\nStephanie Suerty, MPA, CCEPActing Title IX CoordinatorDirector, Special Projects\xc2\xa0Office of Accountability & Compliance\xc2\xa0410-706-5212\xc2\xa0titleixcompliance@umaryland.edu\nThe Title IX Coordinator acts to ensure that all UMB representatives involved in the investigation, resolution, and disciplinary processes act with objectivity and impartiality. Where the Title IX Coordinator determines that a UMB representative poses a conflict of interest or bias, the Title IX Coordinator shall recuse that person(s) from the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes. Concerns of bias or a potential conflict of interest by any other administrator involved in the investigation, resolution, adjudication, and disciplinary processes should be raised with the Title IX Coordinator.\nThe Title IX Coordinator is responsible for receiving complaints or reports of conduct that could constitute sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managing the Title IX Program, including the informal and formal grievance processes, and ensuring effective implementation of any remedies determined through UMB\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process.\nReports of misconduct or discrimination committed by the Title IX Coordinator, or concerns regarding potential bias or conflict of interest by the Title IX Coordinator, should be made to UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Accountability Officer and Vice President, Dr. Susan Buskirk; or through the UMB Hotline.\nV. POLICY EXPECTATIONS\nA. Prohibitions Against Sex and Gender-based Discrimination\nUMB adheres to all federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination in public institutions of higher education. Specifically, Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in UMB programs and activities.\nUMB does not discriminate, or tolerate discrimination, against any employee, applicant for employment, student, or applicant for admission on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.\xc2\xa0 Sex and Gender-based Discrimination is prohibited.\nThis Policy includes Sex and Gender-based Discrimination in both employment and access to educational opportunities, and access to services and programs provided by UMB.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, any member of the UMB community who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational or employment access and/or opportunities of any member of the UMB community, guest, or visitor on the basis of sex or gender in violation of federal and state laws and regulations is in violation of this Policy. UMB's prohibitions on discrimination extend to its admissions and hiring processes. UMB will take steps to eliminate prohibited conduct, prevent its reoccurrence, and remedy its effects.\nB. Prohibition Against Sexual Misconduct\nUMB does not tolerate Sexual Misconduct of or by any employee, affiliate, volunteer, student, visitor, contractor, or guest. UMB will act to remedy all forms of Sexual Misconduct.\nUMB reserves the right to address offensive conduct and/or harassment not prohibited by this Policy, for example, harassment that does not rise to the level of creating a hostile environment, or is of a generic nature not based on sex or gender. Such conduct may be referred for alternative review and resolution by the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC) to other departments as appropriate, including to Human Resources Services (HRS) for human resource related violations and to Deans or their designees for student code of conduct violations.\nVI. REPORTING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT\nA. Reporting Policy Violations to UMB\nAny person may report Sexual Harassment (whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment).\n1. Employees\nAll UMB Non-Confidential Employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct which they believe may be a violation of this Policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority.\xc2\xa0 Failure of a Non-Confidential Employee to report an incident or incidents of Sexual Misconduct of which they become aware is a violation of this Policy and the violator could be subject to disciplinary action.\nNo employee (other than UMB Police) is authorized to investigate or resolve reports of prohibited conduct without the involvement of the Title IX Coordinator.\n2. Students\nAll UMB students are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.\n3. Third Parties\nThird Parties (e.g., contractors, visitors, etc.) are encouraged to report actual or suspected violations of this Policy.\nB. Privacy and Confidentiality\n1. UMB is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of information of all individuals involved in a Sexual Misconduct matter.\xc2\xa0 Privacy and confidentiality have distinct meanings under this Policy.\nPrivacy generally means that information related to a report of Sexual Misconduct will be shared only with those UMB employees with a \xe2\x80\x9cneed to know\xe2\x80\x9d the information in order to assist in the review, investigation, or resolution of the report.\xc2\xa0 Although not bound by confidentiality, these employees will make every effort to protect the privacy interests of all individuals, consistent with due process requirements and the need for a thorough review.\nConfidentiality means that the information shared with professionals who have been designated by UMB as confidential resources cannot be revealed to any other person without the express permission of the individual who shared the information with the professional.\xc2\xa0 These designated professionals are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.\n2. Reporting Party\xe2\x80\x99s Request for Confidentiality\nAn individual who wishes to discuss a Sexual Misconduct matter confidentially may do so by speaking with a professional who has a legal duty to maintain confidentiality.\xc2\xa0 Confidential resources for UMB students and employees are listed in Section VI.C.4., below.\xc2\xa0 Information shared with these resources will not be shared with anyone without the individual\xe2\x80\x99s express permission, unless maintaining such confidentiality would result in imminent physical harm to the individual or other individuals.\xc2\xa0 When a report involves suspected abuse of a minor, applicable laws and UMB policies require reporting to child protective services and/or local law enforcement.\n3. Reporting Party\xe2\x80\x99s Request for Privacy\nIf a Complainant or other reporting party does want their name to be shared, does not want an investigation to take place, or does not want a formal resolution to be pursued, they may make such a request to the Title IX Coordinator, who will evaluate the request along with various considerations, including risks to members of the UMB community and legal requirements. UMB will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with a request for privacy or a request not to pursue an investigation.\xc2\xa0 Where UMB is unable to take action consistent with the request of the Complainant or reporting party, the Title IX Coordinator will inform them about UMB\xe2\x80\x99s chosen course of action.\n4. Timely Warning\nIf a report of Sexual Misconduct discloses a serious or continuing threat to the UMB community, UMB may issue a campus-wide timely warning to protect the health or safety of the UMB community.

MEDICAL ATTENTION\nMercy Medical Center is the designated treatment center for sexual assault and domestic violence in Baltimore City where victims of sexual assault (aged 13 and older) may obtain a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE), including Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A police report is not required in order to obtain an exam, which can be conducted up to five (5) days after an assault. Medical attention is recommended even if more than five (5) days have passed since the assault occurred.\nMercy Medical Center Emergency Room345 St. Paul PlaceBaltimore, Maryland 21202410-332-9494https://bmoresafemercy.org/for-patients/\nUMB Title IX personnel are available to promptly assist anyone experiencing sex- or gender-based violence, including sexual assault, in obtaining medical attention, including providing transportation to the nearest designated SAFE hospital.\nInformation on Maryland SAFE programs located outside Baltimore City is included in Section XIV. Resources, below.\nVIII. AMNESTY\nUMB encourages the reporting of Sexual Misconduct by victims and witnesses.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, victims or witnesses are hesitant to report misconduct or participate in resolution processes because they fear that they themselves may be accused of policy violations.\xc2\xa0 It is in the best interest of the UMB community for victims and witnesses to report misconduct.\xc2\xa0 To encourage reporting, UMB offers amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.\nIf the behavior was a violation of the drug or alcohol policy, and UMB is not required by law to intervene or report, UMB will offer amnesty if the violation occurred reasonably during or near the time of the alleged Sexual Misconduct, the person reported or is cooperating with UMB\xe2\x80\x99s investigation in good faith, and the behavior did not put another individual\xe2\x80\x99s health or safety at risk.\nUMB encourages community members to assist victims during or after an incident when it is safe to do so, and offers training in bystander intervention.\xc2\xa0 For students who offer help to others in need, UMB pursues a policy of amnesty from minor policy violations related to the incident.\nIX. THE RESOLUTION PROCESS\nUpon receipt by the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority of an allegation or notice of an alleged violation of the Policy, UMB initiates its resolution process, which involves a prompt preliminary review to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe this Policy has been violated.\nThe Title IX Coordinator will initiate communication with the Complainant to offer Supportive Measures and determine if the Complainant wishes to file a Formal Complaint.\xc2\xa0 Upon receipt of a Formal Complaint, the parties will be provided with written notice of the allegations, UMB\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process, including formal and informal resolution processes, the right of an Advisor of the party\xe2\x80\x99s choice, and UMB\xe2\x80\x99s policies regarding knowingly making false statements or submitting false information.\nUMB will investigate allegations in a Formal Complaint.\xc2\xa0 Any allegations that do not constitute an allegation of Sexual Harassment as defined in Section III.W, did not occur in UMB\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, will be dismissed for purposes of a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment under Title IX; such a dismissal does not preclude UMB from taking action under this Policy, UMB\xe2\x80\x99s Code of Ethics and Conduct or other relevant policies.\nUMB\xe2\x80\x99s investigatory process assumes the responsibility to ensure that the burden of proof and the burden of gathering sufficient evidence to reach a determination is borne by UMB. During the investigation process, the parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses, including fact and expert witness, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.\xc2\xa0 Neither party will be restricted from discussing the allegations or gathering and presenting relevant evidence.\nTo the extent allegations fall within the scope of Title IX, at the conclusion of the investigation, adjudication of the allegations will occur through a live hearing.\xc2\xa0 During the hearing, as more fully described in the Procedures, each party, through their Advisor, will have the opportunity to question and cross-examine the other party and any witnesses.\xc2\xa0 Live hearings may be conducted with the parties located in separate rooms/locations with technology enabling the decision-maker(s), panelists, and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. For parties that do not have an advisor, UMB will provide an Advisor of its choice, who may or may not be an attorney, for the purposes of conducting such questioning and cross-examination. An audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of the live hearing will be made available to the parties for inspection and review.\xc2\xa0 A Determination will be made by the Decision-maker and a written Determination report will be provided to the parties simultaneously.\nTo the extent allegations fall partially within the scope of Title IX and partially within the scope of other policies, UMB may bifurcate matters.\nThe parties may appeal a Determination, or any dismissal of a Formal Complaint, on the following grounds:\nProcedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;\nNew evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal of the Formal Complaint was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; and\nThe Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.\nIn order to make a determination of whether or not a policy violation occurred, UMB uses the \xe2\x80\x9cpreponderance of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d standard, that is, whether it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred.\nThe investigation and subsequent resolution processes determine whether the Policy has been violated. If it is determined that a policy violation occurred, UMB will promptly implement effective remedies designed to end the discrimination, prevent its reoccurrence, and address its effects.\nUpon the freely given consent of both parties, an informal resolution process may be chosen in lieu of the formal process of investigation and adjudication.\xc2\xa0 For those parties that agree to an Informal Process, UMB will provide a written notice of the allegation, the requirements for participation in the Informal Resolution process, the right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution process at any time before a resolution is agreed upon, and the potential consequences that may result from participating in the Informal Resolution process. Where there is an allegation of Sexual Misconduct committed by an employee against a student, the Informal Resolution process will not be offered as an option.\nUMB prohibits the use of mediation to resolve policy violations where the Sexual Misconduct includes stalking, sexual assault, or sexual coercion.\nA. Advisors\nComplainants and Respondents may have an advisor of their choice attend with them all meetings and interviews within the resolution process, if they so choose.\nWhere a matter falls within the scope of Title IX such that a live hearing is required, Complainants and Respondents must have an advisor when a formal process is initiated and these advisors will be responsible for questioning witnesses during the live hearing of the grievance process. Each party may select whomever they wish for this role if the person(s) is eligible and available, i.e., is not a party or witness in the process and is not a minor. Examples of advisors include a licensed attorney, an advocate who is supervised by a licensed attorney, or a trained advocate. In addition, as necessary, a translator will be made available upon request of a party.\nThe advisor may attend meetings or interviews with the party.\xc2\xa0 The advisor must attend any hearings and will be required to conduct any cross-examination on behalf of the party they are advising.\xc2\xa0 The advisor may offer private consultations with the party during hearings, meetings, and interviews, except during questioning of the party.\xc2\xa0 Parties may request, through the Title IX Coordinator, to have more than one Advisor.\xc2\xa0 The decision to grant this request is at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and will be granted equitably to all parties.\nA current or former UMB student who makes a complaint or who responds to a complaint on which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and who was enrolled as a student at UMB at the time of the incident that is the basis of the complaint may obtain legal counsel through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (the \xe2\x80\x9cCommission\xe2\x80\x9d). The Commission has developed a list of attorneys and legal services programs willing to represent students on a pro bono basis or at reduced fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation. The student may select an attorney on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s list or seek an alternate attorney to whom the Commission will pay reasonable fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys under civil legal services programs.\xc2\xa0 Any fees above and beyond those paid under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland Legal Services Corporation are the responsibility of the student. The Commission will not pay attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for representation of a student in any criminal or civil matter or any administrative matter that is not a Title IX proceeding at an institution operating in Maryland. See https://mhec.maryland.gov/Pages/Title-IX-Campus-Sexual-Assault-Proceedings.aspx.\nB. Timeliness\nUMB will make a good faith effort to complete the resolution process, including any appeal, within a sixty (60) calendar day time period, which can be extended as necessary by the Title IX Coordinator, with notice to the parties.\nUMB may undertake a short delay in its investigation (several days to weeks) and resolution process if circumstances require. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the need for language assistance, the absence of parties and/or witnesses, and/or accommodation for disabilities or health conditions. UMB will communicate in writing the anticipated duration of the delay and reason to the parties and provide the parties with status updates if necessary. UMB will promptly resume its investigation and resolution process as soon as feasible. During such a delay, UMB will implement Supportive Measures as deemed appropriate. Institutional action(s) are not precluded on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the underlying incident(s) have been filed or that criminal charges have been dismissed or reduced.\nC. Withdrawal or Resignation During Resolution Process\nStudents: Should a student decide not to participate in the process, the process will proceed to an appropriate resolution.\nShould a student Respondent permanently withdraw from the Institution, the process will end, as the Institution no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former student. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that have contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct. The student who withdraws or leaves while the process is pending may not return to UMB and a hold will be placed on their ability to be readmitted. If the student withdraws or takes leave for a specified period of time (e.g., one semester or term), the process will continue and that student will not be permitted to return to UMB unless and until the process is concluded and, where applicable, any sanctions have been satisfied. During the process, UMB may put a hold on a Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s transcript or place a note on a Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s transcript or dean\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary certification that a disciplinary matter is pending.\nEmployees: Should an employee Respondent resign from employment with unresolved allegations pending, the resolution process ends, as UMB no longer has disciplinary jurisdiction over the former employee. However, UMB will continue to address and remedy any systemic issues, variables that contributed to the alleged violation(s), and any ongoing effects of the alleged misconduct.\nX. SUPPORTIVE MEASURES\nIndividuals involved in reported Sexual Misconduct may be entitled to Supportive Measures.\xc2\xa0 In some instances, Supportive Measures such as no-contact orders, may extend beyond the conclusion of informal or formal resolution of a complaint.\xc2\xa0 Supportive Measures are not sanctions.\nSupportive Measures, may include, but are not limited to, the following:\ncounseling\nnotification of the appropriate administrative authorities regarding possible absences from employment or academic program\nextensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments\narrangements for alternative academic, living, or employment situations, if such alternative is available and feasible\nmodifications to work or class schedules, building access points, parking lot assignments, and other similar logistics, including increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus\ndevelopment of a mutual no-contact order (or a no-trespass order against a non-affiliated third party)\nAny request(s) for Supportive Measures should be made to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact the appropriate UMB personnel to coordinate and implement Supportive Measures.\nXI. SANCTIONS\nSanctions may be imposed upon any member of the UMB community determined to have violated this Policy. The following are examples of remedial responses and sanctions that may be recommended singly or in combination:\nA. Student Remediations and Sanctions\nWarning\nProbation\nSuspension\nDismissal\nRequired Counseling\nRequired Training or Education\nWithholding Degree\nRevocation of Degree\nTranscript Notation\nOther Actions\nB. Employee Remediations and Sanctions\nWarning \xe2\x80\x93 Written or Verbal\nPerformance Improvement Plan\nRequired Counseling\nRequired Training or Education\nDemotion\nSuspension without Pay\nSuspension with Pay\nTermination\nOther Actions\nC. Sanctioning for Sexual Misconduct\nUMB considers Sexual Assault to be the most serious sexual misconduct.\xc2\xa0 Respondents found responsible for Sexual Assault violations typically receive the most severe sanctions, including suspension or dismissal for students and termination for employees. However, UMB reserves the right to impose any level of sanction, ranging from a reprimand up to and including suspension or expulsion/termination, for any act of Sexual Misconduct, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\nThe Hearing Decision-maker or Panel reserves the right to deviate from the range of recommended sanctions in the case of serious mitigating circumstances or egregiously offensive conduct. Neither the initial hearing officers nor any appeals body or officer will deviate from the range of recommended sanctions unless compelling justification exists to do so.\nRespondents are expected to comply with all assigned sanctions, responsive actions, and corrective actions within the timeframe specified by the Decision-maker and/or Title IX Coordinator. Failure to abide by the sanctions/actions imposed by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanctions/actions, including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination, and may be noted on a student\xe2\x80\x99s official transcript or in an employee\xe2\x80\x99s official record. A suspension will be lifted only after compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator.\nD. Prohibition on Retaliation\nRetaliation is any adverse action taken because of a person\xe2\x80\x99s participation in a protected activity. Protected activities include reporting an incident that may implicate this Policy, participating in the resolution process (as a party or witness), supporting a reporting party, Complainant or Respondent, or assisting in providing information relevant to an investigation. Protected activities also include opposing Sexual Misconduct, refusing to participate in wrongful or unlawful activities or refusing to carry out a directive that would include engaging in or hiding wrongful or unlawful activities.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Adverse actions are negative professional or educational actions, that would not otherwise have been taken, to deter an individual from engaging in, or in retaliation against an individual for participating in, protected activities.\xc2\xa0 Adverse actions are actions that would dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in the complaint process (either as a party or non-party witness).\nActs of alleged retaliation should be reported immediately using the UMB Hotline and will be promptly investigated as a potential separate violation of this Policy. UMB is prepared to take appropriate steps to prevent retaliation.\nXII. RECORDS\nRecords of all allegations, investigations, formal and informal resolutions, and hearings will be kept for at least seven (7) years by the Title IX Coordinator. The Institution will also retain records of the training provided to Title IX Coordinators, investigators, and decision-makers.\nXIII. PREVENTION AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS\nAnnually, UMB community members are expected to participate in training that addresses Title IX rights, responsibilities, and obligations, raises awareness regarding Sexual Misconduct, and seeks to prevent its occurrence. Information on mandatory training will be provided through the Title IX website.\nTraining for Students: UMB provides mandatory student training at the beginning of each academic year.\nTraining for Employees: UMB provides mandatory employee training upon hire and at the beginning of each academic year. Additional mandatory training may be required based on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s role within UMB.\nAdditionally, University Recreation and Fitness (URecFit), in collaboration with University Police, offers Rape Aggression Defense Training (RAD) on techniques for prevention and defense.\nRequests for additional training can be made through the Office of Accountability and Compliance, at www.umaryland.edu/oac.\nXIV.
