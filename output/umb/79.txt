Statement Regarding Anti-Harassment Policies ▾
A message from Dr. Roger J. Ward, the University's Chief Accountability Officer
Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
Thank you for helping to make our campus a harassment-free environment.

Statement Regarding Anti-Harassment Policies ▾
A message from Dr. Roger J. Ward, the University's Chief Accountability Officer
Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Sexual discrimination (which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence) is a destructive practice that goes against the values of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and is not tolerated in any form. Sexual harassment violates basic human rights as well as state and federal laws. It is the policy of the University to try to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment within our community.
The University is committed to conducting a prompt and equitable investigation into all reports of sexual harassment. I encourage any student who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment to report all allegations to the Title IX Coordinator through the Office of Accountability and Compliance.
In addition, every student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator is required to become aware of and to support the University’s non-discrimination policies, and to work together to prevent sexual harassment.
Any student found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined; such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, suspension or expulsion.  Any University faculty or staff found to have engaged in sexual harassment will be promptly disciplined, and such discipline may include, if circumstances warrant, termination of employment.
Should you have a report of sexual harassment involving a student, any comments or questions about University policies  regarding students, or want more information about identifying and preventing sexual misconduct against students, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Students) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
As a UMB faculty or staff employee, if you have questions regarding the policies, prevention, and reporting process, please contact either the University’s Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator (Personnel) in the Office of Accountability and Compliance at 410-706-2281.
Thank you for helping to make our campus a harassment-free environment.

Title IX Reporting Analytics
In the spirit of UMB's core values, the Office of Accountability and Compliance embraces transparency and provides data on Title IX (Sexual Misconduct, Harassment, and Violence) reporting.
Definitions
Definitions of 'Type of Misconduct':
See VI-1.60(A) UMB Policy Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct and Sex and Gender-Based Discrimination
Definitions of 'Outcomes':
Substantiated - means supported by proof or evidence.
Informal Resolution - voluntary, structured interaction between or on behalf of involved parties to resolve or address concerns at the earliest stage possible. The informal resolution process is intended to be flexible while also providing for a full range of possible outcomes.
Unsubstantiated - not supported by proof or evidence.
Insufficient Information - report is lacking in quantity or quality of the information needed for conducting appropriate follow-up.
Referred - allegation did not fall under the definition of Sexual Misconduct but reflected unbecoming behavior, directed to appropriate entity or office for follow-up.
Title IX Supportive Services Only - alleged sexual misconduct that occurred at a location that is not controlled by UMB, the implicated party is outside UMB's control, or the impacted party declined to proceed with a formal complaint. UMB offers/provides supportive services to the impacted party.
Non-UMB issue - no parties involved are affiliated with UMB and the incident occurred at a location outside UMB's control. Incident was mis-reported to UMB.

Information will be kept as private to the fullest extent possible and will be disclosed only to those individuals who need to know in order to investigate and resolve the complaint, and/or as required by law.
For Sexual Misconduct/Prohibited Sex Discrimination: Responsible employees should complete the Hotline Form in full. The target of the alleged incident may request partial or complete confidentiality below. A request for confidentiality may limit the University’s ability to respond to the complaint. The University will take reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with that request, as long as doing so does not prevent the University from responding effectively to and preventing prohibited sex discrimination that may be directed toward others.
UMB's Hotline ‌is a single point of entry for reporting concerns in these areas.
When reporting sexual misconduct or harassment, choose the Sexual Misconduct category on the Hotline Report Page.

Aug. 14, 2020
To the UMB Community:On May 13, 2020, I communicated that the U.S. Department of Education had issued final amended regulations (the "Final Rule") regarding Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.In response to the Final Rule, the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) has released its Policy on Sexual Misconduct (VI-1.60(A)), which replaces the previous Policy Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct and Sex and Gender-Based Discrimination. This policy addresses the new requirements for defining and responding to reports of sexual misconduct. These changes are significant and, in some cases, require live hearings as part of the formal response.
In addition to the policy, UMB has issued two procedures that provide detailed expectations for the processes that will be used to respond to sexual misconduct:
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ("Title IX Procedures")
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ("Non-Title IX Procedures")
This policy and the procedures can be accessed from the UMB Policies and Procedures Library located here.
UMB's Office of Accountability and Compliance is operating remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, and our Title IX staff remains committed to providing information, resources, and assistance to our community. If you have questions, staff members are available via email at titleixcompliance@umaryland.edu or by telephone at 410-706-2281.
As always, if you have experienced, witnessed, or suspect someone has violated UMB's Policy on Sexual Misconduct, please do one of the following:
Report it via the UMB hotline.
Report it by calling 866-594-5220.
Contact Stephanie Suerth, UMB’s Acting Title IX Coordinator, 410-706-5212, ssuerth@umaryland.edu or Marc Ware, UMB’s Deputy Title IX Coordinator, 410-706-1852, mware@umaryland.edu .
The University has worked diligently to respond to the changes in the requirements while affirming our commitment to an environment that is free from sex and gender-based discrimination.
Sincerely,
Susan Buskirk, DM, MS
Chief Accountability Officer and Vice President

Policies and Procedures
UMB is committed to a working and learning environment that is free from sex and gender-based discrimination.
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex or gender, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, as well as retaliation for reporting Title IX-prohibited behaviors or participating in Title IX processes. Through our policies and procedures, UMB not only fulfills its regulatory requirements, it also communicates the expectations UMB has for our community, the actions required, or requested, of our community if they experience or observe sexual misconduct, and the actions our community can expect from UMB when it receives reports of sexual misconduct.
Title IX: Policies and Procedures
The current UMB policies and procedures regarding prohibited sex discrimination are:
UMB Notice of Non-Discrimination [VI-1.00(C)]
UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct  [VI-1.60(A)]
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Under the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 “Title IX Procedures”
UMB Procedures for Resolving Sexual Misconduct Complaints Outside the Jurisdiction of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 “Non-Title IX Procedures”
UMB Student Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures [VI-1.05(B)]
UMB Employee Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Policy and Procedures [VI-1.05(A)]
UMB Policy Concerning Consensual Relationships  [VII-2.10(B)]
Reporting Requirements
Under the UMB Policy on Sexual Misconduct, all UMB employees, including students employed by UMB, who learn of or observe conduct that they regard as a violation of the policy are required to report it to the Title IX Coordinator or Official with Authority. Reports made through UMB’s Hotline are considered to be made to the Title IX Coordinator. UMB encourages students to report any experienced, witnessed, or suspected violations of the policy.
Reports of Sexual Misconduct may be made to UMB using any of the following options:
1. Report by phone, email, or U.S. mail to the Title IX Coordinator:

The Clery Act Reporting
The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that sex offenses reportable under the Clery Act (20 U.S.C. §1092(f)) are reported in a timely manner to the UMB Police Department. An optional form for making the report can be found on the UMB Police website. Data collected for Clery Act reporting is to be used to increase public safety, not to identify the victim; therefore, personal identifying information is not required.
