Title IX protects people from  discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive  federal financial assistance. Title IX states:\nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education  program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\nScope of Title IX\nTitle IX applies to  schools, local and state educational agencies, and other institutions that  receive federal financial assistance from the Department. These recipients include  approximately 17,600 local school districts, over 5,000 postsecondary  institutions, and charter schools, for-profit schools, libraries, and museums.  Also included are vocational rehabilitation agencies and education agencies of  50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories of the United States.\nA recipient institution that receives Department funds must operate its education program or activity in a nondiscriminatory manner free of discrimination based on sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Some key issue areas in which recipients have Title IX obligations are: recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; treatment of LGBTQI+ students; discipline; single-sex education; and employment. Also, no recipient or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or its implementing regulations, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in a proceeding under Title IX. For a recipient to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. The Department\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX regulations (Volume 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 106) provide additional information about the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.\nOCR\xe2\x80\x99s Enforcement of  Title IX\nOCR vigorously  enforces Title IX to ensure that institutions that receive federal financial  assistance from the Department comply with the law. OCR evaluates,  investigates, and resolves\xc2\xa0complaints\xc2\xa0alleging sex discrimination. OCR also  conducts proactive investigations, through directed investigations or compliance  reviews, to examine potential systemic violations based on sources of  information other than complaints.\nIn addition to its  enforcement activities, OCR provides information and guidance\xc2\xa0to schools, universities and other educational  institutions and agencies to assist them in voluntarily complying with the law.\nTo learn more about  filing a complaint with OCR, please visit https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html.

Agency-initiated cases, typically called compliance reviews, permit OCR to target resources on compliance problems that appear particularly acute. OCR also provides technical assistance to help institutions achieve voluntary compliance with the civil rights laws that OCR enforces.  An important part of OCR's technical assistance are partnerships designed to develop creative approaches to preventing and addressing discrimination.\nThe Office for Civil Rights enforces several Federal civil rights laws that\nprohibit discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal financial\nassistance from the Department of Education. Discrimination on the basis of\nrace, color, and national origin is prohibited by Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; sex discrimination is prohibited by\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments\nof 1972; discrimination on the basis of disability is prohibited by Section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and age discrimination is prohibited\nby the Age Discrimination\nAct of 1975. These civil rights laws enforced by OCR extend to all state\neducation agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities,\nvocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies,\nlibraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. Areas\ncovered may include, but are not limited to: admissions, recruitment, financial\naid, academic programs, student treatment and services, counseling and guidance,\ndiscipline, classroom assignment, grading, vocational education, recreation,\nphysical education, athletics, housing, and employment. OCR also has responsibilities\nunder Title II of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by\npublic entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). To view OCR\xe2\x80\x99s guidance please visit the Policy Guidance Portal.\nIn addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy\nScouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001).\nUnder the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary school\nor State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more\noutside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities\nbefore or after school hours shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to\nmeet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy\nScouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United\nStates Code as a patriotic society.\nA complaint of discrimination can be filed by anyone who believes that an education institution that receives Federal financial assistance has discriminated against someone on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. The person or organization filing the complaint need not be a victim of the alleged discrimination, but may complain on behalf of another person or group.\nThe Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a mandatory biennial collection of district-and school-level data. The CRDC is administered by OCR, which uses the data to enforce civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national, origin, sex, and disability. The data are collected from public-school districts and public schools in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The CRDC collects data on civil rights indicators at the early childhood through grade 12 levels. It measures factors that impact education equity and opportunity for students, including student access to courses, programs, resources, instructional and other staff \xe2\x80\x93 and school climate factors, such as student discipline and harassment. The CRDC data can be accessed at https://ocrdata.ed.gov. To submit a CRDC data quality concern with OCR, please contact us by emailing ocrdata@ed.gov. Please include \xe2\x80\x9cCRDC Data Quality Concern\xe2\x80\x9d in the subject heading.\nMost of OCR's activities are conducted by its 12 enforcement offices\xc2\xa0throughout the country. These enforcement offices are organized into 4 divisions carrying out OCR's core work -- preventing, identifying, ending, and remedying discrimination against America's students. Three Enforcement Directors in the office of the Assistant Secretary oversee the work of, respectively, the Eastern and Southern and the Midwestern and Western divisions. OCR administrative offices in Washington, D.C., provide additional administrative support, coordination, policy development and overall leadership.\nTop\nPrintable view\nLast Modified: 05/24/2023\nHow Do I Find...\nStudent loans, forgiveness\nHigher Education Rulemaking\nCollege accreditation\nEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\nFERPA\nFAFSA\n1098, tax forms\nMore >\nInformation About...\nElevating Teaching\nEarly Learning\nEngage Every Student\nUnlocking Career Success\nCybersecurity\nHow to File a Complaint\nTopics A-Z\nCivil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)\nOther Civil Rights Agencies\nRecursos de la Oficina Para Derechos Civiles en Espa\xc3\xb1ol\nResources Available in Other Languages\nOur mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.\nStudent Loans\nRepaying Loans\nDefaulted Loans\nLoan Forgiveness\nLoan Servicers\nGrants & Programs\nApply for Pell Grants\nGrants Forecast\nApply for a Grant\nLaws & Guidance\nEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\nFERPA\nCivil Rights\nNew IDEA Website\nData & Research\nEducation Statistics\nPostsecondary Education Data\nED Data Express\nNation's Report Card\nWhat Works Clearinghouse\nOpen Data Platform\nCOVID Relief Data\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nED Offices\nJobs\nPress Releases\nFAQs\nRecursos en espa\xc3\xb1ol\nBudget, Performance\nPrivacy Program\nSubscribe to E-Mail Updates\nNotices FOIAPrivacy PolicyAccessibilitySecurityInformation qualityInspector GeneralWhitehouse.govUSA.govBenefits.govRegulations.gov\""];

The collection was formerly administered as the Elementary and Secondary School Survey.\nThe CRDC gathers a variety of information including student enrollment and student\xe2\x80\x99s access to educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, English learner, and disability. The CRDC is a longstanding and important aspect of the ED Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights laws for which it is responsible. Information collected by the CRDC is also used by other ED offices as well as policymakers and researchers outside of ED.\nFor further general information about the CRDC, visit the CRDC FAQ page.\n2021-22 and 2023-24 CRDCs NEW!\nOn April 18, 2023, OCR received approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to require all local educational agencies (LEA) in the country that receive federal financial assistance from ED, including every public school district, charter schools, juvenile justice facilities, alternative schools, and schools serving only students with disabilities, to respond to the CRDC for the 2021-22 and 2023-24 school years. OCR made changes to the CRDC, including, but not limited to the restoration of long-standing and useful data elements that have been collected in previous CRDCs as well as some new data elements.

These laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, sex, disability, and on the basis of age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries, and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds. OCR also has responsibilities under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (prohibiting disability discrimination by public entities, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance). In addition, as of January 8, 2002, OCR enforces the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (Section 9525 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Under the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, no public elementary or secondary school or State or local education agency that provides an opportunity for one or more outside youth or community groups to meet on school premises or in school facilities shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group listed in Title 36 of the United States Code as a patriotic society, that wishes to meet at the school.\nTop\nPrintable view\nLast Modified: 01/10/2020\nHow Do I Find...\nStudent loans, forgiveness\nHigher Education Rulemaking\nCollege accreditation\nEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\nFERPA\nFAFSA\n1098, tax forms\nMore >\nInformation About...\nElevating Teaching\nEarly Learning\nEngage Every Student\nUnlocking Career Success\nCybersecurity\nHow to File a Complaint\nTopics A-Z\nCivil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)\nOther Civil Rights Agencies\nRecursos de la Oficina Para Derechos Civiles en Espa\xc3\xb1ol\nResources Available in Other Languages\nOur mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.\nStudent Loans\nRepaying Loans\nDefaulted Loans\nLoan Forgiveness\nLoan Servicers\nGrants & Programs\nApply for Pell Grants\nGrants Forecast\nApply for a Grant\nLaws & Guidance\nEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\nFERPA\nCivil Rights\nNew IDEA Website\nData & Research\nEducation Statistics\nPostsecondary Education Data\nED Data Express\nNation's Report Card\nWhat Works Clearinghouse\nOpen Data Platform\nCOVID Relief Data\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nED Offices\nJobs\nPress Releases\nFAQs\nRecursos en espa\xc3\xb1ol\nBudget, Performance\nPrivacy Program\nSubscribe to E-Mail Updates\nNotices FOIAPrivacy PolicyAccessibilitySecurityInformation qualityInspector GeneralWhitehouse.govUSA.govBenefits.govRegulations.gov\""];

Cookies from ED.gov Web pages only collect information about your browser\'s visit to the site; they do not collect any personal information about you.\nThere are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.\nSession Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as \"Usage Tier 1-Single Session.\" The Guidance states, \"This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies.\"\nPersistent Cookies: We use persistent cookies for two reasons: 1) to enable Google\'s Universal Analytics to differentiate between new and returning visitors to our site, and 2) to block repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey.\nA Google\'s Universal Analytics (a third-party analytics provider) persistent cookie remains on your computer between visits to ED.gov for six months.  Knowing if a user visited ED.gov within the past six months tells us the difference between visitors and \"unique visitors\" or those who visit our website more than once during this time period).  This is an industry standard and provides high-level information on the breadth of traffic to and content usage of our given digital services.  It is a powerful, invaluable metric because it\'s the only measure that accurately calculates how many individual users visited ED.gov website in a given time. Combined with total visits, it tells a more comprehensive story about ED.gov users and their visit patterns.\nWe also use persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take either the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index) or iPerceptions survey. Based on your usage pattern, you may be asked if you would like to complete a customer survey of our website. The persistent cookie is set to block repeated survey invitations, and it expires in 90 days. Simply put, if you say you don\'t want to participate in the survey, the cookie will remember this, and will not allow you to be asked again. We feel it is important and respectful to our users not to ask them the same question more than once. The ACSI or iPerceptions survey are customer satisfaction survey tools used by multiple federal agencies and organizations in the private sector. We use these surveys so we can compare ED.gov results to other government agencies and top commercial websites. These surveys enables ED.gov to: measure program performance; identify targets of opportunity; efficiently leverage scarce resources; obtain valuable feedback from our users; focus management\'s attention on outcomes; and report customer satisfaction results.\nThe OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as \"Usage Tier 2-Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\" The Guidance states, \"This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected.\"\nIf you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can opt out or disable cookies in your browser. You will still have access to all information and resources at Department websites. However, turning off cookies may affect the functioning of some Department websites. Be aware that disabling cookies in your browser will affect cookie usage at all other websites you visit as well.\nED.gov uses a third-party analytics provider (Google\'s Universal Analytics) to analyze the data collected through the session and persistent metrics cookies.  The third-party analytics provider does not receive personally identifiable information through these cookies and does not combine, match, or cross-reference ED.gov information with any other information.  Please review the third-party analytics provider\'s privacy policy for additional information.\nPursuant OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance Attachment III, V, these cookies collect information similar to that automatically received and stored on the servers hosting ED.gov; they do not collect personally identifiable information.  ED.gov does not access or store the raw information collected through these cookies.  We do view aggregate statistical analyses prepared by our third-party analytics provider, but these analyses do not include any personally identifiable information.  We do not sell, rent, exchange, or otherwise disclose this information to persons or organizations.\xc2\xa0TOP\n4. Information from E-mail You Send to UsIf you decide to send us an electronic mail message (e-mail), the message will usually contain your return e-mail address.  If you include personally-identifying information in your e-mail because you want us to address issues specific to your situation, we may use that information in responding to your request. In other limited circumstances, including requests from Congress or limited other parties, we may be required by law to disclose information that you submit.\nAlso, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception.  Please send only information necessary to help us process your request.\xc2\xa0TOP\n5. Information Collected from Interactive FormsOn some of our web pages we offer interactive forms that let you voluntarily submit personal information (such as your e-mail address, name, or organization).  This occurs when you are registering for various conferences, workshops, or training sessions offered by ED, taking student aid counseling quizzes, ordering publications from ED Pubs, or submitting comments to various web discussion forums.  In those cases, all submitted information is used only for the expressed purposes for which it is intended and is not made available to any third party.  However, when you submit a comment to an ED web discussion forum, if you supply your name, e-mail address, or other personal information, that information is posted along with your comment.\xc2\xa0TOP\n6. Links to Other SitesOur policy discloses the privacy practices for the ED website.  But ED provides links to other websites. When you leave the ED website (www.ed.gov), you will be going to sites that are beyond our control.  We try to ensure that links that leave our site are clearly labeled, usually with a  icon. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. The privacy policies and procedures described here for ED do not apply to any external links. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any site you link to from ours, especially if you share any personal information.  Be informed.  You are the person best qualified to protect your own privacy.\xc2\xa0TOP\n7. Social MediaED is using third-party social media sites to provide ED content in formats that may be useful or interesting; however, ED.gov is the official source of information from the U.S. Department of Education (ED).  ED cannot attest to the accuracy of other information provided by these or any other linked sites.  Using these third-party sites does not constitute an endorsement by ED or any of its employees of the sponsors of the sites or the information or products presented on the sites.  Also, please be aware that the privacy protection provided at ED.gov may not be available on these third-party sites.
