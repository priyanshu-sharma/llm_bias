Discrimination
Sex and Sexual Harassment
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from treating any applicant, employee, or faculty member unfavorably with respect to the terms, conditions and privileges of employment because of such individual's sex.  Title VII also prohibits unwelcome conduct, based on sex, that is so severe and pervasive that it substantially interferes with a person's ability to perform their duties or that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities.  Under Title IX, sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, sexual violence and sexual coercion.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Jeanne Clery Act, expands the requirement of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment:  “Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Hostile Environment Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to,:
unwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;
unwelcome commentary about an individual's body or sexual activities;
threatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;
engaging in indecent exposure, voyeurism, or other invasions of personal privacy;
unwelcome physical touching or closeness;
unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature based upon sex stereotypes, including sex stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.
Sexual Violence: "Sexual Violence" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g. due to the person's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent).  Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion.
The University Sexual Harassment Policy, as well as the University Non-discrimination Policy, prohibit gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature. For further information regarding the University's process for reporting and investigating Sexual Harassment or Sexual Violence, click on the Title IX or Complaint Resolution Process tabs at the top.
If you believe you have been subjected to sex discrimination or sexual harassment or have witnessed sex discrimination or harassment, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, University Title IX Coordinator at civilrights@ku.edu, or file an online report.

Sexual Orientation
In the landmark decision, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 140 S.Ct. 1731 (2020), the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects gay and transgender workers from workplace discrimination.
Sexual orientation is the preferred term used to describe a pattern of emotional, romantic and sexual attraction to another person.
Homosexuality is defined as the romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. Transgender generally refers to an individual whose gender identity differs from the sex the person was identified as having at birth.
Sexual orientation discrimination involves adverse treatment of a person (an applicant, employee, or student) because of that person's sexual orientation (gay, lesbian, bisexual); because that person is perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual; or because that person is associated with persons who are gay, lesbian or bisexual.
If you believe you have been subjected to sexual orientation discrimination or have witnessed sexual orientation discrimination, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at civilrights@ku.edu or file a report online.

Sexual Violence
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual violence against anyone participating in education programs and activities.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Clery Act, expands the requirement of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) prohibits sexual violence against all people and provides guidelines on how universities should respond if victims of sexual violence disclose themselves to universities and colleges.
Sexual violence: "Sexual Violence" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g. due to the person's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent). Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion. Sexual violence can occur between strangers or acquaintances, including people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Sexual violence can be committed by men or by women, and it can occur between people of the same or different sex.
Sexual violence is a broad term and includes various forms of sexual misconduct, including but not limited to:
the deliberate touching of a person's intimate parts (including genitalia, groin, breast or buttocks, or clothing covering any of those areas);
using force to cause a person to touch their own or another person's intimate parts; penetration (anal, oral or vaginal) by a penis, tongue, finger, or an inanimate object;
taking sexual advantage of another person without consent, including causing or attempting to cause the incapacitation of another person;
causing the prostitution of another person;
allowing third parties to observe sexual acts;
engaging in voyeurism;
distributing intimate or sexual information about another person;
knowingly transmitting a sexually transmitted infection, including HIV, to another person; and/or
capturing or transmitting intimate or sexual utterances, sounds or images of another person.
Title IX and University Policy prohibit sex-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature.
The University Sexual Harassment Policy also prohibits sexual violence, including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual exploitation and stalking. If you have been subjected to sexual violence or have witnessed sexual violence, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at civilrights@ku.edu, or file a report online.
If you have been a victim of sexual violence follow these four steps:
Get to a safe place
Call someone you trust such as a friend or family member.
Seek medical attention to ensure your well-being as well as to have forensic evidence collected.
Give yourself time to heal, you are a survivor and what happened to you was not your fault
Here is a list of safe organizations for individuals who have encountered sexual violence. These organizations can help with medical attention, filing a report, and the healing process:
University of Kansas, Lawrence Campus & Douglas county

Emily Taylor Women's Resource Center

Definitions:
Sexual Harassment: “Sexual Harassment” is conduct on the basis of sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, or Stalking.
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment: “Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment” is an employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual contact.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment: “Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment may include, but is not limited to:
Unwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;
Unwelcome commentary about an individual’s body or sexual activities;
Threatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;
Engaging in indecent exposure; voyeurism, or other invasion of personal privacy;
Unwelcome physical touching or closeness that does not rise to the level of Sexual Assault; and
Unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon sex stereotypes, including stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
In cases of alleged Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment arising from speech (verbal, written, or electronic) or other forms of expressive activity, the University will interpret and apply the definition of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment in a manner that does not interfere with First Amendment free speech protections. Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.
The University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employee’s official duties.  Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employee’s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive.  In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.
Any other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.
Sexual Assault: “Sexual assault” includes:1
Penetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.  An “object” or “instrument” is anything used by the offender other than the offender’s genitalia.
Touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.
Domestic Violence: “Domestic Violence”  is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.
Dating Violence: “Dating Violence” is violence committed by a person –
Who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and
Where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
Stalking: “Stalking” is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.  For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:
(A) Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property.
(B) Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.
(C) Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.
1The University’s definition of “Sexual Assault” is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  Those regulations require the University to adopt a definition of “Sexual Assault” that incorporates various forcible and non-forcible sex crimes as defined by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting System.  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.30(a).

Addressing Sexual and Relationship Violence Toolkit
Addressing Sexual and Relationship Violence: A Trauma-Informed Approach
Updated September 8, 2020
This toolkit describes a public health model of trauma-informed care and provides guidance on engaging all campus constituents in creating a trauma-informed campus. The toolkit provides institutions of higher education with a comprehensive, meaningful resource to utilize when developing prevention programming as well as response to incidents of sexual violence experienced by members of the campus community.
Developed using best practices, current research, and resources from key organizations,
including The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network
(NCTSN), ACHA’s toolkit recommends a trauma-informed framework to better address the
impact sexual violence has on campus community members.
Campus sexual and relationship violence are serious public health issues adversely affecting college and university students because students cannot learn in an atmosphere in which they do not feel safe. In its 2016 Position Statement on Sexual and Relationship Violence on College and University Campuses and in its guidelines, ACHA affirms that campuses have a responsibility and an opportunity to engage with emerging research; evaluate the efficacy of their own prevention, response, and treatment efforts; and actively share lessons learned. Trauma-informed approaches should be adopted across campus in order to provide a more sensitive response and lower the risk of re-victimization. Services, resources, and training should be congruent with best practices as they evolve.
