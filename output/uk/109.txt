Title IX and Sexual Violence
Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 states that "no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."  The KU Medical Center prohibits all forms of sex-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual violence and assault, and is committed to preventing sex discrimination that impacts any person's opportunity to participate in or benefit from the University's programs and activities.
All KUMC employees are expected to report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual assault of which they become aware.  Please review the KU Medical Center's Title IX Resolution Process for more information regarding the procedures for preventing, reporting and investigating Title IX violations.
If you or someone you know has been subjected to sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assault, please submit a report using this online form or contact University Title IX Coordinator: Lauren Jones McKown at civilrights@ku.edu.

Sex and Sexual Harassment
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from treating any applicant, employee, or faculty member unfavorably with respect to the terms, conditions and privileges of employment because of such individual's sex.  Title VII also prohibits unwelcome conduct, based on sex, that is so severe and pervasive that it substantially interferes with a person's ability to perform their duties or that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities.  Under Title IX, sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, sexual violence and sexual coercion.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Jeanne Clery Act, expands the requirement of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.
Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment:  “Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment” is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University’s education programs and activities.
Hostile Environment Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to,:
unwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;
unwelcome commentary about an individual's body or sexual activities;
threatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;
engaging in indecent exposure, voyeurism, or other invasions of personal privacy;
unwelcome physical touching or closeness;
unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature based upon sex stereotypes, including sex stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.
Sexual Violence: "Sexual Violence" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g. due to the person's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent).  Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion.
The University Sexual Harassment Policy, as well as the University Non-discrimination Policy, prohibit gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature. For further information regarding the University's process for reporting and investigating Sexual Harassment or Sexual Violence, click on the Title IX or Complaint Resolution Process tabs at the top.
If you believe you have been subjected to sex discrimination or sexual harassment or have witnessed sex discrimination or harassment, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX, University Title IX Coordinator at civilrights@ku.edu, or file an online report.

Sexual Orientation
In the landmark decision, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 140 S.Ct. 1731 (2020), the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects gay and transgender workers from workplace discrimination.
Sexual orientation is the preferred term used to describe a pattern of emotional, romantic and sexual attraction to another person.
Homosexuality is defined as the romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. Transgender generally refers to an individual whose gender identity differs from the sex the person was identified as having at birth.
Sexual orientation discrimination involves adverse treatment of a person (an applicant, employee, or student) because of that person's sexual orientation (gay, lesbian, bisexual); because that person is perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual; or because that person is associated with persons who are gay, lesbian or bisexual.
If you believe you have been subjected to sexual orientation discrimination or have witnessed sexual orientation discrimination, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at civilrights@ku.edu or file a report online.

Sexual Violence
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual violence against anyone participating in education programs and activities.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Clery Act, expands the requirement of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) prohibits sexual violence against all people and provides guidelines on how universities should respond if victims of sexual violence disclose themselves to universities and colleges.
Sexual violence: "Sexual Violence" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g. due to the person's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent). Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion. Sexual violence can occur between strangers or acquaintances, including people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Sexual violence can be committed by men or by women, and it can occur between people of the same or different sex.
Sexual violence is a broad term and includes various forms of sexual misconduct, including but not limited to:
the deliberate touching of a person's intimate parts (including genitalia, groin, breast or buttocks, or clothing covering any of those areas);
using force to cause a person to touch their own or another person's intimate parts; penetration (anal, oral or vaginal) by a penis, tongue, finger, or an inanimate object;
taking sexual advantage of another person without consent, including causing or attempting to cause the incapacitation of another person;
causing the prostitution of another person;
allowing third parties to observe sexual acts;
engaging in voyeurism;
distributing intimate or sexual information about another person;
knowingly transmitting a sexually transmitted infection, including HIV, to another person; and/or
capturing or transmitting intimate or sexual utterances, sounds or images of another person.
Title IX and University Policy prohibit sex-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature.
The University Sexual Harassment Policy also prohibits sexual violence, including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual exploitation and stalking. If you have been subjected to sexual violence or have witnessed sexual violence, please contact the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at civilrights@ku.edu, or file a report online.
If you have been a victim of sexual violence follow these four steps:
Get to a safe place
Call someone you trust such as a friend or family member.
Seek medical attention to ensure your well-being as well as to have forensic evidence collected.
Give yourself time to heal, you are a survivor and what happened to you was not your fault
Here is a list of safe organizations for individuals who have encountered sexual violence. These organizations can help with medical attention, filing a report, and the healing process:
