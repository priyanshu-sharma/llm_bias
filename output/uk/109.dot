Title VII also prohibits unwelcome conduct, based on sex, that is so severe and pervasive that it substantially interferes with a person\'s ability to perform their duties or that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment.\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\xc2\xa0prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities.\xc2\xa0 Under Title IX, sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, sexual violence and sexual coercion.\nThe Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Jeanne Clery

Harassment:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cHostile Environment Sexual Harassment\xe2\x80\x9d is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person

harassment may include, but is not limited to,:\nunwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;\nunwelcome commentary about an individual\'s body or sexual activities;\nthreatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;\nengaging in indecent exposure, voyeurism, or other invasions of personal privacy;\nunwelcome physical touching or closeness;\nunwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature based upon sex stereotypes, including sex stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.\nSexual Violence:\xc2\xa0\"Sexual Violence\" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person\'s will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g.\xc2\xa0due to the person\'s age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent).\xc2\xa0 Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion.\nThe University Sexual Harassment Policy, as well as the University\xc2\xa0Non-discrimination Policy, prohibit
