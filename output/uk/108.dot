from\xc2\xa0treating\xc2\xa0any applicant, employee, or\xc2\xa0faculty member unfavorably with respect to the terms, conditions and privileges of employment because of such individual\'s sex.\xc2\xa0 Title VII also prohibits unwelcome conduct, based on sex, that is so severe and pervasive that it substantially interferes with a person\'s ability to perform their duties or that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment.\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\xc2\xa0prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities.\xc2\xa0 Under Title IX, sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, sexual violence and sexual coercion.\nThe Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act of 2013, which amended the Jeanne Clery Act,\xc2\xa0expands\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0requirement\xc2\xa0of reporting sexual violence to include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.\nHostile Environment Sexual Harassment:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cHostile Environment Sexual Harassment\xe2\x80\x9d is unwelcome conduct (including physical, visual, audible, and electronic conduct) determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the University\xe2\x80\x99s education programs and activities.\nHostile Environment Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to,:\nunwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;\nunwelcome commentary about an individual\'s body or sexual activities;\nthreatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;\nengaging in indecent exposure, voyeurism, or other invasions of personal privacy;\nunwelcome physical touching or closeness;\nunwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature based upon sex stereotypes, including sex stereotypes based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.\nSexual Violence:\xc2\xa0\"Sexual Violence\" refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person\'s will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g.\xc2\xa0due to the person\'s age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the individual from having the capacity to consent).\xc2\xa0 Sexual violence includes rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and sexual coercion.\nThe University Sexual Harassment Policy, as well as the University\xc2\xa0Non-discrimination Policy, prohibit gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of

Student speech or expressive activity that is offensive but not severe or pervasive is generally not a sufficient basis to support a finding of Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment.\nThe University has a legitimate interest in holding employees (including administrators, faculty, and staff) to a higher standard than others with respect to unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s official duties.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, except as stated below, unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex by an employee that occurs in the workplace or otherwise pursuant to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s official duties is prohibited, and may result in disciplinary action, if the conduct is objectively offensive, even if it is not severe or pervasive.\xc2\xa0 In determining the severity of any disciplinary action taken for a violation of this paragraph by a University employee, the University will consider the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct at issue, the impact the conduct had on individuals subject to the conduct, any prior discipline for similar conduct, and any other relevant factors.\nAny other provisions of this policy notwithstanding, speech and other forms of expressive activity occurring in an academic or research context will not violate this policy unless the speech or expressive activity lacks a legitimate academic, educational, or research purpose.\nSexual Assault: \xe2\x80\x9cSexual assault\xe2\x80\x9d includes:1\nPenetration or attempted penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus by the sexual organ of the other person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.\nOral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.\nUse of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.\xc2\xa0 An \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinstrument\xe2\x80\x9d is anything used by the offender other than the offender\xe2\x80\x99s genitalia.\nTouching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.\nSexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.\nSexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurs.\nDomestic Violence: \xe2\x80\x9cDomestic Violence\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 is felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person\xe2\x80\x99s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Kansas.\nDating Violence: \xe2\x80\x9cDating Violence\xe2\x80\x9d is violence committed by a person \xe2\x80\x93\nWho is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and\nWhere the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of the relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\nStalking: \xe2\x80\x9cStalking\xe2\x80\x9d is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for their safety or the safety of others, or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress.\xc2\xa0 For the purpose of this definition, the following terms have the described meaning:\n(A) Course of Conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties by any action, method, device, or means, follows monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person\xe2\x80\x99s property.\n(B) Reasonable Person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.\n(C) Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.\n1The University\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cSexual Assault\xe2\x80\x9d is mandated by federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.\xc2\xa0 Those regulations require the University to adopt a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cSexual Assault\xe2\x80\x9d that incorporates various forcible and non-forcible sex crimes as defined by the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s Uniform Crime Reporting System.\xc2\xa0 See 34 C.F.R. \xc2\xa7 106.30(a).\nKeywords:\xc2\xa0Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence, Harassment, Hostile Environment, Discrimination\nChange History:\xc2\xa005/16/2022: Updated to align with KBOR\'s Statement on Free Expression.\n09/01/2021: Updated IOA to the Office of Civil Rights & Title IX.\n07/15/2021: Updated links.\n07/13/2021: Updated KUMC contact information.\n08/14/2020: Updated definitions and aligned with federal Title IX regulations;

Violence Toolkit\nAddressing Sexual and Relationship Violence: A Trauma-Informed Approach\nUpdated September 8, 2020\nThis toolkit describes a public health model of trauma-informed care and provides guidance on engaging all campus constituents in creating a trauma-informed campus.\xc2\xa0The toolkit provides institutions of higher education with a comprehensive, meaningful resource to utilize when developing prevention programming as well as response to incidents of sexual violence experienced by members of the campus community.\nDeveloped using best practices, current research, and resources from key organizations,\nincluding The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health\nServices Administration (SAMHSA), and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network\n(NCTSN), ACHA\xe2\x80\x99s toolkit recommends a trauma-informed framework to better address the\nimpact sexual violence has on campus community members.\nCampus sexual and relationship violence are serious public health issues adversely affecting college and university students because students cannot learn in an atmosphere in which they do not feel safe. In its 2016 Position Statement on Sexual and Relationship Violence on College and University Campuses and in its guidelines, ACHA affirms that campuses have a responsibility and an opportunity to engage with emerging research; evaluate the efficacy of their own prevention, response, and treatment efforts; and actively share lessons learned. Trauma-informed approaches should be adopted across campus in order to provide a more sensitive response and lower the risk of re-victimization.
