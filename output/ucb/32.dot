The majority of primary, secondary and higher\xc2\xa0education institutions in the United States receive federal financial assistance.\nSince 1972, Title IX has become an important civil rights law. One lasting impact\xc2\xa0of Title IX is that the law afforded women access to the same athletic\xc2\xa0opportunities as men in educational settings. Title IX greatly\xc2\xa0expanded women\xe2\x80\x99s participation in sports.\nIn 1977,\xc2\xa0Catherine MacKinnon created a framework\xc2\xa0defining sexual harassment as a form of discrimination based on sex. Soon after, MacKinnon\xe2\x80\x99s framework was used in\xc2\xa0Alexander v. Yale, putting forth the legal argument that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination prohibited under Title IX. While the case was dismissed, it resulted in educational institutions establishing grievance procedures for sexual harassment.\xc2\xa0Generations of student activists have subsequently advocated for programs to\xc2\xa0prevent and address sexual violence and harassment in educational institutions across the U.S.\nIn 2015, Gavin Grimm, a transgender student, sued his school board, alleging\xc2\xa0its policy of prohibiting him from using the boys\' bathroom violated Title IX and the equal protection clause of the Constitution.\xc2\xa0A federal judge in Virginia ruled in his favor in 2018.\xc2\xa0The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the ruling in his favor in August 2020.\nIn addition to sexual harassment, the scope of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX includes discrimination based on:\nsex stereotypes\nsex characteristics\npregnancy or related conditions\nsexual orientation\ngender identity (including the protection of transgender and non-binary people from discrimination)\nRecent developments in Title IX\nTitle IX regulations were most recently amended in 2020, under the previous administration. UC opposed many of the regulations issued at that time.\nIn 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14021 \xe2\x80\x93 Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free From Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity, prompting a comprehensive review of the 2020 amendments.\nOn June 23, 2022, the federal Department of Education (DOE) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Title IX. DOE released proposed changes to the regulations for public comment. As the UC Office of the President said in a statement, \xe2\x80\x9cthe proposed rules represent a great improvement over the regulations issued by the previous administration in 2020.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUntil the Title IX regulations are amended, the 2020 regulations are still in place.

Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.\" (Marin Health & Human Services)\nDue to societal inequalities and other factors, different individuals need different resources or opportunities to be able to access educational programs.\nIntersectionality\n\"The concept of intersectionality, coined by Professor\xc2\xa0Kimberl\xc3\xa9 Crenshaw, describes the ways in which systems of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, class and other forms of discrimination \'intersect\' to create unique dynamics and effects.\" (Center for Intersectional Justice)\nEach person holds multiple identities at the same time, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, class, language, and culture.\nInequalities are all interconnected. An individual can also experience multiple forms of discrimination or harassment at the same time.\nImage credits: Equality vs Equity: Angus Maguire; Intersectionality: Other Sociologist\nAddress\nOPHD2111 Bancroft Way, Suite 300Berkeley, CA 94720-1120Email: ask_ophd@berkeley.eduPhone: (510) 643-7985Fax: (510) 643-3578\nOffice of the Chancellor\nOffice of the ChancellorAudit and Advisory Services(link is external)Communications & Public AffairsOffice of Ethics, Risk & Compliance ServicesGovernment & Community RelationsOffice of Legal AffairsStaff Ombuds\nEthics, Risk, & Compliance\nEthics(link is external)Compliance(link is external)Office for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination(link is external)Disability Compliance(link is external)Risk Services(link is external)Privacy(link is external)\nWhistleblower\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nBerkeley Home Page(link is external)Campus Administration(link is external)Berkeley News(link is external)The Campaign for Berkeley(link is external)Visiting Berkeley\nHome\nCredits\nPowered by Open Berkeley\nAccessibility Statement\nNondiscrimination Policy Statement\nPrivacy Statement\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2023 UC Regents; all rights reserved\nBack to Top'"];

By making Juneteenth a federal holiday, all Americans can feel the power of this day and learn from our history \xe2\x80\x93 and celebrate progress and grapple with the distance we\xe2\x80\x99ve come (and) the distance we have to travel,\xe2\x80\x9d Biden said.\nThe ceremony, which took place in the East Room, included some 80 members of Congress \xe2\x80\x93 including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, local elected officials, community leaders and activists. The President specifically noted that Opal Lee, the activist who campaigned to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday, was in attendance.\nJuneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Only a handful of states currently observe Juneteenth as a paid holiday.\nBiden, speaking at the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, repeated the sentiments he relayed when he commemorated the Tulsa race massacre earlier this year, that \xe2\x80\x9cgreat nations don\xe2\x80\x99t ignore their most painful moments.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMINNEAPOLIS, MN - JUNE 19: A man carries a Black Liberation flag through a Juneteenth celebration at the memorial for George Floyd outside Cup Foods on June 19, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Great nations don\xe2\x80\x99t walk away. We\xe2\x80\x99ve come to terms with the mistakes we made and in remembering those moments, we begin to heal and grow stronger,\xe2\x80\x9d the President said.\nDuring the ceremony, the President said it was not enough to commemorate the holiday, but to use it as a day of reflection and action.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t rest until the promise of equality if fulfilled for every one of us in every corner of this nation. That to me is the meaning of Juneteenth,\xe2\x80\x9d Biden said.\nBiden also underscored how his White House agenda is working to deliver equality and emphasized that the promise of equality is not going to fulfilled \xe2\x80\x9cso long as the sacred right to vote remains under attack.\xe2\x80\x9d The President specifically pointed to restrictive voter laws in some states, calling them \xe2\x80\x9can assault that offends our very democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe holiday is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the eleventh federal holiday recognized by the US federal government. The US Office of Personnel Management announced Thursday that most federal employees will observe the holiday on Friday since Juneteenth falls on a Saturday this year.\nThe legislation, which was passed by Congress on Wednesday, gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd last year. It was also spurred after Democrats won the White House and control of the House of Representatives and the US Senate.\nThe bill passed the House on Wednesday with a 415-14 vote after\xc2\xa0the Senate unanimously passed the legislation\xc2\xa0the day before.\nThe bill had bipartisan sponsors that included Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts.\nIn this August 2018 photo, Black Voters Matter Fund co-founders, LaTosha Brown, left, and Cliff Albright, right, lead Mississippi grassroots partners in some empowerment cheers aboard a bus tour to Greenville, Mississippi.\nRogelio V. Solis/AP\n'Eyes on the prize': Two activists set aside personal threats to fight new voting restrictions\nAt the White House on Thursday, Biden lauded members of Congress for the bipartisan effort, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope this is the beginning of a change in the way we deal with one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLee told reporters ahead of the final passage of the bill, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I see here today is racial divide crumbling, being crushed this day under a momentous vote that brings together people who understand the value of freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe 14 Republicans who voted against the bill were Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin, Doug LaMalfa of California, Tom McClintock of California, Mike Rogers of Alabama, Matt Rosendale of Montana, Ronny Jackson of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Chip Roy of Texas and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\nWisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson had previously blocked the bill in 2020, saying that the day off for federal employees would cost US taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. But Johnson dropped his objection this week despite his concerns, which paved the way for the bill\xe2\x80\x99s passage in the Senate.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.\nCNN\xe2\x80\x99s Daniella Diaz, Annie Grayer and Alex Rogers contributed to this report.\nRelated\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nSearch\nLog In\nMy Account\nSettings\nTopics You Follow\nLog Out\nYour CNN account\nLog in to your CNN account\nLive TV\nAudio\nUS\nCrime + Justice\nEnergy + Environment\nExtreme Weather\nSpace + Science\nWorld\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nChina\nEurope\nIndia\nMiddle East\nUnited Kingdom\nPolitics\nSCOTUS\nCongress\nFacts First\n2024 Elections\nBusiness\nTech\nMedia\nCalculators\nVideos\nMarkets\nPre-markets\nAfter-Hours\nMarket Movers\nFear & Greed\nWorld Markets\nInvesting\nMarkets Now\nBefore the Bell\nNightcap\nOpinion\nPolitical Op-Eds\nSocial Commentary\nHealth\nLife, But Better\nFitness\nFood\nSleep\nMindfulness\nRelationships\nEntertainment\nMovies\nTelevision\nCelebrity\nTech\nInnovate\nGadget\nForeseeable Future\nMission: Ahead\nUpstarts\nWork Transformed\nInnovative Cities\nStyle\nArts\nDesign\nFashion\nArchitecture\nLuxury\nBeauty\nVideo\nTravel\nDestinations\nFood & Drink\nStay\nNews\nVideos\nSports\nPro Football\nCollege Football\nBasketball\nBaseball\nSoccer\nOlympics\nHockey\nVideos\nLive TV\nCNN Headlines\nCNN Max\nDigital Studios\nCNN Films\nHLN\nTV Schedule\nTV Shows A-Z\nCNNVR\nAudio\nCNN Underscored\nElectronics\nFashion\nBeauty\nHealth & Fitness\nHome\nReviews\nDeals\nMoney\nGifts\nTravel\nOutdoors\nPets\nCNN Store\nCoupons\nWeather\nClimate\nStorm Tracker\nWildfire Tracker\nVideo\nAbout CNN\nPhotos\nInvestigations\nCNN Profiles\nCNN Leadership\nCNN Newsletters\nWork for CNN\nAudio\nLive TV\nFollow CNN Politics\nLog In\nMy Account\nSettings\nTopics You Follow\nLog Out\nYour CNN account\nLog in to your CNN account\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nAccessibility & CC\nAbout\nNewsletters\nTranscripts\n\xc2\xa9 2023 Cable News Network.
