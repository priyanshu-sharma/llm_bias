Discretion in Application\n.060\xc2\xa0Questions\n.010 Policy Prohibiting Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and Procedure for Reviewing Complaints\nA. Prohibited Conduct\nKansas State University is committed to maintaining academic, housing, and work environments that are free of discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment. Discrimination based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, ancestry, disability, genetic information, military status, or veteran status is prohibited. Retaliation against a person for reporting or objecting to discrimination or harassment or for participating in an investigation or other proceeding is a violation of this Policy, whether or not discrimination or harassment occurred. This Policy is not intended for, and will not be used to, infringe on academic freedom or to censor or punish students, faculty, employees, or staff who exercise their legitimate First Amendment rights.\nThis Policy sets forth how the Kansas State University will proceed once it is made aware of possible prohibited conduct in keeping with the University\xe2\x80\x99s institutional values. This Policy also complies with the University\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX)(As amended May 6, 2020 and implemented August 14, 2020) which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the University\xe2\x80\x99s programs or activities; relevant sections of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in employment; and other applicable law.\nB. Jurisdiction\nThis Policy covers discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, and retaliation occurring on campus, or otherwise within the context of University education programs and activities, whether those are on campus or off campus. It applies to persons who are on campus or who otherwise participate in or attempt to participate in the University education programs and activities (as further defined herein) , such as employees, students, applicants for employment or admission, contractors, vendors, visitors, and guests. Conduct that occurs off campus and outside the context of the University\xe2\x80\x99s education programs and activities is covered by this Policy only to the extent such conduct has a nexus to discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, or retaliation that is alleged to have occurred on-campus or in the context of the University\xe2\x80\x99s education programs and activities.\nIn Title IX Sexual Harassment cases (as described in this Policy), complainants must be participating in or attempting to participate in the University\xe2\x80\x99s education programs and activities at the time the formal, written complaint is submitted.\nFor purposes of this policy, the University\xe2\x80\x99s education programs and activities are defined as the operations of the University, including, but not limited to, in-person and online educational instruction, employment, research activities, extracurricular activities, athletics, residence life, dining services, performances, and community engagement and outreach programs. The term applies to all activity that occurs on campus or on other property owned or occupied by the University.\xc2\xa0 It also includes off-campus locations, events, or circumstances over which the University exercises substantial control over the alleged perpetrator and the context in which the misconduct occurs.\nAll reports of conduct prohibited by this Policy should be submitted as soon as practicable to the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE). A delay in submitting a report could decrease the availability of supporting evidence, and the reason for a delay may be reviewed during the investigation and decision-making phases of the process.\nC. Responsibilities of Persons Subject to the Policy \xe2\x80\x93 Reporting and Cooperation\nSupervisors (within their area of supervision) and administrators must make reports of possible violations of this Policy to OIE as soon as practicable upon notification (including by email if after regular business hours), must keep reports confidential, and must protect the privacy of all parties involved in a report. Failure to do so is a violation of this Policy. Employees who have information relevant to a report that they are not a party to may be required to provide that information in connection with the processes under this Policy.\nAll parties to matters covered by this Policy are encouraged to cooperate fully in administrative reviews, investigations, and, in Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, grievance hearings, and to provide information, including official personnel or student files and records, and other materials that OIE and/or the ART deems necessary to complete a thorough review of complaints. If an individual declines to cooperate, the University will proceed under this Policy based on the information available to it and, when appropriate, may issue sanctions under the Policy.\nParties are prohibited from any conduct that interferes with or could be seen as interfering with the processes under this Policy. This includes, but is not limited to, coercing or bribing witnesses or tampering with evidence.\nAny person who knowingly files a false report or complaint, who knowingly provides false or misleading information, or who violates the confidentiality provisions of this Policy, is subject to disciplinary action. No action will be taken against an individual who makes a good faith report or complaint, even if the allegations are not substantiated.\nVendors on-campus or for University programs or activities must comply with this Policy. Depending on the circumstances, vendors \xe2\x80\x93 with the approval of OIE \xe2\x80\x93 may conduct investigations of their own employees and/or participate in determinations regarding alleged violations of this Policy. Prior to, during, and after such an investigation, the vendor will provide information as requested by OIE. OIE may require a vendor to include an OIE staff member as part of an investigation if OIE believes participation is necessary to ensure that the University\'s interests under this Policy are appropriately addressed.\nD. Confidentiality\nThe University endeavors to keep reports and other information obtained through this Chapter 3010 process confidential to the extent possible. To protect the privacy of the parties and the integrity of the process, parties, witnesses, and any others involved are encouraged to limit their discussion of the matter except as necessary for a party to gather or present evidence relevant to the matter or otherwise seek resources. Employees who are witnesses to misconduct shall not disclose information about the matter or their involvement in the case to anyone who does not have a need to know in connection with the Policy process.\nA party or witness may be questioned about any conversations they have about the matter, and those conversations may be considered as evidence in the case, except to the extent they are protected under a legally recognized privilege.\nReports and other information may be disclosed to state or federal anti-discrimination agencies for investigations or audits, and during litigation.\nE. Potential Sanctions, Remedial Actions, and Changes to Situations\nPersons who violate this Policy are subject to sanctions. Sanctions are determined on a case-by-case basis. They may include, among other appropriate sanctions, \"no contact\" orders, warnings, probation, educational and/or training requirements, notations on transcripts, exclusion from the campus, dismissal from employment, suspension or expulsion from the University, and any combination of the same.\nRemedial actions may be taken to address the effects of a violation of this Policy. Examples of remedial actions include, but are not limited to, reevaluation of a grade, an evaluation completed by someone other than the respondent, reconsideration of an application for employment, placement in a position, back pay and lost benefits, withdrawal of a disciplinary action, alteration of class schedule, or a change of housing.\nWith respect to alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, the University offers to complainants and respondents reasonable and available changes (i.e. supportive measures) to academic, living, transportation, and working situations if requested, regardless of whether formal, written complaint is made to the university, a criminal complaint is made to police or whether the report otherwise falls outside this Policy\'s jurisdiction. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the implementation of supportive measures in cases of Title IX Sexual Harassment. In other cases, parties should communicate with the Office of Institutional Equity, their supervisors, or the Office of Student Life regarding available resources. Certain changes may not be available unless a violation of this Policy is found.\nF. Training and Education\nThe University will provide training and educational programming to promote the awareness of rape, acquaintance rape, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking to incoming students and new employees, as well as ongoing campus-wide prevention and awareness campaigns regarding sexual violence and other anti-discrimination topics.\nG. Exclusivity\nThis Policy provides the University\'s exclusive means of review of allegations of discrimination, harassment (including sexual harassment and sexual violence), domestic and dating violence, retaliation, and stalking. The Policy shall supersede any other University policies or procedures that conflict with it; however, nothing herein prevents the University from taking appropriate risk management measures based on a person\'s conduct including, but not limited to, measures under PPM 3015.\n.020 Definitions\nA.\xc2\xa0 Discrimination\nIn this Policy, discrimination is treating an individual adversely in employment, housing, or academic decisions based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, ancestry, disability, genetic information, military status, or veteran status without a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the treatment, or maintaining seemingly neutral policies, practices, or requirements that have a disparate impact on employment, on-campus housing, or academic opportunities of members of the above-listed protected categories without a valid business or academic reason.\nB.\xc2\xa0 Harassment\nIn cases of alleged conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, ancestry, disability, genetic information, military status, or veteran status, \xe2\x80\x9charassment\xe2\x80\x9d is:\nIn the work, housing, or other non-academic University environment, conduct toward a person or persons that has the purpose or effect of, OR in the University academic environment, conduct toward a person or persons that has the purpose and effect of:\nCreating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the person(s); orUnreasonably interfering with the work, on-campus housing, or other academic or non-academic University environment of the person(s), as applicable; ANDThat conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it alters the terms, conditions, or privileges of a person\xe2\x80\x99s employment, use of on-campus housing, academic opportunities or participation in university-sponsored activities.\nWhether conduct is sufficient to constitute \xe2\x80\x9charassment\xe2\x80\x9d is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or merely an offensive utterance. These factors are evaluated from both subjective and objective viewpoints, considering not only effect that conduct actually had on the person, but also the impact it would likely have had on a reasonable person in the same situation.\xc2\xa0The conduct must subjectively and objectively meet the definition to be \xe2\x80\x9charassment\xe2\x80\x9d to be a violation of this Policy.\xc2\xa0 Repeated incidents, even where each would not, on its own, constitute harassment, may collectively constitute harassment. Conduct meeting this definition of harassment is discrimination.\nC.\xc2\xa0 Sexual Harassment\nIn this policy, the term \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d has two definitions. The first definition reflects requirements from August 2020 Title IX regulations and will follow the investigation grievance process described further below; the other definition reflects requirements from other anti-discrimination laws (such as Title VII) and will follow the investigation and administrative review process described further below.\nConduct meeting either definition of \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d is discrimination and is prohibited by this policy. Depending on the circumstances, some alleged conduct may be evaluated under both definitions of \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d Conduct that does not meet either definition of \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d may also be additionally evaluated under the definition of \xe2\x80\x9charassment\xe2\x80\x9d above if it involves conduct on a basis of another protected status.\nTitle IX Regulation (implemented August 14, 2020) Definition of \xe2\x80\x9cSexual Harassment\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn cases of alleged conduct based on sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, for purposes of the Title IX process, \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d is any conduct that occurs in the United States and that satisfies one or more of the following:\nA University employee conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the University\xe2\x80\x99s educational program or activity; or\xe2\x80\x9cSexual assault\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v), \xe2\x80\x9cdating violence\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(10), \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(8), or \xe2\x80\x9cstalking\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(30).\nThis definition is referred to throughout the Policy as \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX Sexual Harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d All allegations of conduct based on sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, are first evaluated and processed under this definition. There is a presumption that a respondent is not responsible for alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment unless and until a determination regarding responsibility is final.\nIf the alleged conduct does not meet this definition, it also will be evaluated and processed under the definition immediately below.\nGeneral Anti-Discrimination Definition of \xe2\x80\x9cSexual Harassment\xe2\x80\x9d for Alleged Conduct Not Meeting the Definition Immediately Above\nFor purposes of alleged conduct not meeting the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment, \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d is a type of harassment based on sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity that involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, disparagement of members of one sex, or other conduct of a sexual nature when:\nSubmission to or rejection of such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s employment, Education, on-campus housing, or participation in a university-sponsored activity or program; orSubmission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for or as a factor in decisions affecting that individual\xe2\x80\x99s employment, Education, on-campus housing, or participation in a university-sponsored activity or program; orSuch conduct meets either \xe2\x80\x9charassment\xe2\x80\x9d definition in B., above; andThe conduct is sufficiently severe, or pervasive that it effectively alters the terms, conditions, or privileges of the person\xe2\x80\x99s employment, use of on-campus housing, academic opportunities, or participation in university-sponsored activities or programs.\nFor purposes of this definition, the conduct may occur in any University program or activity, regardless of whether that program or activity occurs inside or outside the United States. Conduct that would rise to the level of Title IX Sexual Harassment but for the fact that it occurred outside the United States will be evaluated under this definition.\nBoth types of \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d may occur between any persons regardless of gender, and either as single or repeated incidents. Whether conduct is sufficient to constitute \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or merely an offensive utterance.\xc2\xa0 These factors are evaluated from both subjective and objective viewpoints, considering not only the effect that the conduct actually had on the person, but also the impact it would likely have had on a reasonable person in the same situation.\xc2\xa0 The conduct must subjectively and objectively meet these definitions to be \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment\xe2\x80\x9d under this Policy.\nD. Consent\nPermission or an agreement for something to happen. To be consent, the person must have the capacity to consent and the permission or agreement must be knowing and given without coercion. Consent will not necessarily be inferred from silence or passivity alone. Whether someone has given consent is based on the totality of the circumstances, including the context. Once consent to a sexual act has been given, consent can be withdrawn if communicated to the other person before or during that sexual act.\nA person has capacity to consent to a sexual act if the person:\ncan understand the sexual nature of the proposed act, andcan understand that he or she has the right to refuse to participate in the act, andpossesses a rudimentary grasp of the possible results arising from participation in the act.\nA person may be incapable of giving consent because of mental deficiency or disease, or because of the effect of any alcohol, narcotic, drug or other substance that renders the person incapacitated, when that condition is known by the offender or is reasonably apparent to the offender.\nE.\xc2\xa0 Retaliation\nIn this Policy, retaliation is any materially adverse action taken against an individual because the individual has: (1) openly opposed a policy or practice the individual believed was a violation of this Policy or state or federal anti-discrimination law; (2) engaged in protected activity such as making a request for a reasonable accommodation; (3) participated in the investigation or resolution of a report or complaint under this Policy; or, (4) in the case of Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, refused to participate in any manner in the investigation or resolution of a report or complaint under this Policy. There must be a sufficient causal nexus between the protected activity and the adverse action.\nF.\xc2\xa0Reports and Complaints\nA \"report\" under this Policy is a communication to OIE regarding a potential violation of this Policy suffered by another person. An \"initial complaint\" under this Policy is a communication submitted by the person who believes that they have directly suffered a violation of this Policy. A \"formal, written complaint\" is a signed, written document that includes the totality of allegations to be investigated by an ART. All reports, initial complaints, and formal, written complaints are processed under the Procedure for Reviewing Reports and Complaints.\nG. Advisor\nIn Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, an Advisor is a person chosen by a party or appointed by the University to accompany a party to meetings related to the Policy process, and to conduct cross-examination for the party at the hearing, if any. An Advisor may be an employee or non-employee of the University.\nH. Investigator\nIn all matters under this Policy, the Investigator is the person charged by the University with gathering facts about an alleged violation of this Policy, assessing the relevance of those facts, and preparing a report as described in the processes stated in this Policy. The Investigator serves as the principal individual in the Administrative Review Team (ART) for purposes of interviewing witnesses, gathering facts, and preparing the report.\nI.\xc2\xa0 Responsible Administrator\nIn this Policy, the Responsible Administrator is typically the University official with authority to implement the recommendations of an Administrative Review Team (\"ART\"), or in the case of a Title IX Sexual Harassment grievance proceeding the University official with authority to implement the decisions and sanctions of the hearing officer. In cases where the respondent is a University employee, the responsible administrator is usually the direct supervisor of the respondent. In cases involving a student or graduate student as respondent, a representative of the Office of Student Life or the Graduate School, respectively, is the Responsible Administrator. In cases involving a student or graduate student as complainant, a representative of the Office of Student Life or the Graduate School may be on the ART as an additional Responsible Administrator, if requested by OIE. In cases where the respondent is a vendor, guest, or visitor, the official with authority over the applicable area or department where the conduct occurred will usually serve as the Responsible Administrator. During the investigation process, the Responsible Administrator sits with the Investigator during interviews, reviews evidence gathered by the Investigator, and reviews and provides input on the reports drafted by the Investigator.\nJ.\xc2\xa0 Deciding Administrator (non-Title IX Sexual Harassment cases only)\nOnly non-Title IX Sexual Harassment proceedings will have a Deciding Administrator. In those cases, the Deciding Administrator is always a University official with authority to implement the recommendations of an ART, and is usually the direct supervisor of a respondent who is an unclassified University employee. For University Support Staff (USS) employees who are respondents, the Deciding Administrator is the Director of Employee Relations and Engagement (DER). In cases involving an undergraduate student as respondent, the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Life is the Deciding Administrator. In cases involving a graduate student as respondent, the Dean of the Graduate School is the Deciding Administrator. The Deciding Administrator will often serve as the Responsible Administrator for the same complaint. A Deciding Administrator does not serve as the Appeal Administrator regarding the same complaint, except in the case of USS employees as respondents. In cases where the respondent is a vendor, guest, or visitor, the official with authority over the applicable area or department where the conduct occurred is the Deciding Administrator.\nK. Hearing Officer\nOnly Title IX Sexual Harassment cases have a Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer oversees the hearing. The Hearing Officer may ask questions of witnesses and will rule on whether questions are permissible. After the hearing, the Hearing Officer will issue a written determination of responsibility. The Hearing Officer is designated by the University, and may be an employee or non-employee of the University.\nL.\xc2\xa0 Appeal Administrator\nIn non-Title IX Sexual Harassment proceedings, the Appeal Administrator is the direct supervisor of the Deciding Administrator, except in the case of USS employees as respondents. In non-Title IX proceedings, if the University President is the Deciding Administrator, then there is no appeal available.\nIn Title IX Sexual Harassment proceedings, the Vice President of Student Life or designee will review and decide on any appeal submitted to the Title IX Coordinator by a student, and the Provost or designee will review and decide on any other appeals submitted to the Title IX Coordinator, except in the case of USS employees as respondents. If the Provost is a respondent, then the President will be the Appeal Administrator. If the President is a respondent, then the Title IX Coordinator will designate an Appeal Administrator.\nFor all cases in which USS employees are respondents, the Peer Review Committee evaluates an appeal based upon the same standards required of Appeal Administrators, makes a written recommendation to the Director of Employee Relations (DER), and the DER makes the final decision.\n.030 Procedure for Reviewing Reports and Complaints\nStep 1: The Initial Complaint or Report.\nReports or initial complaints may be submitted to OIE.\nAny person making a report or initial complaint under this Policy may either (a) submit it to the Office of Institutional Equity; or (b) submit it to the head of the department or unit in which the conduct occurred, but if that person\'s conduct is the reason for the report or initial complaint, then submit the report or initial complaint to the next higher level of supervision. Students and graduate students respectively may also submit their initial complaint to the Office of Student Life or to the Graduate School.\nAll reports or initial complaints received by administrators, and by supervisors for potential Policy violations within their area of supervision,\xc2\xa0must\xc2\xa0be submitted to OIE as soon as practicable in accordance with Section C, above; however, anyone may submit a report or initial complaint directly to OIE.\nIn cases of Title IX Sexual Harassment, any person making a report or initial complaint may also submit it directly to the Title IX Coordinator. If the report or initial compliant is submitted to the Office of Institutional Equity or a supervisor for potential Policy violations within their area of supervision, the individual who receives the report shall send the report to the Title IX Coordinator.\nIt is important for all persons to preserve any relevant evidence related to a report, initial complaint, or complaint.\nThe initial complaint or report may be oral or written. It should include as much information as possible regarding the alleged conduct, including but not limited to: the dates and locations of the conduct; the persons involved; the effect the conduct has had on employment, learning or living environment or the complainant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to participate in university programs or activities; and the name and title of the person alleged to have engaged in the conduct.\nIn the event that a person discusses a sexual violence, domestic or dating violence, or stalking matter with a Center for Advocacy Response and Education (\"CARE\") staff member, the CARE staff member should consult with complainant, with the understanding that the CARE staff member may, but is not obligated to make a report to OIE or other appropriate University body unless there is an imminent risk of future harm. The CARE staff member will explain this Policy and that OIE is the point of contact for implementing this Policy to the person, encourage the person to make a report under the Policy, and ask whether the person would prefer keeping the information undisclosed by not referring it for processing by OIE. The University encourages reporting to OIE whenever the matter involves prohibited conduct under this Policy, so that it can process the matter under this Policy. Regardless of whether the information results in processing under this Policy, CARE will provide support and advocacy services to the extent feasible. Although this Policy protects confidentiality by limiting knowledge of complaints to those persons with a need to know, the University cannot ensure complete confidentiality.\nIf a person believes that criminal conduct has occurred, then the person should report that conduct to local law enforcement. CARE staff should also encourage the person to file a complaint with the police and will provide assistance in doing so if asked. The CARE staff member will also advise the person that he/she/they may decline to notify the police directly. The criminal justice system and this Policy are separate procedures, however, and complaints/reports must be made under both procedures if a complainant wants both processes to go forward. Persons may also request a protection from abuse order from a court under the Protection from Stalking Act, K.S.A. 60-31a01, et seq. KSU police will enforce such orders on campus.\nStep 2: Initial Determination Regarding Jurisdiction and Validity\nAll reports and initial complaints are processed by OIE. Upon receipt of a report or initial complaint, OIE makes an initial evaluation to determine if there is jurisdiction to investigate a violation of this Policy, and whether the alleged conduct, if true, would constitute a violation of this Policy, and determines the appropriate process.\nIf there is no jurisdiction or if the allegations would not constitute a violation of this Policy, even if true, then OIE will notify the complainant that the circumstances do not warrant further review under this Policy. That notice will explain OIE\'s decision and refer the complainant to the appropriate University office, if any. This determination by OIE is final and not subject to further review within the University, except in cases alleging Title IX Sexual Harassment (as defined in this Policy). In those cases, complainants may appeal under the procedures described in this Policy.\nIf there is jurisdiction and if the allegations would constitute a violation if true, then OIE will move forward to form an Administrative Review Team (ART) as described in Step 3.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if additional facts are needed before making the determination regarding jurisdiction and/or whether the conduct, if true, would constitute a violation of this Policy, then OIE may form an ART, which would then perform the initial evaluation as described in Step 4.\nStep 3: Formation of the Administrative Review Team\nIf OIE determines that a report or initial complaint warrants a review after OIE\'s initial evaluation, OIE will inform the appropriate Responsible Administrator(s), unless that person\'s conduct is the reason for the initial complaint. Depending on the circumstances, OIE may ask the president, provost and senior vice president, a vice president, an associate vice president, or a dean to designate the Responsible Administrator to serve on the ART. The OIE staff member and the Responsible Administrator(s) become the ART for the complaint. OIE staff members receive regular training regarding this Policy and how to conduct investigations under it, and they provide training to the other member(s) of the ART.\nStep 4: Administrative Review Team\'s Initial Evaluation of the Complaint\nThe ART will interview the complainant as soon as possible so that the ART members hear the initial complaint and get sufficient information to decide how to process it. If the ART determines after initial evaluation that there is no jurisdiction or the alleged conduct, even if true, would not constitute a violation of this Policy, then the ART will notify the complainant that the initial complaint does not warrant further review under this Policy. That notice will explain the ART\'s decision and refer the complainant to the appropriate University office, if any. This determination by the ART is final and not subject to further review within the University, except in cases alleging Title IX Sexual Harassment (as defined in this Policy). In those cases, complainants may appeal under the procedures described in this Policy.\nA complainant\'s failure or refusal to participate in the ART process may prevent the ART from investigating the alleged conduct.\nStep 5: Formal, Written Complaint\nIf the ART determines that the alleged conduct, if true, would constitute a violation of this Policy, the ART will obtain or produce a formal, written complaint and conduct a thorough, prompt, fair and impartial investigation, as set forth in the steps below. If the complainant does not prepare the formal, written complaint, then the ART will ask the complainant to read and, if necessary, to make corrections for accuracy and sign the formal, written complaint.\nIn Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, if the complainant does not sign the formal, written complaint, the Title IX Coordinator may sign it. The Title IX Coordinator may decide whether to sign a formal, written complaint not signed by a complainant based on alleged conduct, surrounding circumstances, and the potential for continuing harm on campus or in a University education program or activity. An unsigned complaint must be dismissed; a signed complaint is further reviewed and processed under this Policy.\nIn Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, once filed, the ART may elect to dismiss a formal complaint if: (1) the complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegation therein; (2) the respondent is no longer enrolled at or employed by the University; or (3) specific circumstances prevent the ART from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein. In any of these circumstances, the parties will be notified in writing of the dismissal.\nIn non-Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, if the complainant does not sign the complaint, the ART processes the unsigned complaint based on the information available.\nIn all cases, if there are multiple complaints based on the same set of facts and involving the same parties, the ART may elect to consolidate the cases for purposes of the investigation and, in Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, the hearing.\nStep 6: Investigation\nOnce the formal, written complaint is received, the ART will inform both parties in writing of the investigation and allow a full opportunity to be heard.\xc2\xa0 Both parties will be cautioned against making false statements, confidentiality and engaging in retaliation.\nThe ART will:\nMeet with the respondent to provide a copy of the complaint, explain procedures, caution against retaliation, ask the respondent questions pertaining to the complaint, provide an opportunity for respondent to provide an oral or written response within ten (10) calendar days, and inform the respondent that the review will proceed with or without the response;Receive, clarify and evaluate the respondent\'s response to the complaint, if a response is made; andInterview any persons with specific knowledge of the alleged incident(s) and review relevant policies, procedures, files, documents, and records.\nComplainants, respondents, and witnesses are generally not permitted to have an individual accompany them to interviews with the ART. If the investigation relates to alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, then the complainant and respondent may be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by one advisor. In these cases, the parties may select their own advisor or, if they do not have their own advisor, one will be made available to them by the University at no cost. The complainant and respondent shall provide prior notice to OIE that an advisor will attend any meetings and whether their advisor is an attorney. During investigation meetings, advisors (including attorneys) are not permitted to participate during the interview, other than to speak to their advisee. An advisor who disrupts the process (as determined by the ART) may be excluded from the interview. An investigation shall not be delayed more than one time on account of an advisor.\nStep 7(a):\xc2\xa0 Title IX Sexual Harassment Cases \xe2\x80\x93 Review of Evidence and Hearing\nIn Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, before the investigation closes, the ART will send the parties and their advisors an electronic copy of any evidence gathered during the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in the complaint. The parties will have equal opportunity to review the same evidence. After review of such evidence, each party will have 10 days to submit a written response to the evidence, which the ART will consider before finalizing the investigation report. If at any point before the close of the investigation the ART determines, based on a review of the information shared during the investigation, that the complaint, if true, would not constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment, then the complaint is reviewed in accordance with Step 7(b). In this circumstance, the parties will be notified in writing of the dismissal under Title IX Sexual Harassment.\nIf, at the close of the investigation, the ART determines, based on a review of the information shared during the investigation, that the matter includes claims of conduct that, if true, would fall under multiple definitions in this Policy, then the ART will determine whether the claims can be reasonably separated out for review and decision under the processes designated for those claims. If any of the claims include conduct that, if true, would constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the ART determines that the claims are so intertwined such that they cannot be reasonably separated out, then all claims will proceed under the Review and Evidence and Hearing for Title IX Sexual Harassment.\nAfter the parties have had an opportunity to review the evidence and submit their written responses, the ART will issue a written report that fairly summarizes the investigation. This report will be sent to the parties and their advisors at least 10 days prior to the scheduled hearing.\nAfter the ART issues its report to the parties, OIE will schedule a live hearing. OIE will schedule hearings based on the availability of the complainant, respondent, witness(es), and advisors. Student availability for a hearing is determined based on academic class schedules. Employee availability will be coordinated based on responsibilities, including teaching schedules for faculty. Absent exigent circumstances, lack of availability based on upon personal matters or employment schedules are not considered in scheduling the hearing. If a party selects his or her own advisor, that individual should be someone whose schedule allows attendance at the scheduled date and time for the hearing without unreasonable delay.\nThe hearing may take place in person or by remote means at the discretion of the Office of Institutional Equity. If the hearing takes place in person, the complainant or respondent may request that any cross-examination of the parties occur with the parties in separate rooms but appearing by remote means. Hearings will be conducted in private. The complainant, respondent, and advisors will be allowed to attend the entire portion of the hearing at which information is presented. Admission of any other individual to the hearing is at the discretion of the Hearing Officer. All attendees are expected to adhere to reasonable rules of decorum as set out by the Hearing Officer. There will be a single recording of the hearing, which will be maintained by the University and will be made available for the parties to review following the conclusion of the hearing. The parties shall not separately record the hearing.\nThe University may set out procedures for the hearing that are in addition to those articulated directly in this Policy. Absent those procedures published by the University, the Hearing Officer maintains discretion about how to conduct the hearing so long as it meets the requirements set out in this section.\xc2\xa0 During the hearing, the Hearing Officer may pose questions directly to any individual providing information in the hearing, subject to the evidentiary standards provided by the hearing officer. Each party\xe2\x80\x99s advisor may also ask the other party and any witnesses relevant questions directly, orally, and in real time. The Hearing Officer will determine whether such questions are relevant.\nDuring the hearing, questioning and evidence regarding a Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent.\nIf a party or witness does not submit to questions at the live hearing, the Hearing Officer must not rely on any statement of that party or witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility. The Hearing Officer will not draw an adverse inference based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to submit to questions at the hearing.\nWithin 30 days after the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall issue a written determination of responsibility utilizing a preponderance of the evidence standard. The written determination shall include the following:\nDescription of the allegations at issue;Description of the procedural steps taken throughout the case;Findings of fact supporting the determination;Conclusions regarding application of this Policy;A statement and rationale as to the determination of each allegation;A statement of any disciplinary sanctions and whether any remedies will be provided to the complainant; and\nA description of the procedures and permissible grounds for appeal.\nStep 7(b): Non-Title IX Sexual Harassment Cases - Determination and Written Report\nThe ART will consider all of the information it gathered and decide whether or not the respondent violated this Policy, based on the preponderance of the evidence. Possible outcomes of the review are either: (1) a finding of no violation of this Policy; or (2) a finding of violation of this Policy. If the ART determines that the respondent did not violate this Policy, it will provide the complainant, the respondent, and the Deciding Administrator a written report that describes the review, makes findings of fact and any recommendations, and describes what the complainant must to do to file an appeal. If the ART determines that the respondent violated this Policy, it will prepare a written report to the Deciding Administrator that describes the review, makes findings of fact, and provides recommendations for sanctions (and, if applicable, remedial actions, referrals, and follow-up). The complainant and the respondent shall be provided a copy of the written report at the same time as the Deciding Administrator.\nThe time required for reviews will vary; however, the goal is to complete reviews within 90 calendar days. But many factors, such as availability of witnesses and responsiveness of the parties or witnesses, can increase the time required for an investigation. Complainants and respondents may request a status update from OIE at any time.\nIf the ART determines that this Policy was violated, then the ART will make a recommendation regarding sanctions in its written report. The Deciding Administrator decides the sanctions and is responsible for ensuring compliance with the sanctions. Within ten (10) calendar days from the date the ART\xe2\x80\x99s written report was issued, the complainant and respondent may submit written comments to the Deciding Administrator regarding the ART report. Decisions on sanctions should be made in a timely fashion after the expiration of the ten (10) day comment period, and preferably within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the ART\xe2\x80\x99s report. Once sanctions are decided, they shall be implemented immediately, regardless of whether the complainant or respondent intends to appeal.\nIf the Deciding Administrator determines, based on the written submissions during the comment period and the ART\xe2\x80\x99s file, that the ART\xe2\x80\x99s Policy violation determination was clearly erroneous, as defined in Step 8, then the Deciding Administrator shall remand the matter back to the ART for further investigation and shall provide the ART, complainant, and respondent with a specific written basis for the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d determination. The process then returns to Step 6. A decision to remand to the ART is not subject to appeal.\nDecisions should be made in writing, with copies to the complainant, respondent, OIE, and the Office of General Counsel. Decisions that impose sanctions should identify the appropriate Appeal Administrator and the ten-day period in which an appeal must be submitted.\nStep 8(a): Title IX Sexual Harassment Cases - Appeal\nIn Title IX Sexual Harassment cases, either party may appeal from:\nA determination not to investigate a complaint for lack of jurisdiction or because the alleged conduct, if true, would not constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment under the definition in this Policy; orThe Hearing Officer\'s written determination, in cases that proceed to a hearing under this Policy.\nThe appeal in writing must be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator within 10 days following the receipt of the applicable dismissal or determination. Upon receipt, the Title IX Coordinator shall provide the appeal to the appropriate Appeal Administrator. To succeed in an appeal, the appealing party must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, one of the following:\nThere was a procedural irregularity in the process that affected the outcome;There is new evidence that was not reasonably available during the investigation and hearing that could have affected the outcome; orA conflict of interest or bias existed with the Title IX Coordinator, the members of the ART, and/or the Hearing Officer, which affected the outcome.\nThe appeal must state every ground on which the appeal is based and include argument in support of the appeal. If a party submits an appeal, OIE will notify the non-appealing party. The non-appealing party may submit a written response to the appeal within 10 days of that notification.\nOn appeal, the Appeal Administrator does not conduct a new investigation. The Appeal Administrator may only decide whether the appealing party has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that one of the above grounds for appeal has been satisfied. Within 30 days of both parties having the opportunity to submit written materials regarding the appeal to the Title IX Coordinator, the Appeal Administrator shall issue a written decision to both parties and their advisors that describes the appeal and announces a decision and rationale. The Appeal Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s ruling is final and not subject to further review within the University.\nStep 8(b): Non-Title IX Sexual Harassment Cases - Appeal\nAppeal if No Violation Found\nIf the ART determines that there was no violation of this Policy, then the complainant may submit an appeal to the Deciding Administrator. That appeal must be submitted in writing to the Deciding Administrator within ten (10) days from the date the ART\xe2\x80\x99s written report was issued. The appeal must state every ground on which the appeal is based.\nOn appeal, the Deciding Administrator does not conduct a new investigation. The Deciding Administrator may only decide, based upon the written information presented and the ART\xe2\x80\x99s file, whether the ART\xe2\x80\x99s determination was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d (i.e., plainly in error). The Deciding Administrator will defer to the ART for all credibility decisions (e.g., who is telling the truth). If an error(s) was made that would not have changed the determination (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9charmless error\xe2\x80\x9d), then that error must be disregarded. In the event that a Deciding Administrator decides that an ART finding is clearly erroneous, the Deciding Administrator shall refer the matter back to the ART for further investigation and shall provide the ART with a specific written basis for the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d determination.\nIf the Deciding Administrator determines that the ART\xe2\x80\x99s findings are not clearly erroneous, then the Deciding Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s ruling is final and not subject to further review within the University.\nThe Deciding Administrator should rule on an appeal in a timely fashion, preferably within thirty (30) days after receipt of the appeal. Rulings should be made in writing, with copies to the complainant, respondent, OIE, and the Office of General Counsel.\nAppeal of a Sanction if Violation Found\nIf the Deciding Administrator imposes a sanction, then a written appeal by either the complainant or respondent may be submitted to the Appeal Administrator within ten (10) days from the date of the Deciding Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s written decision.\nA respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal must be in writing and the appeal must state every ground on which the appeal is based. A complainant\xe2\x80\x99s appeal must be in writing, must state every ground on which the appeal is based, and may appeal only the severity of the sanction(s).\nOn appeal, the Appeal Administrator does not conduct a new investigation. The appeal may only decide, based upon the written information, whether the ART\xe2\x80\x99s violation determination and/or the Deciding Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions were \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary and capricious.\xe2\x80\x9d This means that there must be no reasonable basis, under circumstances presented, to uphold the sanctions imposed by the Deciding Administrator. The Appeal Administrator must defer to the ART for all credibility decisions (e.g., who is telling the truth). A Deciding Administrator who follows the ART\xe2\x80\x99s recommended sanction will be presumed not to have acted arbitrarily or capriciously, unless conclusively demonstrated otherwise.\nIf the Appeal Administrator determines that the ART\xe2\x80\x99s Policy violation determination was arbitrary and capricious, then the Appeal Administrator shall remand the matter back to the ART for further investigation and shall provide the ART with a specific written basis for the \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary and capricious\xe2\x80\x9d determination. The process then returns to Step 6. A decision to remand to the ART is not subject to appeal.\nIf the Appeal Administrator determines only that the Deciding Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions are arbitrary and capricious, then the Appeal Administrator shall refer the matter back to the Deciding Administrator for further review and shall provide the Deciding Administrator with a specific written basis for the \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary and capricious\xe2\x80\x9d determination.\xc2\xa0 The process then returns to Step 9. A decision to remand to the Deciding Administrator is not subject to appeal.\nThe Appeal Administrator should rule on an appeal in a timely fashion, preferably within thirty (30) days after receipt of the appeal. Rulings should be made in writing, with copies to the complainant, respondent, OIE, and the Office of General Counsel. A ruling by the Appeal Administrator that affirms the Deciding Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not subject to further review within the University.\n.040 Additional Resources\nAt any point prior to or during the administrative review, OIE or the ART may refer either or both parties to the ombudspersons, Employee Assistance, Employee Relations, University Counseling Services, the Office of Student Life, Human Resources, the Center for Advocacy Response and Education (CARE), dean or department head, Mediation Services, or other persons deemed appropriate by the ART.\nInformation for students and employees about counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, legal assistance, and other services available for harassment, sexual harassment, and \xc2\xa0sexual violence victims both on-campus and in the community can be found at\xc2\xa0OIE\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0CARE.\nReports of criminal activity should be directed to applicable law enforcement as soon as possible, including:\nKansas State University Police Department http://www.k-state.edu/police/\nRiley County Police Department http://www.rileycountypolice.org/contact-us\nSalina Police Department https://www.salina-ks.gov/police\nOlathe Police Department http://www.olatheks.org/government/police\n.050 Discretion in Application\nThe University retains discretion to interpret and apply this policy in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable, even if the University\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation or application differs from the interpretation of the parties.\nDespite the University\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable efforts to anticipate all eventualities in drafting this Policy, it is possible unanticipated or extraordinary circumstances may not be specifically or reasonably addressed by the express policy language, in which case the University retains discretion to respond to the unanticipated or extraordinary circumstance in a way that is not clearly unreasonable.\nThe provisions of this Policy are not contractual in nature, whether in their own right, or as part of any other express or implied contract. Accordingly, the University retains discretion to revise this Policy at any time, and for any reason. The University may apply policy revisions to an active case provided that doing so is not clearly unreasonable.\n.060 Questions\nPlease refer questions regarding this Policy to the Office of Institutional Equity, telephone 785-532-6220.\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

Procedure\n.030 Sanctions\n.040 Additional Resources\n.010 Anti-Trafficking Policy\nConsistent with federal and State of Kansas statutes and regulations, Kansas State University has a zero tolerance policy on trafficking in persons. Forms of trafficking include the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. Trafficking also includes sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age.\nFederal law, state law, and this Kansas State University policy prohibit human trafficking. For Kansas State University programs that are federally funded and the estimated value of the supplies acquired or services required to be performed outside the United States exceeds $500,000 (\"a Qualifying Program\"), it is required by federal law that an anti-trafficking compliance program be in place for Kansas State University and any contractors or subawardees.\nKansas State University employees, and in the case of a Qualifying Program, any subawardees at any tier, or their employers, labor recruiters, brokers, or other agents, are prohibited from engaging in any trafficking-related activities referenced in FAR 22.1703(a), including but not limited to:\nusing misleading or fraudulent recruitment practices during the recruitment of employees, such as failing to disclose basic information or making material misrepresentations regarding the key terms and conditions of employment, including wages and fringe benefits, the location of work, living conditions and housing (if employer provided or arranged), any significant costs to be charged to the employee, and, if applicable, the hazardous nature of the work;charging employees recruitment fees;destroying, concealing, confiscating, or otherwise denying access by an employee to the employee\'s identity documents, such as passports or drivers\' licenses; and\xc2\xa0for portions of contracts and subcontracts:\nperformed outside the United States, failing to pay return transportation costs upon the end of employment, for an employee who is not a national of the country in which the work is taking place and who was brought into that country for the purpose of working on a U.S. Government contract or subcontract;\xc2\xa0failing to pay return transportation costs upon the end of employment, for an employee who is not a national of the country in which the work is taking place and who was brought into that country for the purpose of working on a U.S. Government contract or subcontract, if the payment of such costs is required under existing temporary worker programs or pursuant to a written agreement with the employee; andother specific activities that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Council identifies as directly supporting or promoting trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor in the performance of the contract or subcontract.The requirements set forth in section (iv)(a) and (b) shall not apply to the following:an employee who is legally permitted to remain in the country of employment and who chooses to do so; oran employee who is a victim of trafficking and is seeking victim services or legal redress in the country of employment, or an employee who is a witness in a trafficking-related enforcement action.\n.020 Procedure\nTo prevent human trafficking and to comply with federal law, Kansas State University employees, and in the case of a Qualifying Program, any subawardees at any tier, or their employers, labor recruiters, brokers, or other agents, must do the following:\nReport any suspected trafficking activity in a Kansas State University program or activity to the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE). That office can be reached at (785) 532-6220 and equity@k-state.edu. Additional reports can be made to the Global Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-844-888-FREE and its email address at help@befree.org. Individuals are protected from acts of retaliation for reporting concerns or suspected wrongful conduct in good faith, consistent with applicable federal and state laws and university policy. University employees are also required to report to the campus police or other appropriate law enforcement agencies any incidents of child sexual abuse, meaning those crimes defined in K.S.A. 21-5501, et seq. that relate to minors as victims, which they witness on the University\'s campus or at a University-sponsored event;Cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to allow contracting agencies and other responsible enforcement agencies to conduct audits, investigations, or other actions to ascertain compliance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), Executive Order 13627, or any other applicable law or regulations establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor. Violations of this Policy for activities funded by federally funded grants, contracts and agreements, may require additional reporting to and cooperation with federal sponsoring agency officials. Reports of potential and actual trafficking situations involving federal funding will also involve coordination with the Offices of the Vice President for Research to ensure compliance with grant and contract requirements.Post the useful and relevant contents of this Policy, and any required project specific plans or related materials, on websites and in overseas workplaces; and\xc2\xa0For a Qualifying Program, contact the Kansas State University Office of the Vice President for Research and create a tailored compliance plan specific to the Qualifying Program, and if requested, a copy of the project specific plan shall be provided to the federal Agreement Officer. Qualifying Program specific compliance plans must be appropriate to the size and complexity of the externally funded project and to the nature and scope of the activities to be performed. These project specific plans must include, at a minimum, the following:\nAn awareness program to inform employees about the trafficking-related prohibitions included in this provision, the activities prohibited, and the action that will be taken against an employee for violations;A reporting process for employees to report, without fear of retaliation, activity inconsistent with the Policy prohibiting trafficking, including a means to make available to all employees the Global Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-844-888-FREE and its email address at help@befree.org;A recruitment and wage plan that only permits the use of recruitment companies with trained employees, prohibits charging of recruitment fees to the employee, and ensures that wages meet applicable host-country legal requirements or explains any variance;A housing plan, if Kansas State University or any of its contractors or subawardees intends to provide or arrange housing. The housing plan is required to meet any host-country housing and safety standards; andProcedures for Kansas State University to prevent any of its contractors and subawardees at any tier and at any dollar value from engaging in trafficking in persons activities described in applicable federal agency regulatory guidance. Qualifying Programs must have procedures to monitor, detect, and implement appropriate sanctions, including termination, of any contractor, agent, subawardee, or subawardee\xe2\x80\x99s employee who has engaged in such activities.\nUpon receiving a report, OIE will conduct a timely investigation, to the extent practicable, to determine whether a violation of this Policy has occurred regarding a University employee or University program, including Qualifying Programs. In consultation with the Office of General Counsel (OGC), OIE will prepare a report of its findings and will provide that report to the appropriate University administrator(s) for further decision making.\nIf OIE determines at any time that there is credible information indicating that FAR 22.1703(a) may have been violated in a Qualifying Program, OIE will inform the Vice President for Research. The Vice President for Research will take appropriate steps to comply with federal law, including, but not limited to, notifying the agency Inspector General.\n.030 Sanctions\nAny violations of this Policy may include disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment and termination/suspension of the contractor or subawardee relationship, as well as remedies imposed pursuant to federal contracting regulations.\nFurthermore, suspected violations will be referred to law enforcement and/or the appropriate federal agency, and may result in criminal penalties under state and federal law.\n.040 Additional Resources\nKansas State University Contact\nOffice of Institutional Equity103 Edwards Hall1810 Kerr DriveKansas State UniversityManhattan, KS 66506785-532-6220785-532-4807 TTYequity@k-state.edu\nState of Kansas Contact\nAnti-Human Trafficking Unit, Office of the Attorney General120 SW 10th\xc2\xa0Ave., 2nd\xc2\xa0FloorTopeka, KS 66612-15971-800-828-9745\nThe State of Kansas Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office maintains resources addressing human trafficking.\nHomeland Security Website on Human Trafficking (includes awareness training information).\nRelevant Statutes and Regulations\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act (78 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7101, et seq.)Combating Trafficking in Persons (FAR Subpart 22.1700, et seq.)Combating Trafficking in Persons (FAR Subpart 52.222-50, et seq.)Human trafficking, aggravated human trafficking (K.S.A. 21-5426)Commercial sexual exploitation of a child (K.S.A. 21-6422)Restitution (K.S.A. 22-3424)Civil damages (K.S.A. 60-5003)\nIf you believe you have information about any potential trafficking situation or would like to request information, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) via the toll-free hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or submit a tip online through the NHRTC anonymous online reporting form.

2013\nTable of Contents\n.010 Scope\n.020 Background\n.030 Legal Requirements\n.040 Policy\n.050 Responsibilities\n.060 Implementation\n.070\xc2\xa0Questions\n.010 Scope\nFederal law requires that Universities provide equal educational opportunities for all students, including students with disabilities. This Course Accessibility Standards Policy provides guidance for ensuring that all course delivery methods utilizing technology (eLearning) are accessible to student with disabilities.\n.020 Applicability\nMany of the courses offered at Kansas State University use technology to enhance course delivery, both on-campus and through distance learning (referred to as eLearning). The United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has stated that eLearning must be designed and delivered in such a way that all students, including students with disabilities, have equal access to course content.\nIn 2001, Kansas State University developed a memorandum detailing the University\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for creating accessible administrative, college, and department web pages. Accessible templates were developed for this purpose. Since 2001 the use of websites, web-based course management systems, and various technologies to routinely provide instruction to students has grown exponentially. Therefore, the Course Accessibility Standards Policy extends beyond the 2001 Web Accessibility Memorandum to include distance education and instructional websites as well as all eLearning course content.\xc2\xa0 This policy was approved by Faculty Affairs on May 15, 2007 and by the Faculty Senate on June 12, 2007.\n.030 Legal Requirements\nCollectively, State and Federal regulations require equal access to resources and materials for students who are otherwise qualified to enroll in the course. Furthermore, accessibility must be built into eLearning; OCR interpretation states that a University violates its obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act when it responds only on an ad-hoc basis to individual requests for accommodation. Finally, this instruction must result in a course-taking experience that is similar to that of students without disabilities.\nApplicable legislation includes:\nFederal Law:The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disabilitySection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which ensures that federally funded institutions such as Universities provide equal access to all services and programs, with or without accommodations.Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, which requires electronic and information technology to be accessible to persons with disabilitiesState of Kansas Information Technology Policy 1210 \xe2\x80\x93 State of Kansas Web Accessibility Requirements. This document is based on the Priority levels developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for developing accessible web sites. Kansas State University Memorandum outlining webpage accessibility requirements for administrative websites.\nMeeting Course Accessibility Standards for eLearning is best accomplished through the application of the principles of Universal Design to course development. Universal Design refers to the design of products, environments, and services to be \xe2\x80\x9cusable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for specialized design.\xe2\x80\x9d Much like curb cuts benefit more than mobility-impaired persons, electronic curb cuts provide benefits for the larger student population as well.\nOften, providing a single accommodation (such as a transcript for an audio course segment) provides benefits to many different persons with different disabilities and/or learning styles. The resulting Universal Access is effective for all students and is the best way for eLearning at Kansas State University to meet the needs of students with disabilities and to meet the demands of current and future technology.\n.040 Policy\nThis policy applies to all faculty and staff developing courses or course management systems for K-State or affiliates. All course delivery mechanisms and course content must be made accessible. This policy refers to new courses, new materials added to existing courses, and \xe2\x80\x9cretrofitting\xe2\x80\x9d of existing courses. In addition, software that is purchased and utilized in a course must also be accessible.\xc2\xa0 Making courses accessible may include, such actions as saving documents in a universal format such as Microsoft Word, providing a written transcript of audio content, or embedding a text description of graphics inserted into a PowerPoint slide or website.

Issuing a Declaration of Inclement Weather\n.040\xc2\xa0General Policy\n.045\xc2\xa0No Declaration of Inclement Weather Issued\n.050\xc2\xa0Questions\n.010 Purpose\nAs a condition of employment, all employees of Kansas State University, including all campuses, area extension offices, experiment stations, centers and fields, and instructors of off-campus courses, are expected to work at their assigned times and schedules regardless of weather conditions. It is recognized that severe weather conditions may prevent employees from reporting to work, cause late arrival, or require earlier departure than scheduled.\n.020 Procedures for Issuing a Declaration of Inclement Weather\nA Declaration of Inclement Weather may be made in the following manner:\nThe Governor may issue a Declaration of Inclement Weather for the entire State; or, as is more likely to be the case, for one or more geographic areas of the State. The Declaration will specify the area or areas covered, and the beginning and ending times of the Declaration.If a Declaration of Inclement Weather is issued by the Governor, the Governor's Office will communicate the Declaration to employees via the local news media.The President of Kansas State University as the agency head may issue a Declaration of Inclement Weather for the agency when the agency is located outside Shawnee County and the Governor has not issued a Declaration for that location.The head of a state agency may issue a Declaration of Inclement Weather for an area or areas outside Shawnee County when the agency has operations in that area or those areas and the Governor has not issued a Declaration for that area or those areas.\n.030 Kansas State University Procedures for Issuing a Declaration of Inclement Weather\nIn preparation for recommendation to the President, the Vice President for Administration and Finance shall make an assessment of weather conditions, including snow removal from streets, sidewalks and parking lots, hazards to employees traveling to and from the campus, and ability to provide energy. These observations shall be reported and a recommendation made to the President of the University. In the absence of the President, the Provost and Executive Vice President will be contacted for the decision.The President of the university shall advise the Vice President for Administration and Finance and the Vice President for Communications and Marketing of the decision. The Vice President for Communications and Marketing shall be responsible for disseminating information to campus offices on weather emergencies in addition to notifying media outlets of weather decisions. The Vice President for Communications and Marketing is also responsible for utilizing campus information services so that students, faculty and staff are informed of weather decisions in a timely manner. Employees and students are encouraged to listen to the local radio stations listed below for weather decisions and to check the university home page.\nWIBW 94.5 FM or 580 AMKMKF 101.5 FMKABI 1560 AMKQLA 103.5 FMKSAJ 98.5 FMKMAN 1350 AM or 93.3 FMKSAL 1150 AMKZBZ 104.9 FMKJCK 1420 AM or 97.5 FMKYEZ 94 FMKBLS 102.5 FMKACZ 96.3 FM\nThe President of the university delegates authority to the unit heads of area extension offices, experiment stations, centers, fields, K-State Salina, K-State Olathe, and the director of Global Campus for off-campus courses to declare an inclement weather emergency for those individual units. Unit heads are to notify the President and Provost and Executive Vice President of their decisions.\n.040 General Policy\nIn the event of a Declaration of Inclement Weather, K-State will close for non-essential state employees during the period of Inclement Weather and if school is in session, classes will be canceled during that time period. Benefits eligible non-essential employees who are scheduled to work shall be placed on Inclement Weather Leave, using the appropriate Inclement Weather leave earnings code for Time & Leave reporting: IWE for FLSA exempt employees and IWN for FLSA non-exempt employees.\xc2\xa0Each University unit is responsible for designating essential personnel, including such designation in their position description and communicating that designation to such personnel annually, prior to any Declaration of Inclement Weather.Employees on authorized leave, holidays, or off days are not affected by these emergency procedures and will continue in that status.Employees who have a remote work arrangement in place generally are not eligible for inclement weather leave. \xc2\xa0See PPM 4045 Remote Work Policy for more information.Those employees who work during a Declaration of Inclement Weather will receive compensation at the same rate of pay that the employee would have received had there not been a Declaration of Inclement Weather.Essential employees that work shall also receive inclement weather compensatory time (IWC) for the hours the employee works.\n.045 No Declaration of Inclement Weather Issued\nIf an employee is unable to work due to weather conditions and a Declaration of Inclement Weather has not been issued, they should follow their own department policy for reporting their absence. Employees not reporting to work, reporting to work late, or leaving early due to weather when a Declaration of Inclement Weather has not been declared will be expected to use vacation leave, accrued compensatory time, accrued holiday compensatory time, their discretionary holiday, or leave without pay. At the discretion of the department, employees may make up missed work time within the workweek. This policy does not affect the requirement that exempt employees must report leave in half- or full-day increments.\n.050 Questions\nQuestions regarding inclement weather should be referred to the Division of Human Resources at (785) 532-6277, the Vice President for Administration and Finance at (785) 532-6242 or the Division of Communications and Marketing at (785) 532-2535.\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23\""];

There are some university-related instances where a legal name may be required (e.g., sponsored research).\n.030 Procedures\nAn individual who adopts a chosen name that is different from that individual\xe2\x80\x99s legal name acknowledges that the chosen name is or will be actually used to identify that individual. Students submit their chosen name through KSIS. Employees submit their chosen name through a Human Capital Services form.\nThe university may revoke or deny a chosen name if a person\xe2\x80\x99s selection or use of a chosen name is for the purpose of, or results in, misrepresentation, misidentification, fraud, avoiding a legal obligation, libel, discrimination including harassment, threats, inciting violence, lewdness, obscenity, profanity, or promotion of commercial purposes. A chosen name in most cases shall not be a message, or company or group\xe2\x80\x99s name. A chosen name shall only consist of letters and shall not be unduly lengthy. The Office of the Registrar or Human Capital Services will determine if a chosen name is appropriate under these criteria for students and employees respectively.\nThe university recognizes an individual may choose a name other than their legal name more than once during their time at the university as they navigate decisions around their identity. Employees and students may change their chosen name one time per year absent necessary or extenuating circumstances, such as to reflect gender identity.\nUniversity Issued Identification Cards\nAn individual\xe2\x80\x99s chosen name will be printed on that individual\xe2\x80\x99s Kansas State University identification card. University ID cards are issued for the purpose of university business, and cards issued with chosen names shall not be used for voting identification, to obtain a state identification card, or for any other purpose for which a legal name is required.\nEmployees or students who update their chosen name after being issued an identification card can request a replacement card, subject to applicable charges.\nSystems and Processes\nKansas State University utilizes multiple systems to manage its operations and processes. Wherever possible, the university will modify systems to display only the chosen name. Instances in which a legal name is required include, but are not limited to, financial aid forms, tax forms, university transcripts, and health records.\nSince employees and students will be able to update their chosen names at any time throughout the year in the main enterprise systems, other university systems that are dependent on data that is primarily stored in the enterprise systems must be refreshed on a regular, scheduled basis as much as practical.\nUniversity employees with oversight responsibility of university information technology systems, who are unable to bring the applicable system in compliance with this Policy as related to employee and/or student chosen names, must develop a plan of action to articulate what is needed to bring that system into compliance. Those employees shall submit the plan to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and collaborate with the CIO or designee to reasonably resolve the matter to allow for the use of chosen names where legally permitted.\n.040 Sanctions\nIn addition to other remedial actions available for a Policy violation, the university may also deny or revoke the use of a chosen name based on violations of this Policy.\n.050 Questions\nFor student record questions:\nOffice of the Registrar,\xc2\xa0785-532-6254,\xc2\xa0registrar@k-state.edu\nStudent Support & Accountability and the LGBT Resource Center are also supportive resources for students with questions regarding the chosen name Policy.\nFor employee record questions:\nHuman Capital Services Resource Center,\xc2\xa0785-532-6277,\xc2\xa0hr@ksu.edu\nFor Campus ID card questions:\nK-State ID Center,\xc2\xa0785-532-6399,\xc2\xa0wildcatcard@k-state.edu\nFor Data System questions:\nOffice of the Chief Information Officer\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

2017\n.010 Introduction\n.020 Campus Security Authorities\n.030 Role and Reporting Responsibilities\n.040 Issuing Timely Warnings\n.050 Training\n.060 Multiple Reporting Obligations\n.070 Additional Resources\n.080 Questions\n.090 Policy Cross References\n.010 Introduction: Clery Act Designation, Reporting Policy, and Timely Warnings\nThis policy is intended to document the reporting obligations for students, faculty, staff, and individuals affiliated with K-State under Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, also known as the Clery Act (Clery Act), as well as the protocol for issuing timely warnings. This federal law applies to most public and private universities, and is tied directly to federal funding of various kinds, including federal student aid.\n.020 Campus Security Authorities\nDefinitions\nCampus Security Authority (CSA) is a Clery-specific term that encompasses four groups of individuals and organizations associated with an institution. CSAs are required by law to report four general categories of reported crimes of which they become aware if the reported crimes were alleged to have occurred in a Clery geographic location.\nCampus Security Authority means (i) A campus police department or a campus security department of an institution; (ii) Any other individual or individuals who have responsibility for campus security, such as an individual who is responsible for monitoring entrance into university property; (iii) An official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline, and campus judicial proceedings; and (iv) Any individual or organization specified in an institution\'s statement of campus security policy as an individual or organization to which students and employees should report criminal offenses.\nExemptions: Pastoral or professional counselors are not considered a Campus Security Authority when acting as a pastoral or professional counselor. The professional or pastoral counselors\xe2\x80\x99 exemption is intended to ensure that these individuals can provide appropriate counseling services without an obligation to report crimes they may have learned about through their work as a pastoral or professional counselor. This exemption is intended to protect the counselor-client role. However, even these legally recognized privileges acknowledge some exemptions, and there may be situations in which counselors are in fact under a legal obligation to report a crime. Crimes reported to a pastoral or professional counselor shall not initiate a Timely Warning.\nThe following groups of individuals have been identified as CSAs at K-State:\nUniversity Police: Any commissioned police officer employed by the university.Individuals with Campus Security Responsibility: Any individuals who have responsibility for campus security but do not constitute a campus police.Examples of this category are: Campus security officersOfficials who have significant responsibility for student and campus activities.An official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline, and campus judicial proceedings. Examples of this category are:University President and members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet that have significant responsibility for student and campus activitiesFaculty or staff advisors to registered student organizationsAthletic directors (ADs) including executive and associate athletic directorsAthletic Coaches including assistant coachesStaff across student affairs and housingVice President for Student Life and Deans of StudentsDirector of Student Life-Crisis ManagementDirector of New Student ServicesDirector of Community StandardsDirector of Fraternity and Sorority LifeAssociate/Assistant Director of Housing and DiningFull-time housing staffResident Assistants (RAs)Community Assistants (CAs) who monitor access to resident hallsResidential Learning Assistants (RLAs)Faculty and other employees who travel abroad with studentsAcademic DeansTitle IX Coordinator Administrators at branch campuses\nThis list of campus security authorities is subject to modification and is not intended to be all inclusive, due to changes in responsibilities within the university and varying job titles across campuses. Whether or not an individual is paid by the institution is not a factor in determining if that individual is a CSA.\n.030 Role and Reporting Responsibilities\nCampus Security Authorities (CSAs), are responsible for reporting any Clery Reportable Crime about which they have knowledge and that is alleged to have occurred within the K-State\xe2\x80\x99s Clery Geography (defined below).\nCSAs are expected to report Clery Reportable Crimes through the Campus Security Authority Reporting form found on the K-State Report It webpage as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours after receiving the information to the extent possible. A CSA or reporting party does not need to witness the reported crime and the persons involved do not need to be affiliated with K-State. CSAs also may be required to provide confirmation of the absence of reported incidents on a quarterly basis.\nCSAs are not responsible for determining if a crime took place, convincing the victim to contact law enforcement, investigating the alleged crime, or finding and/or arresting the alleged perpetrator, and should not engage in these activities. CSAs should record the reported information conveyed to them.\nWhen recording details for reporting purposes, the following information should be obtained:\nThe reporter\xe2\x80\x99s full nameThe reporter\xe2\x80\x99s affiliation (if any) with the university: (student, employee, not affiliated)The alleged perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s(s\xe2\x80\x99) name(s), if known, and any known facts related to the identity of the alleged perpetrator(s)The date or date range of the alleged crimeWhether the alleged crime reported is being reported by the alleged victim, a third party, or in another capacityThe date the alleged crime was reported to Campus Security AuthorityThe location of the crime, with as much detail as possible (address, building, floor, room, street, etc.)\nCampus Security Authorities, CSA are required to report the following alleged crimes (\"Clery Reportable Crimes\"):\nTypes of crimes:\n(A) Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter: The willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another.\n(B) Negligent Manslaughter: The killing of another person through gross negligence.\n(C) Sex Offenses: Any sexual act directed against another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent.\nRape: The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.Fondling: The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.Incest: Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law.Statutory Rape: Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent.\n(D) Robbery: Taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear.\n(E) Aggravated Assault: An unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury.

The University will issue a timely warning to members of the campus community when there is a report to a Campus Security Authority of a Clery Reportable Crime within the University\xe2\x80\x99s Clery Geography that the University considers a threat to students and employees. CSAs must promptly report information (include link to CSA reporting page) so K-State can determine whether a timely warning is necessary.\nFor the Manhattan campus, KSUPD and the Clery Act Federal Coordinator will consult with the Office of Student Life to review the reported facts of the case, and determine whether to issue a timely warning, and if so, to coordinate its issuance and its contents with the Division of Communications and Marketing. For K-State Salina, the Safety and Security department will generally consult with the Office of Academic and Student Services and the Clery Act Federal Coordinator in coordination with the Division of Communications and Marketing to perform these functions. For the Olathe campus, Olathe Security and Facilities will generally consult with Olathe Academic and Student Services, the Clery Act Federal Coordinator, the Manhattan campus Office of Student Life, and the Division of Communications and Marketing to perform these functions. Decisions will be made in light of all the pertinent facts surrounding the alleged crime, such as the nature of the alleged crime, the potential of a continuing danger or threat to the campus community, possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts, and the privacy of the alleged victim, the ability of the warning to aid in the prevention of similar crimes, and the relationship to Clery Geography.\nTimely Warnings may take the form of a press release, posted material, through the automated calling or the campus emergency notification system, and other dissemination processes identified by campus administration as applicable to the situation.\n.050 Training\nAll K-State Campus Security Authorities (CSAs) are expected to complete annual online, training. Additional training may be assigned dependent on the individual\xe2\x80\x99s employment or affiliation to the university system. In-person training may also be required and/or requested for individuals and groups.\n.060 Multiple Reporting Obligations\nPlease note that CSAs have distinct reporting obligations from other mandated reporters. In most states, including Kansas, professionals who engage in regular contact with children under the age of 18 are defined as mandatory reporters. Typically, mandatory reporting applies to people who have reason to suspect the abuse or neglect of a child, but it can also apply to people who suspect abuse or neglect of a dependent adult or the elderly.\nMoreover, under K-State\xe2\x80\x99s anti-discrimination policy (PPM 3010), the term \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible employee\xe2\x80\x9d applies to individuals that must report information about discrimination (which may overlap with a Clery Reportable Crime), including harassment and sexual violence, to the Office of Institutional Equity Supervisors (over the area in which they supervise) and administrators are responsible employees under PPM 3010 (more information can be found under Responsible Employees/Confidential Employees here: https://www.k-state.edu/oie/faqs.html).\nAdditionally, all employees are obligated to report threatening or violent behavior in accordance with the terms and requirements set out in the University\xe2\x80\x99s Threat Management Policy (PPM 3015).\nTherefore, CSAs may have reporting obligations that are in addition to the reporting obligations resulting from their status as a CSA.\n.070 Additional Resources\nAdditional information about Clery compliance, and the annual security report for each campus be found at: https://www.k-state.edu/report/\n.080 Questions\nInformation for students and employees regarding this policy, CSA designations, or the Clery Act in general may be directed to the Clery Act Compliance Coordinator at ksuclery@ksu.edu.\n.090 Policy Cross References\n3010 Policy Prohibiting Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Harassment, and Procedure for Reviewing Complaints\n3015 Threat Management Policy and Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) Processhttps://www.k-state.edu/studentlife/policies/cirt/\n3320 Division of Communications and Marketing\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

General Policy\n.030 Appropriate Use\n.040 Confidentiality and Privacy\n.050 Responsible Use of Library-provided Electronic Content\n.060 Training\n.070 Reporting Violations\n.080 Sanctions\n.090 Questions\n.010 Overview and Purpose\nThis document constitutes a University-wide policy for the appropriate use of all\xe2\x80\xaf University\xe2\x80\xaf computing and network resources. This policy is subject to all applicable laws and regulations. It is intended to reflect industry standards with regard to data security, technology, and intellectual property (IP) protection and to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal requirements. It is also intended to complement the other University policies on information technology usage and data security. See PPM 3400-3495.\n.020 General Policy\nAccess to K-State networks and computer systems is granted subject to University and Kansas Board of Regents policies and local, state, and federal laws.\nIt is the responsibility of each individual who has access to K-State networks and computer systems to ensure that their activity will not intentionally have a negative impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of all K-State computing and network resources.\nThe University is not responsible for inappropriate or unethical use of the information technology environment, including networks and computer systems.\nPolicy violations shall be reported (see section .070 Reporting Violations).\n.030 Appropriate Use\nAuthorized users are:\nAll provisioned eID holders, including those who have been granted a special access eID (see the K-State eID Policy, PPM Chapter 3450).Anyone connecting from a public information service.Others whose access furthers the mission of the University and whose usage does not interfere with other users' access to resources.\nIn addition, a user must be specifically authorized to use a particular computing or network resource by the campus unit responsible for operating the resource.\nAppropriate use of University IT resources shall:\nBe for the purposes of furthering the mission of the University.Be for the purposes for which they are assigned.Be in accordance with all license and contractual agreements to which the University is a party.Not install or use peer-to-peer software or software commonly used for unauthorized acquisition or distribution of copyrighted or licensed material on university computers or those attached to the university network.Comply with policies of any network over which such data or information must be routed to reach its final destination.Not interfere with the operation of University IT resources nor unreasonably interfere with the appropriate use of University IT resources by other users.Not indirectly violate this policy by using any device, software, or services of another network provider to circumvent the intent or meaning of this policy.Not compromise the security and confidentiality of data that is the property of University or any other user of University IT resources.Not attempt to circumvent or subvert any system's security measures.Not represent yourself electronically as another user.Not disrupt services, damage files, or intentionally damage or destroy equipment, software, or data belonging to the University or other users.Not be for personal purpose other than incidental and minimal use.Not be for private commercial use unless authorized by contract.Not intentionally misrepresent personal identity.Be in accordance with state and federal laws (includes such laws as FERPA, Gramm Leach Bliley Act, DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act), US copyright laws, and policies regarding the protection of data).Not conflict with or violate any other University or Kansas Board of Regents policy.\n.040 Confidentiality and Privacy\nWhile the University does not routinely monitor individual usage of its computing resources, the University may monitor the activity and access the accounts of individual users of University computing resources, including individual login sessions and communications, without notice, for any University purpose; there is no expectation of privacy for users. Some examples of monitoring and access include, but are not limited to:\nThe user has given permission or has voluntarily given access, for example, by posting to a publicly-accessible web page or providing publicly-accessible network services.It reasonably appears necessary to do so to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of the University or other computing resources or to protect the University from liability.There is reason to believe the user has violated, or is violating, this or any University policy.An account appears to be engaged in unusual or unusually excessive activity, as indicated by the reviewing of general activity and usage patterns.Normal operation and maintenance of the University's computing resources require the backup and caching of data and communications, logging of activity, reviewing of general usage patterns for the unauthorized disclosure of institutional data, scanning of systems and network ports for anomalies and vulnerabilities, and other such activities that are necessary to render service or to meet University legal obligations.It is otherwise required or permitted by law.\nAny such monitoring or access must be authorized in advance by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The CIO or CISO will work with the appropriate Cabinet-level administrator(s), and/or President before giving approval to proceed.\nThe University, in its discretion, through the CIO or CISO, may disclose the results of any such general or individual monitoring and information accessed, including but not limited to the contents and records of individual communications, to appropriate University personnel, and/or in reporting to appropriate authorities. The University also may use those results in University disciplinary proceedings and as the University otherwise deems necessary. Additionally, communications made by means of University computing resources are generally subject to the Kansas Open Records Act to the same extent as they would be if made on paper.\n.050 Responsible Use of Library-provided Electronic Content\nElectronic content made available by the K-State Libraries is provided through specific license agreements. These licenses describe who can use the resource, how it may be used, and the consequences of misuse. Excessive or systematic downloading may result in denial of access. While definitions differ, publishers generally consider multiple sequential chapters of a book or more than half of an entire issue of a journal excessive. Many licenses limit the use of materials to authorized users. Authorized users are K-State faculty, staff, and currently enrolled students. Sharing electronic resources with non-authorized users is prohibited. Sharing passwords, placing licensed materials on a publicly accessible website, and commercial use of licensed information is prohibited. Use of any Library electronic resources constitutes acceptance of K-State\xe2\x80\x99s Information Technology Usage Policy, PPM Chapter 3420.\n.060 Training\nAnnual cybersecurity and data protection training is provided for all users and mandatory for all K-State employees.\n.070 Reporting Violations\nAll users and units shall report unauthorized access attempts or other violations of this policy on K-State computers, networks, or other information processing equipment. If a user observes or learns of a security or abuse problem with any University computer or network facilities, including violations of this policy, the user should notify the Chief Information Officer (CIO), or the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\n.080 Sanctions\nPersons in violation of this policy are subject to the full range of sanctions, including but not limited to the loss of computer or network access privileges without notification, disciplinary action, dismissal from the University, and legal action. Some violations may constitute criminal offenses, as outlined in Kansas statutes and other local, state, and federal laws; the University will report such violations to the appropriate authorities.\nUnit heads have the authority to deny access, for unauthorized use, to K-State's network and computer systems under their control.\n.090 Questions\nQuestions regarding this policy should be sent to the Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer (CIO) or the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23\""];

2009; Revised January 9, 2023\nTable of Contents\n.010 Purpose\n.020 Scope\n.030 Effective Date\n.050 Policy\n.060 Definitions\n.070 Roles and Responsibilities\n.080 Implementation Procedures\n.090 Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\n.100 Questions/Waivers\n.010 Purpose\nAccess controls are the rules that an organization applies to control access to its information assets. The risks of using inadequate access controls range from inconvenience to critical loss or corruption of data. This policy defines access control standards for system use notices, remote access, and definition and documentation of trust relationships for K-State information systems.\n.020 Scope\nThis policy applies to all university colleges, departments, administrative units, and affiliated organizations that use university information technology resources to create, access, store or manage University Data to perform their business functions.\n.030 Effective Date\nThis policy became effective on August 26, 2009.\n.050 Policy\nAccess control standards for K-State information systems are to be established in a manner that carefully balances restrictions that prevent unauthorized access to information and services against the need for unhindered access for authorized users.\nSystem use notice - Before a user gains access to a K-State computer, a general system use notice must be displayed that welcomes users and identifies it as a K-State system, warns against unauthorized use of the computer, and indicates that use of the system implies consent to all relevant K-State policies. The general system use notice should also be displayed before a user gains access to a K-State information system, where practical. The system use notice must state the following:Welcome to Kansas State University\'s information technology resources. Access to this system and all other electronic resources at K-State is restricted to employees, students, or individuals authorized by the University or its affiliates. Use of this system constitutes agreement to abide by all relevant K-State policies. Unauthorized or inappropriate use may result in limitation or revocation of use privileges and/or administrative, civil, or criminal penalties.Remote access - Remote access control procedures must provide appropriate safeguards through appropriate identification, authentication, and encryption techniques. Direct log-on to campus computers from off-campus locations is not allowed. A remote user must first authenticate to an authorized campus remote access service with strong encryption, such as K-State\'s VPN service or a departmental Windows Terminal Services (i.e. Remote Desktop Services) or Secure Shell (ssh) server, before logging into a campus computer. This restriction does not apply to authenticated user access to web applications like KSIS, K-State Online, Webmail, or to systems designed for public access.For additional security controls for remote access, see Data Security Standards in K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy.Trust relationships - Trust relationships for centrally-managed University information systems or any system with confidential data must be defined and documented, approved by an appropriate authority, and periodically reviewed and revised as needed. Security controls, such as firewall rulesets, must be configured to enforce the trust relationships.Two-factor authentication - The process of confirming a person\xe2\x80\x99s identity using multiple pieces of evidence to verify who they are when accessing systems. This evidence is typically something they know, such as a username and password, and something they have, such as a device with a code or app.\n.060 Definitions\nAuthenticationProcess of verifying one\'s digital identity. For example, when someone logs into a workstation or server with their eID, the password verifies that the person logging in is the owner of the eID. The verification process is called authentication.Confidential DataHighly sensitive University Data intended for limited, specific use by a workgroup, department, or group of individuals with a legitimate need-to-know. See K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy for an expanded definition and examples.K-State ComputerAny computer considered to be the property of Kansas State University.Local NetworkAny segment of K-State\'s data network physically located on the Manhattan or Salina campus. This includes devices on the network assigned any routable and non-routable IP addresses, typically 129.130.X.X or 10.X.X.X, respectively, and applies to the wireless network and the network serving K-State\'s student residence halls and Jardine Apartments.Remote AccessAccessing a K-State local network from any physical location outside the Manhattan or Salina campus. This includes access from off campus using K-State\'s Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.Trust relationshipsA specification of the level of access granted to computer systems and/or applications that are trusted to access resources on a server and its associated data and applications. This applies to access controls between systems, not access rights for individual users or roles.University DataAny data related to Kansas State University (\"University\") functions that are:\nStored on University information technology systems.Maintained by K-State faculty staff, or students.Related to institutional processes on or off campus.This applies to any format or media (in other words, it is not limited to electronic data).Virtual Private Network (VPN)Povides a secure communication channel over the Internet that requires authentication to set up the channel and encrypts all traffic flowing through the channel.\n.070 Roles and Responsibilities\nChief Information Security Officer (CISO) - Responsible for developing guidance on documentation and approval of trust relationships.\n.080 Implementation Procedures\nThe System Use Notice should be passively displayed such that no user action is required to view it before logging into the K-State computer or information system.\n.090 Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\nAdditional K-State access control policies\nData access controls - Access controls based on data classifications are specified in K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy.Password security - Passwords are commonly used in conjunction with an identifying username to control access to information and information systems. K-State\'s password requirements are listed in K-State\'s Security for Information, Computing and Network Resources Policy.Unattended computers - Security controls for preventing unauthorized access to unattended computers are defined in K-State\'s Security for Information, Computing and Network Resources Policy.Vendor access - Access controls for vendors or other third parties who need to access K-State information systems for business reasons are defined in K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy.Other related laws, regulations, or policies\nK-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy.State of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Policy 7230 \xe2\x80\x93 Information Technology Enterprise Security PolicyISO/IEC 27002:2013: Information technology - Security techniques - Code of practice for information security management, published by the International Standards Organization. This is an international security standard that specifies security requirements for controlling access (see chapter 11, Access control) to ensure that access to information and information systems is limited to authorized users.\n.100 Questions/Waivers\nThe Vice President for Information Technology Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for this policy. The CIO or designee must approve any exception to this policy or related procedures. Questions should be directed to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

operation of K-State information systems and proper management of K-State\'s IT security program and technologies.\n.020 Scope\nThis policy applies to all university colleges, departments, administrative units, and affiliated organizations that use university information technology resources to create, access, store or manage University Data to perform their business functions.\n.030 Effective Date\nThis policy became effective on November 13, 2009.\n.040 Authority\nThe State of Kansas, ITEC \xe2\x80\xafInformation Technology Policy 5300, Revision 1: Business Contingency Planning, requires all state agencies, including Regents institutions, to develop \"business continuity plans to ensure that all entities can continue critical operations during any disruption and resume normal operations within a reasonable period of time.\"\nThe State of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Security Standards Policy 7230A (PDF), requires all State of Kansas branches, boards, commissions, departments, divisions, agencies, and third parties used to process transmit or provide business capabilities on behalf of Kansas state government to perform a risk assessment.\n050 Policy\nBusiness continuity plan - K-State must have a business continuity plan to guide recovery from disasters or other major disruptions to service in a manner that maintains the security of K-State information systems and ensures timely restoration of services.Configuration management - the configuration of servers, workstations, network devices, firewalls and other enterprise security technologies should be managed in a way that provides consistent setup, documents changes, and ensures security requirements are maintained when the configuration is changed.Data backups - University Data must be backed up regularly and backup media stored securely, commensurate with the classification of the data.FirewallsAll connections to networks outside the K-State campus, such as the Internet and Internet2, must be protected with a firewall that filters both incoming and outgoing network traffic against common threats.All enterprise information systems and any K-State system hosting confidential data must be protected by a network firewall and a host-based software firewall, both configured in \"default deny\" mode for incoming traffic and enforcing documented trust relationships for those systems.All university computers connected to the university network must have a host-based firewall configured appropriately for the security requirements of the system and the classification of data stored therein.Logging should be enabled for all firewalls and periodically reviewed for anomalous events.Configuration of network firewalls and host-based firewalls on enterprise information systems should be audited periodically to ensure consistency with the security requirements of the system(s) they protect.Security event logging and auditingAudit logs recording user activities, exceptions (i.e., errors or failures), and information security events should be generated commensurate with the security requirements of the system being monitored. Audit logs should be retained for at least 30 days.Enterprise information systems must log system administrator activities, such as the use of privileged accounts (e.g., supervisor, administrator, or root).Audit logs should be periodically reviewed to detect security violations.Security event log data must be protected against unauthorized access and alteration.Clocks of systems being monitored should be synchronized regularly from an accurate time source.Security management - K-State\'s IT security program and policies must be monitored and periodically assessed to ensure their continued effectiveness. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or designee must perform an annual IT security self-assessment and submit a summary report to the Kansas Board of Regents office, as required by state of Kansas information technology policy.\n.060 Definitions\nAuthenticationProcess of verifying one\'s digital identity. For example, when someone logs into Webmail, the password verifies that the person logging in is the owner of the eID. The verification process is called authentication.Confidential dataHighly sensitive data intended for limited, specific use by a workgroup, department, or group of individuals with a legitimate need-to-know. See\xc2\xa0K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy for an expanded definition and examples.Default DenyA firewall ruleset that begins with blocking all network traffic, both incoming and outgoing, then only allowing specific network traffic required for the effective and secure operation of the system(s) protected by the firewall.Enterprise information systemAn information system and/or server providing services commonly needed by the University community and typically provided by central IT units. Departmental information systems provide services specific to the mission and focus of individual Colleges, departments, administrative units, or affiliated organizations and are typically provided by distributed IT staff in those units.FirewallA specialized device or software program that controls the flow of network traffic between networks or hosts to enforce security policies and provide protection for the resources on those networks or hosts. For the purposes of this policy, a router with Access Control Lists (ACLs) is not considered a firewall.Trust relationshipsA specification of the level of access granted to computer systems and/or applications that are trusted to access resources on a server and its associated data and applications. This applies to access controls between systems, not access rights for individual users or roles.University ComputerAny computer considered to be the property of Kansas State University.University DataAny data related to Kansas State University (\"University\") functions that are:\nStored on University information technology systems.Maintained by K-State faculty staff, or students.Related to institutional processes on or off campus.This applies to any format or media (in other words, it is not limited to electronic data).University NetworkAny part of K-State\'s data network physically located on the Manhattan or Salina campus. This includes devices on the network assigned any routable and non-routable IP addresses, typically 129.130.X.X or 10.X.X.X, respectively, and applies to K-State\'s wireless network and the network serving K-State\'s student residence halls and Jardine Apartments.\n.070 Roles and Responsibilities\nChief Information Security Officer (CISO) - Coordinates the development of guidelines, standards, and/or procedures related to this policy as well as the identification, implementation, and assessment of common security controls needed for this policy; monitors and periodically assesses K-State\'s overall IT security program and policies; and ensures completion of an annual IT security self-assessment and report.Enterprise IT Security Analyst\xc2\xa0- Ensures the application of appropriate operational security controls for an information system; coordinates with the CISO in the identification, implementation, and assessment of common security controls; ensures that backups are being performed regularly and stored securely; and ensures that components of an information system have an appropriate system of configuration management in place. This role may be filled by someone directly involved with the development, maintenance, and/or operation of the information system.\n.080 Implementing Procedures\nSecurity event logging and auditingAudit logs should include the following information, when relevant:\neID or usernameDate and time of eventType of eventDescription of the eventNetwork addresses and protocols involvedFiles accessedCommands/processes executedK-State information systems should consider logging the following events and any others deemed appropriate for tracking important or suspicious actions:\nSuccessful and unsuccessful login or authentication attemptsAccess to confidential dataChanges to access privileges for confidential dataActivation and de-activation of security systems such as firewalls, anti-virus systems, and intrusion detection systems, and alerts from these systems.Privileged operations such as the use of privileged accounts (e.g., supervisor, administrator, or root), system start-up and stop, and I/O device attachment/detachment.System and network alerts and failure messages.Changes to, or attempts to change, system security settings and controls.\n.090 Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\nExisting K-State IT security operations and management policiesVulnerability management - K-State\'s requirements for assessing a system\'s security controls and identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities is in K-State\'s K-State\'s System System Development and Maintenance Security Policy, section .050.D.Other related laws, regulations, or policiesK-State\'s Data Classification and Security PolicyState of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Policy 5300, Revision 1: Business Contingency PlanningState of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Security Standards Policy 7230A, Revision 1: General Information Technology Enterprise Security Policy (PDF)ISO/IEC 27002:2013, Information technology - Security techniques - Code of practice for information security controls, published by the International Standards Organization.

Regulations, or Policies\n.100 Questions/Waivers\n.010 Purpose\nData and information are important assets of the university and must be protected from loss of integrity, confidentiality, or availability in compliance with university policy and guidelines, Board of Regents policy, and state and federal laws and regulations.\n.020 Scope\nThis policy applies to all university colleges, departments, administrative units, and affiliated organizations. For the purposes of this policy, affiliated organization refers to any organization associated with the University that uses university information technology resources to create, access, store, or manage University Data to perform their business functions. It also applies to any third party vendor creating, storing, or maintaining University Data per a contractual agreement.\n.030 Effective Date\nThis policy became effective on February 2, 2009\nAll new systems designed and implemented after September 1, 2009, must comply with the security standards in section .054 below. Data stewards must have a compliance plan for all systems with confidential data by January 1, 2011.\n.040 Authority\nThe State of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Security Standards Policy 7230A, Section 11 Data Protection Standard (PDF), requires state agencies, including Regents\' institutions, to employ mechanism(s) to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of Restricted-Use Information.\n.050 Policy\nAll University Data must be classified according to the K-State Data Classification Schema and protected according to K-State Data Security Standards. This policy applies to data in all formats or media.\n.052 Data Classification Schema\nData and information assets are classified according to the risks associated with data being stored or processed. Data with the highest risk need the greatest level of protection to prevent compromise; data with lower risk require proportionately less protection. Three levels of data classification will be used to classify University Data based on how the data are used, its sensitivity to unauthorized disclosure, and requirements imposed by external agencies.\nData are typically stored in aggregate form in databases, tables, or files. In most data collections, highly sensitive data elements are not segregated from less sensitive data elements. For example, a student information system will contain a student\'s directory information as well as their social security number. Consequently, the classification of the most sensitive element in a data collection will determine the data classification of the entire collection.\nK-State Data Classifications\nPublic - Data explicitly or implicitly approved for distribution to the public without restriction. It can be freely distributed without potential harm to the University, affiliates, or individuals. Public data generally have a very low sensitivity since by definition there is no such thing as unauthorized disclosure, but it still warrants protection since the integrity of the data can be important. Examples include:\nK-State\'s public web site.Directory information for students, faculty, and staff except for those who have requested non-disclosure (e.g., per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for students).Course descriptions.Semester course schedules.Press releases.Internal - Data intended for internal University business use only with access restricted to a specific workgroup, department, group of individuals, or affiliates with a legitimate need. Internal data are generally not made available to parties outside the K-State community. Unauthorized disclosure could adversely impact the University, affiliates, or individuals. Internal data generally have a low to moderate sensitivity. Examples include:\nFinancial accounting data that does not contain confidential information.Departmental intranet.Information technology transaction logs.Employee ID number (\"W0...\").Student educational records.Directory information.Confidential- Highly sensitive data intended for limited, specific use by a workgroup, department, or group of individuals with a legitimate need-to-know. Explicit authorization by the Data Steward is required for access because of legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints. Unauthorized disclosure could have a serious adverse impact on the business or research functions of the University or affiliates, the personal privacy of individuals, or on compliance with federal or state laws and regulations or University contracts. Confidential data have a very high level of sensitivity. Examples include:\nSocial Security Number.Student ID number (if it is the same as the Social Security Number).Credit card number.Personal identity information (PII). K.S.A. \xc2\xa7 21-6107: Crimes involving violations of personal rights\xc2\xa0defines PII as including, but not limited to: an individual\'s name; date of birth; address; telephone number; driver\'s license number or card or nondriver\'s identification number or card; social security number or card; place of employment;\xc2\xa0employee identification numbers or other personal identification numbers or cards;\xc2\xa0mother\'s maiden name;\xc2\xa0birth, death or marriage certificates;\xc2\xa0electronic identification numbers;\xc2\xa0electronic signatures; and\xc2\xa0any financial number, or password that can be used to access a person\'s financial resources, including, but not limited to, checking or savings accounts, credit or debit card information, demand deposit or medical information.\xc2\xa0For K-State\'s purposes, PII also includes ones name in combination with a passport number.Passport number.Personnel records.Medical records.Authentication tokens (e.g., personal digital certificates, passwords, biometric data).Proprietary Data - Classification of data provided to or created and maintained by K-State on behalf of a third party, such as a corporation or government agency, will vary depending on contractual agreements and/or relevant laws or regulations. The classification and security standards for proprietary data owned by the third party will be defined by the third party. Proprietary data owned by K-State must be classified and protected according to K-State\'s data classification policy and security standards. Individuals managing or accessing proprietary data are responsible for complying with any additional requirements and security policies and procedures specified by the third-party owner. Proprietary data include data classified by the federal government as Classified National Security Information (confidential, secret, top secret).\n.054 Data Security Standards\nThe following table defines required safeguards for protecting data and data collections based on their classification.

a set of rules in a network device, such as a router, that controls access to segments of the network. A router with ACLs can filter inbound and/or outbound network traffic similar to a firewall but with less functionality.AuthenticationProcess of verifying one\'s digital identity. For example, when someone logs into Webmail, the password verifies that the person logging in is the owner of the eID. The verification process is called authentication.AuthorizationGranting access to resources only to those authorized to use them.AvailabilityEnsures timely and reliable access to and use of information.Classified National Security InformationInformation that has been determined by the federal government to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form. There are three classifications - confidential, secret, and top secret (see White House Press Release: Classified National Security Information).ConfidentialityPreserves authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.FirewallA specialized hardware and/or software system with stateful packet inspection that filters network traffic to control access to a resource, such as a database server, and thereby provide protection and enforce security policies. A router with ACLs is not considered a firewall for the purposes of this document.IDSIntrusion Detection System; a system that monitors network traffic to detect potential security intrusions. Normally, the suspected intrusions are logged and an alert generated to notify security or system administration personnel.IntegrityGuards against improper modification or destruction of information, and ensures non-repudiation and authenticity.IPSIntrusion Prevention System; an IDS with the added ability to block malicious network traffic to prevent or stop a security event.Local NetworkAny segment of K-State\'s data network physically located on the Manhattan or Salina campus with an IP address starting with 129.130.X.X or an un-routable private IP address (e.g., 10.X.X.X).Remote AccessAccessing any K-State\'s local network from any physical location outside the Manhattan or Salina campus. This includes access from off campus using K-State\'s VPN service.Secure Data CenterA facility managed by full-time IT professionals for hosting computer, data storage, and/or network equipment with 24x7 auditable restricted access, environmental controls, power protection, and network firewall protection.Secure Servera computer that provides services to other computers, applications, or users; is running a server operating system; and is hardened according to relevant security standards, industry best practices, and K-State security policies.SensitivityIndicates the required level of protection from unauthorized disclosure, modification, fraud, waste, or abuse due to potential adverse impact on an individual, group, institution, or affiliate. Adverse impact could be financial, legal, or on one\'s reputation or competitive position. The more sensitive the data, the greater the need to protect it.University DataAny data related to Kansas State University (\"University\") functions that are:\nStored on University information technology systems.Maintained by K-State faculty staff, or students.Related to institutional processes on or off campus. This applies to any format or media (in other words, it is not limited to electronic data).VPNVirtual Private Network; a VPN provides a secure communication channel over the Internet that requires authentication to set up the channel and encrypts all traffic flowing through the channel.\n.070 Roles and Responsibilities\nEveryone with any level of access to University Data has responsibility for its security and is expected to observe requirements for privacy and confidentiality, comply with protection and control procedures, and accurately present the data in any type of reporting function. The following roles have specific responsibilities for protecting and managing University Data and Data Collections.\nChief Data Steward - Senior administrative officers of the university responsible for overseeing all information resources (e.g., the Provost and Vice Presidents).Data Steward - Deans, associate vice presidents, and heads of academic, administrative, or affiliated units or their designees with responsibility for overseeing a collection (set) of University Data. They are in effect the owners of the data and therefore ultimately responsible for its proper handling and protection. Data Stewards are responsible for ensuring the proper classification of data and data collections under their control, granting data access permissions, appointing Data Managers for each University Data collection, making sure people in data-related roles are properly trained, and ensuring compliance with all relevant polices and security requirements for all data for which they have responsibility.Data Stewards Council - A group of Data Stewards appointed by the Chief Data Stewards and Chief Information Officer to maintain the data classification schema, define University Data collections, assign a Data Steward to each, and resolve data classification or ownership disputes.Data Manager - Individuals authorized by a Data Steward to provide operational management of a University Data collection. The Data Manager will maintain documentation pertaining to the data collection (including the list of those authorized to access the data and access audit trails where required), manage data access controls, and ensure security requirements are implemented and followed.Data Processor - Individuals authorized by the Data Steward or designee and enabled by the Data Manager to enter, modify, or delete University Data. Data Processors are accountable for the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of data assigned to them.Data Viewer - Anyone in the university community with the capacity to access University Data but is not authorized to enter, modify, or delete it.Chief Information Security Officer - Provides advice and guidance on information and information technology security policies and standards.Internal Audit Office - Performs audits for compliance with data classification and security policy and standards.\n.090 Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\nKansas State University Policies\nCollection, Use, and Protection of Social Security NumbersUniversity Research Compliance Office\xc2\xa0for information on export controls, confidential/sensitive research data, human subjects, etc.Security for Information, Computing, and Network Resources\nState of Kansas\nK.S.A. \xc2\xa7 21-6107: Crimes involving violations of personal rights\xc2\xa0State of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Security Standards Policy 7320A (PDF).

3435\nRevised September 2, 2010, January 9, 2023\nTable of Contents\n.010 Purpose\n.020 Definitions\n.030 Policy\n.040 Questions\n.010 Purpose\nUniversity departments require access to official institutional data as an integral part of their operations. This access has traditionally been provided in the form of extracts or data files from the official university sources, downloaded to digital medium, and then used to update the decentralized data files kept by the departments. This method of file maintenance, while adequate for most department needs, leads to:\nAn alternative source for \"official\" University dataPotential for management decisions based on inaccurate dataPotential of reporting numbers which do not reflect the current numbers in the real-time system\nK-State launched an initiative in 2001 called the Integrated Information Initiative (III), which was designed to move the University toward integrating the data used by management to plan, make decisions, and support day-to-day operations. Among the initial goals of III were creation of an Integrated Database for consolidated data and consistent reporting.\nThe digital exchange of transaction data will be facilitated by a messaging software package called a Transaction Hub. This software functionality will synchronize systems in (near) real time. The data mapping from the Transaction Hub will be used to create access to the Integrated Database, whose design will replicate the design of the University (Enterprise) Data Model. In order for the benefits of III to be fully realized, data access from and transactional interaction with University systems will need to follow the policies stated below.\n.020 Definitions\nData MappingThe identification of data elements from two or more systems that have the same semantic meaning, but possibly different formats. Data mapping includes the necessary conversion of the data elements to the differing formats for the purpose of integration or migration.Integrated DatabaseA virtual database encompassing the University\'s data that has been included in the scope of the University \"Enterprise\" Data Model.Transaction HubA system that provides near real-time integration between systems with reusable interfaces and adapters. The transaction hub provides integration at the data level and at the process level, while also providing security, reliability, and efficiency.Transactional InteractionAn exchange or transfer of data between systems.University (Enterprise) Data ModelA data model consists of things of importance (entities), the properties of those things (attributes), and how they are related (relationships). The scope of the University Data Model spans the data of the entire university, regardless of the application systems where the data reside.\n.030 Policy\nAccess to the Integrated Database will be specifically authorized via the data access memorandum of agreement process (procedural agreements are attached), managed by Data and Information Administration Department. Permission for access by a secondary organization or individual will require an additional agreement or an addendum to the original.\nInteractive (near real-time) connections of departmental systems to institutional systems must have agreement of the principal data steward(s) affected via the memorandum of agreement process, and must connect by way of the Transaction Hub.\nOfficial reporting of institutional data must come directly from the source application system of record or directly from an authorized view of the official data from the Integrated Database.\n.040 Questions\nQuestions regarding this policy should be sent to the Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer (CIO).\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

Revised January 9, 2023\nTable of Contents\n.010\xc2\xa0Purpose\n.020\xc2\xa0Scope\n.030\xc2\xa0Effective Date\n.040\xc2\xa0Authority\n.050\xc2\xa0Policy\n.060\xc2\xa0Definitions\n.070\xc2\xa0Roles and Responsibilities\n.080\xc2\xa0Implementation Procedures\n.090\xc2\xa0Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\n.100\xc2\xa0Questions/Waivers\n.010 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to protect University Data from unauthorized disclosure. This policy defines the requirements for ensuring University Data are permanently removed from media before disposal or reuse, a process called \"media sanitization,\" and properly disposing of media. The reuse, recycling, or disposal of computers and other technologies that can store data pose a significant risk since data can easily be recovered with readily available tools - even data from files that were deleted long ago or a hard drive that was reformatted. Failure to properly purge data in these circumstances may result in unauthorized access to University Data, breach of software license agreements, and/or violation of state and federal data security and privacy laws.\n.020 Scope\nThis policy applies to all university colleges, departments, administrative units, and affiliated organizations.\n.030 Effective Date\nThis policy became effective July 24, 2009.\n.040 Authority\nThe State of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Security Standards Policy 7230A, Data Protection Standard and Physical Security Standard (PDF), instructs Regents\' institutions to disposed of in accordance\xc2\xa0with NIST Special Publication 800-88 \xe2\x80\x93 Guidelines for Media Sanitization or an approved established industry best practice for higher education technical environments or institutions\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 specifies requirements for disposal, media reuse, and accountability for electronic protected health information.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 1075: Tax Information Security Guidelines for Federal, State, and Local Agencies, specifies security controls for protecting the confidentiality of Federal Tax Information that includes media reuse and disposal.\n.050 Policy\nTo prevent unauthorized disclosure of University Data, media leaving control of the responsible department and destined for reuse or disposal must have all University Data purged in a manner that renders the data unrecoverable.\nMedia that will be reused within the department should likewise have all University Data purged to prevent unauthorized disclosure.\nMedia containing University Data authorized by the appropriate administrative head for transfer to individuals or organizations outside the University are exempt.\n.060 Definitions\nAffiliated OrganizationAny organization associated with the University that uses university information technology resources to create, access, store or manage University Data to perform their business functions.Confidential DataHighly sensitive University Data intended for limited, specific use by a workgroup, department, or group of individuals with a legitimate need-to-know. See K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy for an expanded definition and examples.DeGaussingDemagnetizing magnetic storage media like tape or a hard disk drive to render it permanently unusable. Since the media typically can no longer be used after degaussing, it should only be used to purge data from media that will be discarded.DisintegrationA physically destructive method of sanitizing data; the act of separating into component parts.HIPAAHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 that among other things established standards for the security and privacy of human health-related information.IncinerationA physically destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of burning completely to ashes.Internal DataUniversity Data intended for internal University business use only with access restricted to a specific workgroup, department, group of individuals, or affiliates with a legitimate need. See K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy for an expanded definition and examples.MediaMaterial on which data are or may be recorded, such as magnetic disks or tapes, solid state devices like USB flash drives, optical discs like CDs and DVDs, or paper-based products.Media sanitizationThe process of removing data from storage media such that there is reasonable assurance that the data may not be retrieved and reconstructed.Public DataUniversity Data explicitly or implicitly approved for distribution to the public without restriction. See K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy for an expanded definition and examples.PulverizationA physically destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of grinding to a powder or dust.PurgingA media sanitization process that removes all data and any remnant of the data so thoroughly that the effort required to recover the data, even with sophisticated tools in a laboratory setting (i.e., a \"laboratory attack\"), exceeds the value to the attacker. A common method of purging data is to overwrite it with random data in three or more passes.University DataAny data related to Kansas State University (\"University\") functions that are a) stored on University information technology systems, b) maintained by K-State faculty staff, or students, or c) related to institutional processes on or off campus. This applies to any format or media (in other words, it is not limited to electronic data).\n.070 Roles and Responsibilities\nThe local department is responsible for ensuring that University Data are properly removed or destroyed from media before it leaves the control of the department for reuse or disposal.\n.080 Implementation Procedures\nWhile the primary purpose of this policy is to protect non-public University Data (e.g., data classified either internal or confidential), it is often very difficult to separate these classifications from public or personal data on the media, or determine conclusively that remnants of non-public data are not recoverable. Therefore, it is often most expedient and cost effective to purge all University Data from the media before reuse or disposal rather than try to selectively sanitize the sensitive data.\nLikewise, it is often most cost effective to physically destroy the media rather than expend the effort to properly purge data. However, if physical destruction is contracted to a third party outside the University, all University Data must be purged from the media before giving it to the third party.\nSpecific instructions for different types of media and regulations follow:\nElectronic Storage Media (hard disk drives in computers, external hard drives, USB flash drives, magnetic tapes, etc.)\nIf purging is done by overwriting the data, the\xc2\xa0entire media/device\xc2\xa0must be overwritten with a minimum of three passes.Equipment that can store University Data, such as desktop and laptop computers or external hard drives, and is permanently leaving the control of the University should have all data storage devices removed before disposition. If the equipment leaving University control must retain the data storage devices, all University Data must be properly purged.The only acceptable methods for physically destroying a hard drive are shredding, pulverizing, disintegration, or incineration.Degaussing is an acceptable method of purging data from magnetic media. Be aware that this normally renders the media unusable.Paper-Based MediaAny paper-based or other hard copy media containing confidential University Data must be shredded with a cross-cut shredder before disposal or transferred to an authorized third party contracted by the University for secure disposition of documents. The maximum particle size for paper-based media containing confidential data should be 1x5 mm (1/32\"x1/5\"). Media containing internal data should likewise be shredded with a cross-cut shredder if disclosure of the information contained therein might adversely impact the institution, an affiliated organization, or an individual. The maximum particle size for media containing internal data is 2x15 mm (1/16\"x3/5\").Incineration by methods compliant with all relevant health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations is an acceptable method for disposal of paper-based media.Optical Media (e.g., CDs and DVDs)Optical media containing internal or confidential University Data must be physically destroyed before disposal. An appropriate method of physical destruction is shredding with a cross-cut shredder.Smartphones, Tablets, etc.\xc2\xa0Any University Data must be purged from mobile devices before reuse or disposal, like any other storage media. It is also advisable to purge all other data from the device before reuse or disposal to protect your personal information.Other Media TypesFor other media and additional guidelines, refer to NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision1: Guidelines for Media Sanitization, Appendix A, \xc2\xa0Minimum Sanitization Recommendations.Export controlsMedia containing University Data in equipment that will be reused outside the United States must comply with export laws and regulations according to K-State\'s Export Control Program.Electronic Protected Health InformationK-State units responsible for electronic protected health information covered by HIPAA must also have media sanitization and disposal policies and procedures in accordance with HIPAA Security Final Rules, Section 164.310,\xc2\xa0Physical Safeguards, part (d), (1) & (2).Federal Tax InformationK-State units handling Federal Tax Information must also have media sanitization and disposal policies and procedures in accordance with IRS Publication 1075: Tax Information Security Guidelines for Federal, State, and Local Agencies.More InformationFor more information about media sanitization and disposal, including suggested software tools for purging hard drives and other K-State-specific resources and procedures, see K-State\'s Media Sanitization and Disposal web site.\n.090 Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\nState of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Security Standards Policy 7230A, Data Protection Standard and Physical Security Standard (PDF)K-State Data Classification and Security PolicyNIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1: Guidelines for Media SanitizationK-State Export Controls ProgramK-State Property Inventory Policy\xc2\xa0HIPAA Final Security Rules, Section 164.310, Physical Safeguards, part (d), (1) & (2)IRS Publication 1075: Tax Information Security Guidelines for Federal, State, and Local Agencies\n.100 Questions/Waivers\nThe Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for this policy.

requirements for protecting university information and technology resources from physical and environmental threats in order to reduce the risk of loss, theft, damage, or unauthorized access to those resources, or interference with K-State operations.\n.020 Scope\nThis policy applies to all university colleges, departments, administrative units, and affiliated organizations that use university information technology resources to create, access, store or manage University Data to perform their business functions.\n.030 Effective Date\nThis policy became effective on March 31, 2009.\n.040 Policy\nAll University information and technology resources should have appropriate physical and environmental security controls applied commensurate with identified risks.\n.050 Definitions\nCore network facilitiesThe cabling, equipment, and network/telecommunications rooms associated with the high speed backbone of K-State\xe2\x80\x99s campus network that carries aggregated network traffic for all the buildings and external network connections (e.g., the KanREN, Internet, and Internet2 connections).\xc2\xa0Mobile storage devicesAny easily movable device that stores University data, including but not limited to laptop computers, smartphones, external hard drives, and USB flash drives.Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS)A device designed to provide power, without delay, during any period when the normal power supply is incapable of performing acceptably.University DataAny data related to Kansas State University (\"University\") functions that are a) stored on University information technology systems, b) maintained by K-State faculty staff, or students, or c) related to institutional processes on or off campus. This applies to any format or media (in other words, it is not limited to electronic data).\n.060 Roles and Responsibilities\nResponsibility for physical and environmental security of K-State information and technology resources is shared by the individuals using these systems, units that own them, and system administrators responsible for managing the systems.\n.070 Implementing Procedures\nPhysical SecurityNetwork wiring and equipment \xe2\x80\x93 Network wiring and equipment rooms and cabinets must be locked when unattended with access limited to authorized personnel (typically network support staff) and visitors escorted by said authorized personnel. Other network cabling and devices should likewise be physically secured where feasible. Core network facilities should have the date and time of entry and departure recorded.Office doors \xe2\x80\x93 All office doors should remain locked after hours or when offices are unattended for a prolonged period of time.Mobile storage devices \xe2\x80\x93 Mobile storage devices should be stored securely when unattended. Appropriate secure storage methods include a locking security cable attached directly to the device, storage in a locked cabinet or closet, storage in a locked private office, or the like. Encrypting data stored on mobile devices, such as whole disk encryption on laptop computers, likewise reduces the risk of a breach of University Data resulting from theft, loss, or unauthorized access. When traveling with mobile storage devices or using them in public places, appropriate security precautions should be taken to prevent loss, theft, damage, or unauthorized access. Use of tracking and recovery software on laptop computers is encouraged.Environmental SecurityElectrical power \xe2\x80\x93 Electrical power for servers hosting enterprise and departmental services must be protected by uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) to ensure continuity of services during power outages and to protect equipment from damage due to power irregularities. Each UPS should have sufficient capacity to provide at least 30 minutes of uptime to the systems connected to it. Systems hosting confidential data should also be protected with a standby power generator where feasible.\n.080 Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\nK-State Data Classification and Security PolicyK-State Network/Telecommunications Space Accommodations Policy - specifies physical security for network and telecommunications facilities.State of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Security Standards Policy 7230A (PDF)ISO/IEC 27002:2013: Information technology \xe2\x80\x93 Security techniques \xe2\x80\x93 Code of practice for information security management, published by the\xc2\xa0International Standards Organization.

25, 2009; Revised January 9, 2023\nTable of Contents\n.010 Purpose\n.020 Scope\n.030 Effective Date\n.050 Policy\n.060 Definitions\n.070 Roles and Responsibilities\n.090 Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\n.100 Questions/Waivers\n.010 Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to define requirements for system security planning and management to improve protection of University information system resources. Security has to be considered at all stages of the life cycle of an information system (i.e., feasibility, planning, development, implementation, maintenance, and retirement) in order to:\nensure conformance with all appropriate security requirementsprotect sensitive information throughout its life cyclefacilitate efficient implementation of security controlsprevent the introduction of new risks when the system is modifiedensure proper removal of data when the system is retired\nThis policy provides guidance to ensure that systems security is considered during the development and maintenance stages of an information system\'s life cycle.\n.020 Scope\nThis policy applies to all university colleges, departments, administrative units, and affiliated organizations that use university information technology resources to create, access, store or manage University Data to perform their business functions. The requirements apply to enterprise information systems or systems that require special attention to security due to the risk of harm resulting from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information therein.\n.030 Effective Date\nThis policy became effective on July 24, 2009.\n.050 Policy\nAppropriate security controls should be considered at all stages of an information system life cycle, including the development and maintenance stages.\nSystem security plans and documentation - System security plans and documentation must be prepared for all enterprise information systems or other systems under development that require special attention to security due to the risk of harm resulting from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information therein. Such plans should provide an overview of the security requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements through all stages of the system\'s life cycle. When the system is modified in a manner that affects security, system documentation must be updated accordingly.Separate development, testing, and production environments - System development, testing, and production should be performed in separate environments.Test data - Testing of enterprise information systems should be done with fabricated data that mimics the characteristics of the real data, or on copies of real data with any confidential data appropriately sanitized. Testing should not be done on live data due to the threat to its confidentiality and/or integrity. Testing that requires the use of live data or confidential data must have appropriate security controls employed.Vulnerability management\xc2\xa0 - An assessment of the system\'s security controls and a vulnerability assessment that seeks to identify weaknesses that may be exploited must be performed on all new enterprise information systems or ones undergoing significant change before moving them into production. Periodic vulnerability assessments must also be performed on production enterprise information systems and appropriate measures taken to address the risk associated with identified vulnerabilities. Vulnerability notifications from vendors and other appropriate sources should be monitored and assessed for all systems and applications associated with enterprise information system.Vendor acquisitions\xc2\xa0 - If an enterprise information system or component of that system is acquired from an external vendor, written documentation must be provided that specifies how the product meets the security requirements of this policy and any special security requirements of the system. The vendor must allow testing of the system\'s security controls by K-State or an independent third party, if needed.\n.060 Definitions\nConfidential dataHighly sensitive data intended for limited, specific use by a workgroup, department, or group of individuals with a legitimate need-to-know. See K-State\'s Data Classification and Security Policy for an expanded definition and examples.Enterprise information systemAn information system and/or server providing services commonly needed by the University community and typically provided by central IT units. Departmental information systems provide services specific to the mission and focus of individual Colleges, departments, administrative units, or affiliated organizations and are typically provided by distributed IT staff in those units.Live dataData accessible to users through systems that are in production (i.e., live).University DataAny data related to Kansas State University (\"University\") functions that are:\nstored on University information technology systemsmaintained by K-State faculty staff, or studentsrelated to institutional processes on or off campus\nThis applies to any format or media (in other words, it is not limited to electronic data).\n.070 Roles and Responsibilities\nChief Information Security Officer (CISO) - Coordinates the development of guidance for the development, review, and approval of system security plans as well as the identification, implementation, and assessment of common security controls; oversees periodic vulnerability assessments for enterprise information systems; and coordinates implementation of other assessments as needed with information system security administrators.Enterprise IT Security Analyst - Ensures the application of appropriate operational security controls for an information system; coordinates with the CISO in the identification, implementation, and assessment of common security controls; plays an active role in developing and updating a system security plan and coordinating with an information system owner any changes to the system and assessing the security impact of those changes. This role may be filled by someone directly involved with the development, maintenance, and/or operation of the information system.\n.090 Related Laws, Regulations, or Policies\nExisting K-State systems development and maintenance policies\nSecurity patches - K-State\'s requirements for keeping systems and applications is in\xc2\xa0K-State\'s Security for Information, Computing and Network Resources Policy, Section .050.J: Security Patches.Other related laws, regulations, or policies\nK-State\'s Data Classification and Security PolicyK-State\'s Computing and Information Technology Policy, Section .050\xc2\xa0State of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Policy 7230, Revision 1: General Information Technology Enterprise Security PolicyState of Kansas, ITEC Information Technology Security Standards Policy 7230A (PDF)ISO/IEC 27002:2013: Information technology - Security techniques - Code of practice for information security management, published by the International Security standards Organization.

January 9, 2023\nTable of Contents\n.010 Introduction\n.020 Policy\n.030 Related Kansas Law and Board of Regents Policy\n.040 Questions\n.010 Introduction\nThis Policy clarifies the applicability of law and certain other University policies to electronic mail. Users are reminded that all usage of K-State's information technology resources including electronic mail is subject to all University policies including K-State's Information Technology Usage Policy.\n.020 Policy\nThe University encourages the use of electronic mail and respects the privacy of users. Nonetheless, electronic mail and data stored on the University's network of computers may be accessed by the University for the following purposes:\nFor items A-G, the extent of the access will be limited to what is reasonably necessary to acquire the information and/or resolve the issue.\ntroubleshooting hardware and software problems,preventing unauthorized access and system misuse,retrieving University business related information, *investigating reports of alleged violation of University policy or local, state or federal law,*complying with legal requests (e.g.; court orders) for information, *rerouting or disposing of undeliverable mail,addressing safety or security issues.\n* The system administrator will need written approval, including email, indicating the extent of access that has been authorized from the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or the CIO's designee, to access specific mail and data for these purposes.\nTo the greatest extent possible in a public setting individuals' privacy should be preserved. However, there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality for documents and messages stored on University-owned equipment.\nUsers of electronic mail systems should be aware that, in addition to being subject to authorized access, electronic mail in its present form cannot be secured and is, therefore, vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification by third parties. Receivers of electronic mail documents should check with the purported sender if there is any doubt about the identity of the sender or the authenticity of the contents, as they would with print documents. Users of electronic mail services should be aware that even though the sender and recipient have discarded their copies of an electronic mail record, there may be back-up copies of such electronic mail that can be retrieved.\nUniversity electronic mail services may, subject to the foregoing, be used for incidental personal purposes provided such use does not interfere with University operation of information technologies including electronic mail services, burden the University with incremental costs, or interfere with the user's employment or other obligations to the University.\nRegistered student and campus organizations such as the College Republican Club or the Young Democrats may use their membership listservs to notify members of meetings, speeches, or rallies. Faculty members may use electronic systems for course-related discussions of political topics. Individuals may use email to exchange ideas and opinions, including those dealing with political issues. The latter is generally considered an incidental use of the email system. However, University information technology resources, including email, may not be used to support partisan political candidates or party fundraising. This statement is consistent with Kansas law and Board of Regents policy on political activity. (See Kansas law and Board of Regents policy printed at the end of this policy.)\nElectronic mail may constitute a public record like other documents subject to disclosure under the Kansas Open Records Act or other laws, or as a result of litigation. However, prior to such disclosure, the University evaluates all requests for information submitted by the public for compliance with the provisions of the Act or other applicable law. In addition, electronic mail may constitute University records subject to the University's Retention of Records Policy. As such, they may need to be retained for longer than an email system is capable of retaining them. It is the responsibility of the sender/recipient to determine if a particular email message constitutes a university record.\nIf an email message is a university record (as defined in PPM, Chapter 3090) it is subject to the same retention period as the paper equivalent. Email messages which require long-term retention should be either retained electronically on retrievable media or printed, including all header and transmission information, and filed with their electronic or paper equivalents by the sender/recipient. K-Staters should not consider back-up media on the central system as permanent archival storage (email back up media are only available for 30 days).\nIncidental personal electronic mail which is not subject to the Retention of Records Policy may be destroyed at the user's discretion.\nFaculty, unclassified professionals, and university support staff may not suppress publication of (e.g., unlist) their University eID in the online directory or other official publication of Kansas State University. Exceptions for special circumstances must be approved by the Chief Information Officer or official designee.\nEmail is considered a formal communication by the University with faculty, staff and students. Faculty, staff and students are expected to check their email on a frequent and consistent basis in order to stay current with University and/or faculty-student related communications. For more information regarding official correspondence see K-State's Official Electronic Correspondence with Faculty, Staff and Students Policy.\nViolations of University policies governing the use of University electronic mail services may result in restriction of access to University information technology resources in addition to any disciplinary action that may be applicable under other University policies, guidelines or implementing procedures, up to and including dismissal.\nIn January of each year the Chief Information Officer will report to the Faculty Senate regarding cases dealt with that year. For privacy purposes all names will be omitted.\n.030 Related Kansas Law and Board Of Regents Policy\nKansas Statutes Annotated (K.S.A.) 25-4169a. Use of public funds, vehicles, machinery, equipment and supplies and time of certain officers and employees to influence nomination or election of candidate prohibited; exceptions; distribution of political material in public buildings, limitations on; misdemeanor.\nNo officer or employee of the state of Kansas, or any municipality, shall use or authorize the use of public funds or public vehicles, machinery, equipment or supplies of any such governmental agency or the time of any officer or employee of any such governmental agency, for which the officer or employee is compensated by such governmental agency, to expressly advocate the nomination, election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate to state office or local office. The provisions of this section prohibiting the use of time of any officer or employee for such purposes shall not apply to an incumbent officer campaigning for nomination or reelection to a succeeding term to such office or to mem\xc2\xa0The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the use of internet connectivity provided by the state of Kansas or any municipality to any candidate or elected official. \xc2\xa0Except as otherwise provided in this section, no municipality shall permit or allow any person to distribute, or cause to be distributed, within any building or other structure owned, leased or rented by such municipality any brochure, flier, political fact sheet or other document which expressly advocates the nomination, election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for state or local office unless each candidate for such state or local office is permitted or allowed to do so in the same manner. \xc2\xa0For the purposes of this subsection, the term municipality shall have the meaning ascribed to it in K.S.A. 12-105a, and amendments thereto. \xc2\xa0Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor.\xc2\xa0Kansas Board of Regents Policy Manual (Chapter 2, section 13d): In the interest of the fullest participation in public affairs, personnel are free to express opinions speaking or writing as an individual in their personal capacity and not as a representative of the institution in signed advertisements, pamphlets and related material in support of or opposition to parties and causes. There shall be the commensurate responsibility of making plain that each person so doing is acting for himself or herself and not on behalf of an institution supported by tax funds drawn from citizens of varying political and economic views. This responsibility includes avoiding the use of university letterhead and stationery and other official university designations. Employees testifying before the Legislature on behalf of outside entities shall notify their institution\xe2\x80\x99s designated representative prior to such testimony.\n.040 Questions\nQuestions regarding this policy should be sent to the Vice President for Information Technology and\xc2\xa0Chief Information Officer (CIO).\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23\""];

is the policy of Kansas State University to provide and maintain safe conditions and to follow the operating practices that safeguard all employees, students and visitors. The purpose of the Fire and Life Safety Policy is to provide a safe environment for the University community through compliance with the State of Kansas Fire and Life Safety Codes as adopted by the Kansas State Fire Marshal\'s Office (KSFMO).\n.020 Goals\nThe goals of the policy are: to encourage safe practices and living habits throughout the University, thereby reducing the threat of injury to employees, students, and visitors; to reduce the risk to property; and to mitigate the effects in the event of a fire by reducing the incidence and degree of injuries and loss of property. To accomplish these goals, this policy defines the responsibility, means, methods and authority of individuals and University units that deal with Fire and Life Safety Code compliance issues internally and with the Kansas State Fire Marshal\'s Office.\n.030 Policy\nPersonnel of the University Fire Marshal\'s Office conduct inspections throughout the year with the goal to improve safety for building occupants and to reduce the number of violations that the KSFMO identifies. These personnel also encourage and assist in fire prevention, life safety education and training efforts, oversee the reviews of plans for all new structures and remodeling from the standpoint of fire protection, life safety and applicable code compliance, assist in the development of appropriate fire protection standards/guidelines, interpret applicable fire and life safety codes, regulations, and laws, and act in an advisory capacity on fire protection and life safety matters to the faculty, staff and students. Any faculty, staff, or student should report any situation that seems in violation of the Life Safety Code.\nThe KSFMO number one concern is protecting lives. In this endeavor, the policy encourages proper storage of combustible materials and maintaining safe egress paths. Violations of these concerns are explained in the written policy. The written policy also describes actions of the University Fire Marshal\'s Office. A complete copy of the document is available from the Division of Public Safety.\n.040 Enforcement Actions\nThe State Fire Marshal can impose fines on the University for repeat violations. A $1,000 penalty may be assessed or a \"cease and desist order\" will be issued if a violation is not corrected after a \"second notice\" letter.\n.050 Questions\nQuestions are to be directed to the Division of Public Safety, telephone number (785)532-5856.\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

General Rules on Open Carry and Concealed Carry on Campus\nOpen carry of firearms and possession of weapons other than concealed handguns shall be prohibited on campus, while concealed carry of handguns is permitted on campus, subject to the rules stated in this policy. All weapons are prohibited at all off-campus University sponsored or supervised activities, except that, as required by law, the University does not prohibit employees, who are legally qualified, from carrying a concealed handgun while engaged in the duties of their employment outside of KSU\'s place of business, including while in a means of conveyance.\nNothing in this policy shall be read to prohibit possession of weapons on campus as necessary for the conduct of Board-approved academic programs or University-approved activities or practices with the advance written approval of the Chief or Assistant Chief of the KSU Police Department, or by University police or security officers while acting within the scope of their employment.\nIt shall be a violation of Board and University policy to openly display any lawfully possessed concealed carry handgun while on campus, except as provided herein.\nThere are no University locations that have been designated as prohibiting concealed carry with permanent adequate security measures. The University may from time to time designate a specific location as temporarily prohibiting concealed carry and use temporary adequate security measures as defined and required by law. Appropriate notice will be given whenever this temporary designation is made, including notice to the Board and appropriate signage.\nIn addition, areas of buildings that have no public access entrances and are limited to restricted access entrances only may be off-limits to concealed carry, as determined by the University. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Restricted access entrance\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 means an entrance that is restricted to the public and requires a key, keycard, code, or similar device to allow entry to authorized personnel. \xe2\x80\x9cAuthorized personnel\xe2\x80\x9d means employees of the University and any person granted authorization pursuant to K.S.A. 75-7c20(d)(2), who are authorized to enter a University building through a restricted access entrance. Appropriate signage will be provided in these areas.\nii. Prohibitions Based on State Law\nBeginning July 1, 2017, any individual who is 21 years of age or older, and beginning July 1, 2021, any licensed individual who is 18-21 years of age, and who is lawfully eligible to carry a concealed handgun in Kansas shall not be precluded from doing so on campus except in University buildings and areas of buildings for which adequate security measures are provided, and except as otherwise prohibited by law.\nRegardless whether the individual is otherwise lawfully eligible to carry a concealed handgun, the following restrictions apply to the carrying of a firearm by Kansas law, and the violation of any of the following restrictions is a crime under Kansas law and a violation of this policy:\nAn individual in possession of a concealed firearm must be at least 21 years of age [K.S.A. 21-6302(a)(4)];A firearm cannot be carried by an individual under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, to such a degree as to render the individual incapable of safely operating the firearm [K.S.A. 21-6332];A firearm cannot be carried by an individual who is both addicted to and an unlawful user of a controlled substance [K.S.A. 21-6301(a)(10)];A firearm cannot be carried by an individual who is or has been a mentally ill person subject to involuntary commitment [K.S.A. 21-6301(a)(13)];A firearm cannot be carried by an individual with an alcohol or substance abuse problem subject to involuntary commitment [K.S.A. 21-6301(a)(13)];A firearm cannot be carried by an individual who has been convicted of a felony crime [K.S.A. 21-6304];An automatic firearm cannot be carried [K.S.A. 21-6301(a)(5)];A cartridge which can be fired by a handgun and which has a plastic-coated bullet with a core of less than 60% lead by weight is illegal [K.S.A. 21-6301(a)(6)];Suppressors and silencers cannot be used with a firearm [K.S.A. 21-6301(a)(4)]; and,Firearms cannot be fired in the corporate limits of a city or at a dwelling, or at a structure or vehicle in which people are present, except in self-defense [K.S.A. 21-6308, 6308a].\nIt shall also be a violation of this policy to otherwise possess, store, transport, trade, sell, or in any other way use a firearm in violation of any applicable law.\niii. Carrying and Storing Handguns\nEach individual who lawfully possesses a handgun on campus shall be wholly and solely responsible for carrying, storing and using that handgun in a safe manner and in accordance with the law, Board policy and University policy. Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to require individuals who lawfully possess a handgun to use it in defense of others.\nBeginning July 1, 2017, each individual who lawfully possesses a concealed handgun on campus shall at all times have that handgun in their custody and control, and shall either:\n1. carry it concealed on or about their person in a manner that complies with this policy, or;2. keep it stored in any secure storage location provided by the university specifically for that purpose, at their residence, or in their privately-owned or leased vehicle.\nIndividuals who carry a handgun on campus must carry it concealed on or about their person at all times. With respect to this policy, \xe2\x80\x9cconcealed\xe2\x80\x9d means completely hidden from view and does not reveal the weapon in any way, shape, or form. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout\xe2\x80\x9d the person means that an individual may carry a handgun if it can be carried securely in a suitable carrier, such as a backpack, purse, handbag, or other personal carrier designed and intended for the carrying of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s personal items. Moreover, the carrier must at all times remain within the exclusive and uninterrupted control of the individual. This includes wearing the carrier with one or more straps consistent with the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s design, carrying or holding the carrier, or setting the carrier next to or within the immediate reach of the individual. Except in those instances where necessary for self-defense or transferring to safe storage and except as otherwise provided in this Policy, it shall be a violation of Board and University policy to openly display any lawfully possessed concealed carry handgun while on campus.\nEvery handgun carried by an individual, whether on their person or in a carrier, must be secured in a holster that completely covers the trigger and the entire trigger guard area and that secures any external hammer in an un-cocked position. The handgun must be secured in the holster with a strap or by other means of retention. The holster must have sufficient tension or grip on the handgun to retain it in the holster even when subjected to unexpected jostling. Handguns with an external safety must be carried with the safety in the \xe2\x80\x9con\xe2\x80\x9d position. Semiautomatic handguns must be carried without a chambered round of ammunition. Revolvers must be carried with the hammer resting on an empty chamber.\nHandguns shall not be stored:\n1. in any University classroom, lab, office, or facility;2. in an on-campus residential unit, except in the residential unit of a licensed individual who is 18-21 years of age or any individual who is 21 years of age or older, who legally owns the handgun, and when the handgun is secured in an approved storage device;3. in any non-privately owned or leased motor vehicle; or,4. in any other location and under any circumstances except as specifically permitted by this policy and by state and federal law.\nHandguns may be stored:\n1. in an individual\xe2\x80\x99s privately-owned or leased motor vehicle when the vehicle is locked (if unattended) and the handgun is secured in a location within the vehicle that is not visible from outside the vehicle; or,2. in an individual\xe2\x80\x99s on-campus residential unit when the handgun is secured in a holster and in an approved storage device. Handgun storage by any other means than specifically permitted in this policy is prohibited.\nFor any on-campus residential unit that does not have adequate security measures, each resident who lawfully possesses a handgun on campus and elects to store the handgun they possess in the room to which they are assigned when not carrying it on their person in a concealed fashion shall secure the handgun in a secure storage device that conceals the gun from view. Such storage devices shall be provided by the individual who possesses the handgun and must meet minimum industry standards for safe-keeping of handguns.\nThe University does not provide approved handgun storage devices to any person under any circumstances. Each individual who stores a handgun in an on-campus residence must provide their own approved storage device. An approved storage device has each of these characteristics:\n1. it is of sufficient size to fully enclose the handgun while secured in an approved holster;2. it is constructed of sturdy materials that are non-flammable;3. it has a combination, digital, or other secure locking device that can only be unlocked by the individual using the storage device, but devices secured exclusively with a key lock are prohibited; and,4. the device is constructed specifically for the storage of a handgun and/or ammunition. All ammunition stored in an on-campus residence must be stored in an approved storage device.\n.040 Reporting and Temporary Actions\nAll reports of suspected violation of the concealed carry policy are made to the University Police Department by picking up any Emergency Campus Phone or by calling: 785-532-6412.\nUniversity Police will conduct an initial investigation to determine whether the report describes a criminal matter and/or a policy violation.\nUniversity Police have the authority to disarm and/or temporarily confiscate a firearm and issue a restriction to not carry a concealed firearm on campus pending results of the weapons policy violation determination. The decision whether to confiscate and issue a restriction prohibiting concealed carry will be made by University Police when there is probable cause to believe that a violation of this policy has occurred or continued possession and carrying by the alleged policy violator will create imminent danger to self or others. This authority does not supersede or alter the authority of University Police to confiscate a firearm during a criminal investigation. A confiscated firearm will be stored and handled by University Police according to their policies.\nThe Threat Management Team, the Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT), or the President may take any temporary action as determined necessary to ensure the safety of the University and of its students and personnel. Such temporary action may include, but is not necessarily limited to: prohibiting an alleged policy violator from carrying a concealed firearm anywhere within the geographic limits of this policy; if a student is the alleged policy violator, temporary suspension from one or more classes in which the student is enrolled, or a change in the student\xe2\x80\x99s class schedule, or the placement of restrictions or conditions on the student in order to continue with normal class attendance and participation; if an employee (faculty or staff) is the alleged policy violator, temporary administrative leave with or without pay, or the placement of restrictions or conditions on the employee in order to continue with the employee\xe2\x80\x99s normal employment.\n.050 Sanctions\nAny individual who violates one or more provisions of this policy may be issued a lawful directive to leave campus with the weapon immediately. Any individual who violates the directive shall be considered to be in trespass and may be cited accordingly. Any employee or student of the university who violates one or more provisions of this policy shall be subject to discipline in accordance with applicable University codes of conduct. Any individual who violates state or federal law may be detained, arrested or otherwise subjected to lawful processes appropriate to the circumstances.\n.060 Notice and Training\nNotice of this policy, the Board policy, and the concealed carry law are given in this policy and shall also be given by way of reference to this policy in the University Handbook, the student conduct code and each housing contract. To the extent adequate security measures are used to prohibit concealed carry into stadiums, arenas and other large venues that require tickets for admission, the tickets shall state that concealed carry will be prohibited at that event. Signs will be posted as appropriate.\nLocally or regionally available firearm safety instruction may be found by following this link: http://ag.ks.gov/docs/default-source/documents/certified-instructor-directory.pdf.\n.070  Related Statutes and Regulations\nK.S.A 75-7c01, et seq.\nKansas Board of Regents Policy on Weapons Possession\n.080\xc2\xa0 Questions\nQuestions regarding this policy are to be directed to the University Police Department at (785) 532-6412 or to the\xc2\xa0Vice President for University Operations and Chief Operating Officer at (785) 532-6226.\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

The existence of this plan does not signify a layoff is predicted.\xc2\xa0 A specific layoff notice will be issued in the event a layoff is announced.\xc2\xa0 A layoff action should be considered only after all other options have been exhausted.\n.020 Definition of a Layoff\nA layoff is a reduction in workforce usually necessitated by a shortage of work or funds, reinstatement of an employee from leave, the abolition of a position or unit, or other material change in duties or reorganization. A layoff can be designated university-wide, by organizational unit, geographic area, by full-time or less than full-time positions, or by a combination of any of the above as determined by the Vice President, Division of Human Resources (VPHR). Layoffs result in permanent loss of the positions held by laid-off employees.\n.030 Layoff Notification to Division of Human Resources\nAn organizational unit facing layoff issues should immediately contact the VPHR, followed by a letter outlining the employee or employees to be laid off, the reason for the layoff, and the date requested for the layoff.\n.040 Organizational Units\nLayoffs can be designated by organizational unit. Major organizational areas are identified below.\nOffice of the PresidentOffice of the ProvostOffice of the Vice President for University Operations and Chief Operating OfficerOffice of the Chief Financial Officer and Director of Budget PlanningOffice of the Vice President for Student LifeOffice of the Vice President for Communications and MarketingOffice of the Chief Diversity OfficerOffice of the Vice President for Human ResourcesKansas State SalinaKansas State OlatheGlobal CampusLibrariesGraduate SchoolCollege of Arts and SciencesCollege of Business AdministrationCollege of EducationCollege of Architecture, Planning and DesignCollege of EngineeringCollege of Health and Human SciencesCollege of Veterinary MedicineCollege of Agriculture (includes Agriculture Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service)\n.050 Geographic Areas\nLayoffs can be designated statewide or by county. Kansas State University has offices and branches in all 105 counties in Kansas where layoffs could occur.\n.060 Bumping Rights - Options for Employees\nThe right of one employee to \"bump\" another employee from a job is dependent upon several factors, starting with a layoff score as described in the following section titled \"Layoff Scores.\" Additional criteria also apply.\nBumping will occur within the layoff group identified in the layoff notice or universitywide if no group is identified. A permanent employee or an employee considered permanent only for layoff purposes (such as an employee recently promoted to a new position and classification but who holds permanent status in another classification) who is affected by a layoff may bump into another position under certain conditions, including that the employee is considered to be a sound match of employee abilities to essential job functions. USS limited-term employees do not have bumping rights.\nFor an employee to be bumped, the employee must: 1) have a lower layoff score than the employee exercising the bumping right; 2) not be scheduled for layoff, and 3) have the lowest layoff score for anyone in that class not scheduled for layoff.\nClass series: A class series is two or more job classifications having similar job content but different levels of skills, responsibility, difficulty and qualifications.\nBumping is exercised as follows:\nThe employee may bump into a lower classification in a class series OR\xc2\xa0The employee may bump into a lower classification in which the employee previously had permanent status OR\xc2\xa0The employee may bump into a position anywhere in the university filled by a probationary employee if:a) the permanent employee scheduled to be laid off is interested in the position;b) the permanent employee scheduled to be laid off meets the required competencies and minimum qualifications of the position and had prior permanent status in the position; andc) when the layoff is limited to full-time or less than full-time employees, permanent employees may bump into positions filled by probationary employees having the same full-time or less than full-time status.\nNew hires and rehires on probationary appointments will not be granted permanent status on or after the date the VPHR has issued a layoff notice. However, any new hire or rehire on probation in a position for which no employee subject to layoff meets the required selection criteria may be given permanent status. New hires and rehires on probation shall have their probationary period extended until it is certain that no permanent employee whose position is to be vacated by a layoff or who otherwise would be laid off through the exercise of bumping rights is claiming the probationary position.\n.070 Layoff Scores\nLayoff scores are used to determine the order in which employees are laid off. The employee with the lowest layoff score in the particular category identified in the layoff notice will be the first person to be laid off. Layoff scores will be calculated for every employee potentially affected by the layoff based on the class, classes or class series identified in the Layoff Notice.\nLayoff scores are calculated using the number of years\' service multiplied by a point value derived from averaging the five most recent employee evaluations. An employee evaluation rating of Meets Expectation or higher will be worth 2 points and a rating of less than Meets Expectations will be worth 0 points. Where no evaluations were given, the employee evaluation rating will be considered as Meets Expectations. Special evaluations given for a rating period ending within 90 days of a layoff notice will not be considered. The VPHR will designate the cutoff date for performance evaluations.\nEvery employee for whom a layoff score has been calculated will have the right to review the manner in which the score was obtained.\n.080 Layoff Notice to Employee\nWritten notice will be provided to each employee in a position identified for layoff, to each employee who might be affected by the layoff and to each employee who may be laid off through the exercise of bumping rights. This notice will be given at least 45 days before the effective date of the proposed layoff. The letter will include the intent to layoff, the proposed effective date, the reason for the layoff, the employee\'s layoff score and right to review and general rights for reemployment. The letter will be hand delivered or delivered by certified mail-restricted delivery.\n.090 Layoff Conferences\nA representative of the Division of Human Resources will schedule and conduct individual conferences for each employee affected by a layoff. These conferences will begin as soon as possible after employees have received the notice of layoff. Conferences will be scheduled for employees starting with those with the highest layoff scores. Each employee will be informed of the options available, including bumping rights, transfer, placement assistance, and demotions.\n.100 Reemployment Rights\nEach employee who is laid off, demoted or transferred in lieu of layoff, will be placed in a reemployment pool unless the employee requests in writing not to be placed in the pool. Each employee in the reemployment pool shall be eligible to apply for any vacancy to be filled, including an internal vacancy, until the employee is re-employed or for three years from the date of the layoff, whichever occurs first. Persons in the reemployment pool are guaranteed an interview for positions for which they apply and meet the minimum qualifications.\n.110 Questions\nHuman Resources (HR) is responsible for this policy. The Vice President or designee must approve any exception to this policy or related procedures. Questions should be directed to Human Resources at 785-532-6277 or hr@ksu.edu.\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

Dissemination\n.090 Questions\n.010 Introduction\nConflicts of interest and time commitment are endemic to the modern university. These conflicts are a consequence of the many and varied roles that university members play in such areas as technology transfer and applied research, the creation of new multimedia teaching tools, and activities as expert consultants to local, state, and national governments as well as to the business community. The goal of this policy is to manage perceived, potential, and actual conflicts of interest and time commitment. A system of self- disclosure is most effective for Kansas State University, since conflicts of interest and time commitment must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Discussion, disclosure, and negotiation generally can resolve disputes related to conflicts of interest and time commitment.\nThis statement of policy concerning conflicts of interest and time commitment has been developed by a university task force in order to ensure compliance with the laws of the State of Kansas and mandates from the Kansas Board of Regents (KBOR) and federal funding agencies, the latter as a prerequisite for their future support. This policy applies only to personnel involved in research funded through the Public Health Service (PHS) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and is intended to, in large part, mirror the Conflict of Interest Policy currently located at Appendix S of the University Handbook that applies more broadly to University personnel. The difference is that this policy additionally includes the requirements mandated by federal regulations, and its provisions shall be interpreted to promote such purposes. PHS-Supported means any person who works in a laboratory or program supported by PHS funds through contract, grant or other cooperative agreement.\n.020 General Principles\nThis policy is based, in part, on the Board of Regents\' policy entitled Commitment of Time, Conflict of Interest, Consulting and Other Employment (pdf) (Chapter II, Section C.12, as Revised 6/20/2018).\nConflict of Time Commitment.Attempts to balance university responsibilities outlined in the preamble with external activities, such as, but not limited to, consulting, public service or pro bono work, can result in real or apparent conflicts regarding commitment of time and effort. Whenever a faculty or staff member\'s external activities exceed reasonable time limits, or whenever an unclassified staff or faculty member\'s primary professional responsibility is not to the University, a conflict of time commitment exists.Conflicts of commitment usually involve issues of time allocation. Faculty members and unclassified staff of state universities owe their primary professional responsibility to their employing University, and their primary commitment of time and intellectual effort must be to the education, service, research and scholarship missions of that University. Faculty and unclassified staff should maintain a presence on campus commensurate with their appointments. The specific responsibilities, position requirements, employment obligations and professional activities that constitute an appropriate and primary commitment of time will differ across schools and departments, but said responsibilities, requirements, obligations and activities should be initially premised on a general understanding of full-time commitment for full-time faculty or unclassified staff of the University. Exceptions must be justified and shown to enhance the institutional mission.Conflicts of Interest.A conflict of interest occurs when there is a divergence between an individual\'s private, personal relationships or interests and his/her professional obligations to the university or to the objectivity of research, such that an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual\'s professional actions or decisions are determined or substantially influenced by considerations of personal benefit, gain or advantage.In addition, and without limiting the foregoing definition of conflicts of interest, conflicts of interest related to research that are in whole or part funded by a PHS-funded grant, cooperative agreement or contract, are referred to in this policy as Financial Conflicts of Interest (\"FCOI\" or \"FCOIs\"). FCOIs are types of \"conflicts of interest\" referenced in this policy and are distinguished from the more general conflicts of interest only where necessary based on applicable regulations. FCOIs exist where an Investigator\'s significant financial interest (\"SFI\") could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of PHS-funded research.\n\"Investigators\" are project directors, principal investigators, and any other person, regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of PHS-funded research, which includes without limitation, collaborators and consultants.An SFI, as related to FCOIs, is a financial interest that reasonably appears to be related to an Investigator\'s \"institutional responsibilities\" in the following manners:\nThe value of remuneration (salary and any other payment for services) received by the Investigator, Investigator\'s spouse, and/or dependent children in the 12 months preceding a disclosure (see .040) from a publicly traded entity, plus the value of any equity interest held by such persons in the entity (stock, stock option or other ownership interest as determined by public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value) as of the date of the disclosure, exceeds $5,000;\xc2\xa0The value of remuneration received by an Investigator, Investigator\'s spouse, and/or dependent children from any non-publicly traded entity in the 12 months preceding the disclosure exceeds $5,000, OR when the Investigator, Investigator\'s spouse, and/or dependent children hold(s) any equity interest; orUpon receipt of income related to intellectual property rights and interests (such as patents and copyrights); provided however, this shall not include intellectual property rights assigned to Kansas State University and agreements to share in royalties related to such assigned rights.Reimbursed or sponsored travel related to institutional responsibilities, as further detailed in .040(3), about which the university shall make a determination of whether such travel constitutes an SFI.Significant financial interests, or SFIs, as used in this policy, may also exist, even though not pertaining to PHS-funded research, when a faculty or unclassified staff member holds greater than $10,000 or more than 5% ownership in a company, in accordance with the BOR\'s policy.An Investigator\'s \"institutional responsibilities\" include his or her professional responsibilities on behalf of Kansas State University, including without limitation, research, research consultation, teaching, directed and non-directed service, professional practice, institutional committee memberships, service on panels such as institutional review boards or data and safety monitoring boards, and other administrative/programmatic service committees or panels.Whether a conflict of interest or the appearance of one exists depends on the situation and foregoing guidelines and definitions, not on the character or actions of the individual, and must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The appearance of a conflict of interest can be as damaging or detrimental as an actual conflict and thus, for purposes of this policy, perceived and potential conflicts are treated the same as actual conflicts. Whether or not a conflict of interest exists is determined according to the process set forth at .040 and .050.Situations involving potential conflicts of interest are not uncommon in a modern university and must be addressed. State universities have as part of their mission the promotion of the public good by fostering the transfer of knowledge gained through university research and scholarship to the private sector. Two important means of accomplishing this institutional mission include consulting and the commercialization of technologies derived from research. It is generally appropriate that university personnel be rewarded for participating in these activities through consulting fees and sharing in royalties resulting from the commercialization of their work, but such is subject to the mandates of the aforementioned federal regulations. It is not appropriate, however, for an individual\'s actions or decisions made in the course of his or her university activities and/or in PHS-funded research to be determined or substantially influenced by considerations of personal financial gain and/or SFIs. Such behavior calls into question the professional objectivity of the decisions and research, as well as the ethics of the individual. It also reflects negatively on the employing university. State universities are institutions of public trust; faculty and unclassified staff, as well as any other Investigator, must respect that status and conduct their affairs in ways that will not compromise the integrity of the university or the objectivity of PHS-funded research.Except in purely incidental ways, University resources, including but not limited to facilities, materials, personnel, or equipment, may not be used in external activities unless prior written approval has been received from the University\'s chief executive officer or his/her designee. Such permission shall be granted only when the use of University resources is determined to further the mission of the University. When such permission is granted, the faculty member or unclassified staff member will make arrangements for reimbursement of the University for institutional materials, facilities or services used in the external activity. Such use may never be authorized if it violates the Board of Regents policy on Sales of Products and Services.Proprietary or other information confidential to the University may never be used in external activities unless prior written approval has been received from the University\'s chief executive officer or designee.Faculty or unclassified staff may not involve University students, classified staff, unclassified staff or faculty in their external activities if such involvement is in any way coerced or in any way conflicts with the involved participants\' required commitment of time to their University. For example, a student\'s grades or progress towards a degree may not be conditioned on participation in a University employee\'s external activities.At Kansas State University a college or unit may, in consultation with the provost, add clarification to the above definitions of actual, perceived, and potential conflicts relating to other actions leading to conflicts of interest or time commitment that are unique to the unit\'s professional mission; provided however, any such clarification shall be in accordance with the regulations pertaining to FCOIs, if applicable. The final determination of such clarification shall be by the provost or an official designated by the provost.The University\'s nepotism policy is stated in PPM chapter 4095.\n.030\xc2\xa0Consulting and Other Employment\nThe Consulting Request form (pdf) must be filed with and approved by the same process set forth in .050 in advance of undertaking any consulting activity.\nConsulting for Other State of Kansas Agencies. Consulting by faculty members and employees of institutions under the jurisdiction of the Board for another institution under the jurisdiction of the Board, as well as consultation for other state agencies, shall be approved in advance by both (a) the institution or agency seeking these services, and (b) approved by the employee\'s home institution. The home institution shall effect payment through the regular process and shall receive reimbursement through the interfund transfer process. (12-16-77; 11-19-82; 5-1 7-85)Consulting Outside the University. For members of the faculty and unclassified professionals, the state university permits, and indeed encourages, a limited amount of personal, professional activity outside the faculty member\'s or unclassified professional\'s reasonable construed total professional responsibilities of employment by and for the University, provided such activity: (a) further develops the faculty member or unclassified professional in a professional sense or serves the community, state, or nation in a professional capacity; (b) does not interfere with the faculty member\'s or unclassified professional\'s teaching, research and service to the university; (c) is consistent with the objectives of the University; and (d) any such consulting or remuneration therefor is not a conflict of interest that cannot be satisfactorily managed. Regular instructional service to other educational institutions is normally regarded as an inappropriate personal, professional activity and is thus generally prohibited. Without prior written approval, faculty members or unclassified professionals on full-time appointments must not have significant outside managerial responsibilities nor act as principal investigators on sponsored projects that could be conducted at their employing university but instead are submitted and managed through another organization.Other Employment. The Board of Regents expects faculty and unclassified staff employed by the state universities to give full professional effort to their assignments. It is, therefore, considered inappropriate to engage in gainful employment outside the state university that is incompatible with institutional commitments. It is inappropriate to transact business for personal gain unrelated to the University from one\'s University office, or at times when it might interfere with commitments to the University. Uncompensated participation in academic conferences, workshops and seminars on matters relating to education or the other functions of the University does not usually constitute consulting or outside employment. However, organizing and operating such meeting for profit may be construed as consulting or outside employment as defined in this policy..\n.040 Reporting and Disclosure Requirements; Training; Duties of Investigators; Records\nAnnual Reporting.\nAll faculty and unclassified staff with 100% appointments as part of the initial appointment process, all faculty and unclassified staff, who hold fractional appointments on an annual basis, and any other personnel who may qualify as an Investigator pursuant to the definition at .020(2)(b)(1) on an annual basis, must disclose to the University, at the applicable specified times, whether they or members of their immediate family (spouse and dependent children), personal household, or associate entities (e.g., corporations, partnerships or trusts) have any SFI and/or conflict of interest, as defined at .020(2). Such disclosures are to be made on the annual Declaration for Conflict of Interest and Time Commitment Form (available on HRIS) and the PHS Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) Declaration (pdf).\nThe annual Declaration for Conflict of Interest and Time Commitment form (Declaration), which can be accessed through HRIS Employee Self-Service (Path: Employee Self Service > Personal Information > Conflict of Interest) must be filed annually. These will continue to be filled out and signed electronically. Additional forms have also been developed to implement this policy as it pertains to federal regulations, which are currently available to be filled out in hard copy: these include the annual\xc2\xa0PHS Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) Declaration (pdf) (PHS Declaration), and if necessary, the PHS Supplemental Disclosure (pdf) statement (Supplemental Disclosure), the PHS FCOI Management Plan (pdf) (PHS Management Plan), and the Sponsored & Reimbursed Travel Form (pdf) (defined below). The PHS FCOI Declaration and related documents must be filed by each Investigator who is planning to participate in PHS-funded research (and those of the investigator\xe2\x80\x99s spouse and dependent children) no later than at the time of application for PHS-funded research, and at least annually.\nIf the faculty or unclassified staff member, or other Investigator, answers yes on any question on the Declaration or PHS Declaration, he or she shall submit along with the Declaration or PHS Declaration a completed \xe2\x80\x9cDisclosure Statement of Significant Financial and/or Time Commitment Interests\xe2\x80\x9d (Disclosure), or \xe2\x80\x9cSupplemental Disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d with the applicable Declaration form. If the faculty or unclassified staff member, or other Investigator, believes there to be a perceived, potential or actual conflict of interest, he or she shall also submit along with the above documents either the Conflict of Interest/Time Commitment Management Plan (accessed through HRIS) or the PHS Management Plan (pdf). Additionally, when the University, through the review process in .050, determines that the information submitted indicates that a perceived, potential or actual conflict of time commitment or conflict of interest does or may exist, the University may require that the faculty or unclassified staff member, or other Investigator, submit additional information and explanation regarding such conflict, including without limitation, an additional Declaration, Supplemental Declaration, Disclosure, Supplemental Disclosure, and/or a Management Plan.\nOngoing Duty to Report SFIs and Conflicts As They Occur. In addition to the initial and annual report that must be filed, such individuals must also disclose to the direct supervisor, department head/chair or dean on an ad hoc basis any current or prospective situations that may raise questions or conflict of time commitment, conflict of interest, or SFI, including without limitation new conflicts of interest or SFIs and updated information from a previously disclosed conflict of interest or SFI, as soon as such situations become known, and in any instance, not later than thirty (30) days after discovery or acquisition of the SFI. To make such a disclosure, a new Declaration and/or PHS Declaration, as applicable, shall be filled out and submitted to the direct supervisor and through the review process at .050.\xc2\xa0Sponsored and Reimbursed Travel. Investigators must report travel reimbursements and sponsored travel relating to their institutional responsibilities that are directly reimbursed to them or where travel costs are paid on behalf of the employee by another party other than those exempted entities expressly excluded in this paragraph. \xc2\xa0Reports must include purpose of the trip, sponsor/organizer, destination, and trip duration, and shall be submitted within 30 days of travel. Provided however, travel that is reimbursed or sponsored by a federal, state, or local government agency, an institution of higher education, an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute does not have to be reported. Such disclosures shall be made on the Sponsored & Reimbursed Travel Form (pdf) (Sponsored Travel Form).After disclosure of information, the form shall be submitted to the immediate supervisor and the review process at .050 shall be followed to determine if there is an SFI and if so, a conflict of interest based on such reimbursed or sponsored travel.Federal Reporting Requirements. State universities are required to adhere to and implement any additional policies and procedures and disclosure requirements that are imposed by applicable federal conflict of interest laws. As set forth above, policies pertaining to federal PHS-funded research conflicts of interest are included within this policy. The University has composed additional form(s) regarding conflicts of interest to comply with federal regulations without approval of the Council of Presidents, as permitted by BOR policy. These are in addition to the information required on the form(s) developed by the Council of Presidents.Reporting of Consulting. Aside from the exception specified below, the faculty member or unclassified professional must report the proposed arrangements for personal professional activities on the Consulting Request Form and secure written or electronic approval prior to engaging in the activities. For all activities concerned, the report should indicate the extent and nature of the activities, the amount of time to be spent in the activities, and the total amount of time spent or expected to be spent on all such outside activities during the current academic year. To the extent applicable, if the consulting presents an SFI or conflict of interest, such SFI and conflict shall also be disclosed on the applicable Declaration and Disclosure form(s).The faculty member or unclassified professional staff must inform the provost, through the direct supervisor, department chair or head and the dean, of all external personal, professional activities. For faculty members only, personal, professional activities that occur within a single 24-hour period need not have prior approval but must be reported annually in writing on the electronic annual Declaration for Conflict of Interest and Time Commitment on HRIS (path: Employee Self Service > Personal Information > Conflict of Interest).Unclassified professionals must inform the appropriate vice president or the provost, through the unit head and appropriate supervising administrator, of all external personal professional activities. Unclassified professionals must obtain written approval prior to engagement in all external personal professional activity regardless of the length of engagement.Disposition of Reports; Maintenance of Records. All required documentation and reports shall be submitted in accordance with institutional requirements and shall be included in individual personnel files to be used for the determination of whether an individual is in compliance with this policy. Such documents and reports will also be available to institutional research officers to permit certification and/or verification of compliance with federal regulations. The University must maintain these records and reports for a minimum of three years. Regarding PHS-funding through grants or cooperative agreements, the University shall maintain records, through the \xe2\x80\x9cOffice\xe2\x80\x9d, as defined below, relating to all Investigator disclosures of financial interests and the University\xe2\x80\x99s review of, and response to, such disclosures (whether or not a disclosure resulted in the Institution\'s determination of a financial conflict of interest) and all actions under the Institution\'s policy or retrospective review, if applicable, for at least three years from the date the final expenditures report is submitted to the PHS or, where applicable, from other dates specified in federal regulations for different situations. Regarding PHS-funding through contracts, the \xe2\x80\x9cOffice\xe2\x80\x9d shall maintain records relating to all Investigator disclosures of financial interests and the University\xe2\x80\x99s review of, and response to, such disclosures (whether or not a disclosure resulted in the University\xe2\x80\x99s determination of a FCOI), and all actions under the University\xe2\x80\x99s policy or retrospective review, if applicable, for at least three years from the date of final payment or, as specified in the applicable federal regulations.Training. Each Investigator shall complete training regarding SFIs and FCOIs prior to engaging in research related to PHS-funded research and at least every four years, and immediately when any of the following circumstances apply:\nThe University revises any policy pertaining to FCOIs or procedures that affect the requirements of Investigators;An Investigator is new to the University; orWhen a University finds that an Investigator is not in compliance with the FCOI policies or a management plan pertaining to a FCOI.The Associate Vice President for Research Compliance is responsible for the training and any questions about the training, the requirements, or the frequency shall be\xc2\xa0directed to him or her. The training can be accessed at Financial Conflict of Interest Training webpage.\xc2\xa0As part of such training and as part of the PHS FCOI Declaration, each person shall certify receipt of the federal regulations found at 42 CFR Part 50, and 45 CFR Part 94.\n.050 Kansas State University Review Process\nUpon submission of any Declaration or PHS FCOI Declaration, or other related information or disclosures, or any updates related to any of the foregoing (see .040\xc2\xa0(1)-(2), above), a review process shall take place as follows:\nResponsibilities of Direct Supervisors and Unit Heads.First, the direct supervisor and then unit head will review the Declaration, PHS FCOI Declaration, PHS Supplemental Disclosure, Consulting Request, and/or the Sponsored & Reimbursed Travel Form and any information submitted pursuant to the ongoing duty to report. Any information submitted pursuant to the ongoing duty to report, shall be reviewed as set forth herein, and forwarded in a timely manner such that the provost can make a final determination within 60 days of the disclosure.The direct supervisor and unit head will review any SFI and other information, and indicate by an approval signature (either electronically or by hard copy, as applicable) when a report or request does not appear to indicate a possible conflict of interest or where a satisfactory management plan has been developed at the unit level. The reports or requests and any management plans that have been developed shall be forwarded to the dean or appropriate administrator.Guidelines to determine whether an SFI is related to PHS-funded research include a reasonable determination by the supervisor or unit head, as applicable, that the SFI: (i) could be affected by the PHS- funded research; or (ii) is an entity whose financial interest could be affected by the research. A determination as to whether there is a FCOI shall be made based on a reasonable determination that the SFI could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research. The direct supervisor and unit head may involve the Investigator in his or her determinations.In cases where the direct supervisor or unit head determines that there may be a possible conflict of interest or time commitment, the direct supervisor or unit head may require that the individual submit additional information and explanation regarding that conflict and participate in the development of a management plan, or in the absence of the ability for the conflict to be managed, the elimination of such conflict.If the management of a conflict of interest is unresolved at the unit head level, the following procedures will be followed: (i) the unit head will prepare a written summary of the case, with the faculty or unclassified staff member affected having the opportunity to review and discuss the summary with the unit head and having the opportunity to submit to the unit head a written response recording his or her perception of the case; (ii) before the unit head submits the summary to the next administrative level, the faculty or unclassified staff member must sign a statement acknowledging the opportunity to review and to discuss the summary and indicating whether he or she submitted a written response; (iii) the unit head who prepared the summary must submit to the dean or appropriate administrator all forms, the summary of the case, including the facts indicating a possible conflict of interest or time commitment, and any written responses prepared by the faculty or unclassified staff member.In the event that there is a conflict of interest for which a management plan is approved, the immediate supervisor shall regularly monitor compliance with such plan, until the completion of the PHS- funded research project if applicable, and report to the unit head any failures to comply, who shall report any such issues through the same review procedure and order of administrators as in this section. Failures to comply with the conflict management plan will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with .070 below.Responsibilities of Deans/Comparable Administrators.The dean will review all of the materials submitted to ensure that the correct procedures have been followed. The dean will then determine whether the case involves an SFI, conflict of interest or the appearance of one, and whether any conflict management plan which has been developed is acceptable. The dean will take into consideration, as applicable, the guidelines set forth at .050(1)(c) if applicable, or such other information that the dean deems appropriate in determining whether there is a conflict of interest. In cases where there is no such conflict or where the conflict management plan is acceptable, the dean will show approval by signing the PHS FCOI Declaration and the PHS Supplemental Disclosure in question.The dean will make recommendations for managing any perceived, potential or actual conflict that has not been resolved at the unit level, all in a manner acceptable to the dean. The dean may require that the individual submit additional information and explanation regarding that conflict and participate in the development of a management plan, or in the absence of the ability for the conflict to be managed, the elimination of such conflict. The recommendations will be presented to the unit head and the faculty, unclassified staff member or other Investigator. Those individuals must indicate in writing their acceptance of the dean\'s recommendation or their rejection of the recommendation. A written rejection must include the reasons why the individuals find the recommendation unacceptable.\xc2\xa0The dean must forward to the provost the form(s) and associated documentation (plans of management, recommended plans of management, and written statements of agreement or unresolved differences).Responsibilities of the Provost.The provost\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Academic Personnel (\xe2\x80\x9cOffice\xe2\x80\x9d) will review all the reports or requests and supporting materials and recommendations. The Office will assess whether any SFIs, conflicts or apparent conflicts of interest or time commitment exist. The Office will take into consideration the guidelines set forth at .050(1)(c), if applicable, and/or such other information that the Office deems appropriate in determining whether there is a conflict of interest. The Office and/or the Committee, as applicable, will evaluate the information, take into consideration, as applicable, the guidelines set forth at .050(1)(c), whether an SFI exists, whether the SFI constitutes a FCOI or other conflict of interest or time commitment, whether management plans which have been developed adequately manage any conflicts of interest and time commitment, and whether there are any inequities in the recommendations for management of conflicts. The Office and/or Committee, as applicable, will make a recommendation to the provost regarding any SFI or conflict.If the provost agrees with the recommendation, then after considering, as applicable, the guidelines set forth at .050(1)(c), such other information that the provost deems appropriate in determining whether there is a conflict of interest or of time commitment, the provost may approve the recommendation by signing the applicable form(s). If the provost does not agree with recommendations for conflict management or elimination made by subordinate administrators, including without limitation the Committee, an attempt must be made to reach consensus through consultation. If this fails, the provost\'s recommendation will be used. The provost may require that the individual submit additional information and explanation regarding that conflict and participate in the development of a management plan, or in the absence of the ability for the conflict to be managed, the elimination of such conflict. The individual(s) affected by the disagreement must be notified by the provost, in writing, of the provost\'s decision and its rationale.If the provost determines that there is a conflict of interest that can be satisfactorily managed, a management plan must be developed and implemented and if not already submitted, then submitted through the review process in this section .050. Additionally, an FCOI that is not eliminated but is managed pursuant to a management plan must be reported to the PHS Awarding Component through an FCOI report including the applicable federal regulation requirements.If, as set forth in this .050, there is determined to be an SFI or FCOI, a record shall be retained by the Office, for three years from the date the information was last updated, and be available and provided within five (5) business days of a request, as mandated under federal regulations. The Office shall provide the most updated information concerning such FCOI disclosed to the University that meets the following criteria: (i) the SFI was disclosed and is still held by the senior/key personnel; (ii) the University determines that the SFI is related to PHS-funded research; and (iii) the University determines that the SFI is an FCOI.In accordance with federal regulations, the University, through the Assistant Vice President for Research, must certify in each application for funding the requirements set forth in those applicable federal regulation(s). Prior to the expenditure of any PHS funds, the University shall submit an FCOI report regarding any Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s SFI found by the University to be conflicting and ensure that an adequate management plan has been implemented; if the conflict of interest is eliminated, rather than managed, no such report is required to be made. Within sixty (60) days of identification of a FCOI after the initial FCOI report, either due to a new Investigator, or a new or newly identified FCOI for existing Investigators, the University, through the provost\xe2\x80\x99s designee shall provide the PHS Awarding Component an FCOI report regarding the FCOI and ensure that a management plan has been implemented; when applicable, this shall be in addition to any reviews and mitigation reports related to noncompliance, as set forth below. The University shall also provide to the PHS Awarding Component an annual FCOI report that addresses the status of a previously reported FCOI and any changes to the management plan for the duration of the research project, as required by federal regulation. All FCOI reports shall be compliant with and include federal regulation requirements. The provost\xe2\x80\x99s designee is responsible for sending initial, annual, and revised FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component.Nondisclosure; Noncompliance.Within 60 days of a determination by any of the above-listed University officials of nondisclosure by an Investigator, failure by the University to review or manage a FCOI, or failure of an Investigator to comply with a management plan, all as pertaining to an FCOI, the direct supervisor and the unit head shall be notified and the review process in .050(1)-(3) initiated. This review process should be expedited by all University officials and immediately forwarded through the review process.If after the above-referenced review, the provost determines there is a FCOI, the University shall complete a retrospective review, within 120 days of the determination of nondisclosure, pursuant to the same order of review set forth in this .050, to (i) determine whether any PHS-funded research conducted during the period of noncompliance, was biased in the design, conduct or reporting of such research, (ii) implement any management plan as necessary, and (iii) document such review. The documentation shall include, as applicable, the following details: (i) project/contract number; (2) project title; (3) the principal Investigator or the contact Investigator if more than one; (4) name of the Investigator associated with the FCOI; (5) name of the entity with which the Investigator has a FCOI; (6) reason for the retrospective review; (7) detailed methodology used for retrospective review (e.g., methodology of review process, composition of the review panel, documents reviewed); (8) findings of the review; and (9) conclusions of the review.Based on the results of the retrospective review, the University, through the provost\xe2\x80\x99s designee, shall update a previously submitted FCOI report and specify actions being taken to manage the FCOI.If bias is found, the University, through the provost\xe2\x80\x99s designee, shall notify the PHS Awarding Component promptly and submit a mitigation report to it. The mitigation report must include: (i) the key elements documented in the retrospective review, (ii) a description of the bias on the research project, (iii) the University\xe2\x80\x99s plan of action taken to eliminate or mitigate the effect of bias, (iv) extent of harm done including any qualitative and quantitative data to support any actual or future harm, and (v) analysis of whether the research project is salvageable.Depending on the nature of the FCOI, the University, through the provost\xe2\x80\x99s designee, may determine that additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the PHS-funded research project between the determination of noncompliance and the completion of the retrospective review. The provost\xe2\x80\x99s designee shall notify the Investigator of any such interim measures.In addition to the foregoing, if the failure of an Investigator to comply with this policy or a management plan appears to have biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research, the University, through the provost\xe2\x80\x99s designee, shall promptly notify the PHS Awarding Component of the corrective action taken or to be taken, which action should also be included in the mitigation report referenced above. The University shall comply with directions from the PHS Awarding Component provided after such notification.In any case in which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines that a PHS- funded project of clinical research whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or a treatment has been designed, conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a FCOI that was not managed or reported by the University, the University, through the provost\xe2\x80\x99s designee, shall require the Investigator involved to disclose the FCOI in each public presentation of the results of the research and to request an addendum to previously published presentations.Appeals.In the event that agreement is not reached by all parties concerned with the management of a case of conflict of interest or potential or perceived conflict of interest, the aggrieved parties may pursue a grievance following the procedures in Appendix G of the University Handbook, but in no circumstances shall such appeal delay any time limitations with which the University must comply pursuant to federal regulations.\n.060 Use of University Name\nThe name of the Board of Regents, a Regents institution, or the Regents System may never be used as an endorsement of a faculty member or unclassified staff member\'s external activities without expressed and advance written approval of the University chief executive officer and/or the Board\'s President and Executive Officer, as appropriate. Faculty members or unclassified staff members may list their institutional affiliation in professional books, articles and monographs they author or edit and in connection with professional workshops they conduct or presentations they make without securing approval.\n.070 Sanctions\nFailure to make any annual report or other disclosure required herein, and any updates thereto, may result in a temporary moratorium on expenditure of federally sponsored project funding until compliance is achieved and may result in discipline in accordance with University procedures, ranging, for example, from the loss of the privilege of submitting grant proposals and receiving extra mural support to, in extreme cases, dismissal for cause (University Handbook C161.1).\n.080 Distribution and Dissemination\nThe policy statement will be distributed upon initial appointment to all applicable faculty and unclassified staff members by the University, and to all Investigators as defined herein, and when any revisions to this policy are made.\n.090 Questions\nQuestions concerning his policy should be addressed via email to PHSFCOI@k-state.edu.\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

the\xc2\xa0KBOR Social Media Policy,\xc2\xa0it must first be determined that such action is to be applied in a manner that is consistent with the First Amendment and academic freedom principles.\nThis determination is made by the President or President\xe2\x80\x99s delegate in consultation with University General Counsel for legal advice, and with consideration of a recommendation by a committee of peers.\n.020 Composition of Committee of Peers\nThe committee of peers consists of 3 individuals from the employee\xe2\x80\x99s peer constituency (faculty/professional staff/university support

the President\xe2\x80\x99s delegate.\xc2\xa0 The members of the committee cannot be from the same department/unit/college as the employee involved in the allegation.\n.030 Steps in the Process\nThe President or the President\xe2\x80\x99s delegate determines that there is a need for review of an incident for potential violation of the KBOR Social Media Policy that might warrant suspension without pay or termination for cause. The employee shall be notified in writing of such alleged violation.The President or the President\xe2\x80\x99s delegate contacts the appropriate senate president to form the committee of peers.The President charges the committee to review the proposed disciplinary action in accordance with this procedure and make a recommendation, with rationale, to the President or President\xe2\x80\x99s delegate as to whether the conduct violates the KBOR policy and whether the proposed action is consistent with First Amendment and academic freedom principles.The University General Counsel is to provide advice to the committee on the pertinent legal issues related to the KBOR Social Media Policy.The committee is to gather relevant information and make a written recommendation to the President or the President\xe2\x80\x99s delegate within 30 calendar days of receiving its charge.Employee will receive written notification either way of the ruling.\nThe procedure defined here does not preclude a university employee from using the grievance procedures defined by other university policies if and when they are applicable.\xc2\xa0 If such grievance is pursued by the employee, individuals that serve on the committee of peers shall not serve on related grievance hearing panel(s).\n.050 Questions\nQuestions concerning this policy should be addressed to the following offices:\nOffice of the President, (785) 532-6221Office of General Counsel, (785) 532-5730\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

of Contents\n.010\xc2\xa0Introduction\n.020\xc2\xa0Taxing Guidance\n.030\xc2\xa0Policy\n.040\xc2\xa0Administration\n.050\xc2\xa0Questions\n.010 Introduction\nIt is the practice of\xc2\xa0Kansas State University\xc2\xa0to recognize employees at the time of their retirement for their performance of duties and length of service. The University often awards various gifts and honoraria to its employees. Several methods are used to fund the retirement gifts. One method is for the employing department, college, or division to use funds already on deposit with the\xc2\xa0KSU Foundation\xc2\xa0to purchase a retirement gift. In other cases, cash contributions are collected from employees and friends, deposited in a KSU Foundation account and used to purchase a gift. In either case, the gift falls under an Internal Revenue policy that restricts the amount of non-taxable contributions given to an employee. The amount of the restriction depends on whether the university has a \"qualified plan\" for employee gifts other than cash. The policy stated below outlines the \"qualified plan\" for Kansas State University.\n.020 Taxing Guidance\nInternal Revenue Code Section 274(j) specifies that gifts, honoraria and tangible personal property may be given to an employee for various reasons, such as, length of service (retirement), productivity, or safety achievement. Cash gifts to employees are not eligible under this section of the code because any gift of cash exceeding $25 has traditionally been treated as compensation and reported as income on the employee\'s W-2. The code states that the allowable dollar amount limit for a tangible personal property gift is based on whether or not the employer has a \"qualified plan\". Without a \"qualified plan,\" a gift of tangible personal property may not exceed $400, but with a \"qualified plan,\" a gift of tangible personal property with a value up to $1,600 is permitted. The code also states the recipient must be employed for five years to be eligible for such an award and the employee must not have received a similar award in any of the prior four years.\n.030 Policy\nA dean, department head, director or individual representing the University in an official capacity, may provide a gift or honoraria of tangible personal property excluding cash, the aggregate of which will not exceed $1,600, to an employee in recognition of the employee\'s retirement from\xc2\xa0Kansas State University. Such gifts may include, but not limited to, honoraria administered by the\xc2\xa0KSU Foundation.\nLikewise, an employee may accept a gift(s) of tangible personal property excluding cash, the aggregate of which will not exceed $1,600 from the employer as represented by the employee\'s dean, department head, director or other individual representing the University in an official capacity.\nThis policy is effective November 15, 1997.\n.040 Administration\nThis policy will be administered by the deans, department heads, and directors of\xc2\xa0Kansas State University\xc2\xa0for compliance.\n.050 Questions\nHuman Resources (HR) is responsible for this policy. The Vice President or designee must approve any exception to this policy or related procedures. Questions should be directed to Human Resources, Benefits at 785-532-6277 or benefits@ksu.edu.\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];

opportunity for students to connect with other students who have similar interests. Student organizations can play an important role in developing student leadership skills, promoting personal growth, engaging in community service, and fostering a vibrant campus environment and experience.\nAll student organizations must be recognized, as defined below in this policy, with Student Programs and Involvement, or SPI, in the Division of Academic Success and Student Affairs to receive the privileges and benefits of university recognition. The purpose of receiving recognition by the university is to provide one path (of many available) for students to pursue opportunities, facilitate communications and streamline interactions between the university and the organizations.\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish the different classifications of student organizations, to define various roles within student organizations, and to provide criteria for organizations to achieve and maintain university recognition.\n.020 Definitions\nAdvisor: An advisor is a member of the university faculty or staff, on at least 0.5 FTE, who acts as the primary liaison between the university and the recognized student organization. All advisors are required to complete training as mandated by SPI and to annually sign the advisor acknowledgement. All recognized student organizations must have an advisor meeting these criteria at all times to maintain their recognition status. SPI has the right to not approve, or to remove approval, of advisors who meet the outlined criteria but who, in SPI\xe2\x80\x99s sole judgment and discretion, are not fit to serve as advisors. Graduate students may support faculty members or staff who are serving as advisors but may not themselves be an advisor. Advisors may not accept compensation beyond the pay and benefits designated in their university appointment paperwork.\nThe university acknowledges that organizations may have individuals who are not university faculty or staff and serve in a mentor or coaching capacity to the organizations, and SPI offers resources to help those individuals serve successfully; however, those individuals are acting in their own capacity and not on behalf of the university. It is entirely within the discretion of the organizations\xe2\x80\x99 members whether to invite and/or allow these individuals to participate with the recognized student organization, and SPI, within its sole judgment and discretion, may limit or remove access to any university resources it provides to these individuals.\nSPI: Student Programs and Involvement.\xc2\xa0SPI is the university office designated as the point of contact for recognized student organizations. SPI facilitates the recognition process and approves organizations for official recognition, provides informational materials to inquiring students, and offers programming that students in the groups may find helpful in running their organizations. For the purposes of this policy, SPI refers to the .\nDepartment:\xc2\xa0An official college, department, controlled corporation, or unit of Kansas State University. Also, as applicable and as defined below, the K-State Alumni Association, or KSAA, and KSU Foundation, or KSUF can be considered a department.\nMember(s):\xc2\xa0A member of an organization is any person who has met the organization\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for membership and is considered a voting member of the organization, by the organization.\nOrgCentral:\xc2\xa0The online student organization management system provided to recognized student organizations and requires authentication with an eID and password. For the purposes of this policy, OrgCentral refers to the technology and procedures utilized by the relevant office responsible for coordinating student organization recognition on each campus.\nRecognized Student Organization, or RSO: \xc2\xa0Any student organization that has completed and maintained the necessary requirements to be recognized by the university through SPI. A student organization is a voluntary special interest group organized for educational, social and service purposes and comprised of student members. Recognized student organizations are classified as either affiliated or sponsored, as defined and set out below.\nStudent:\xc2\xa0For purposes of this policy, a student is any person enrolled in at least one credit hour at Kansas State University during the current academic term.\xc2\xa0During the time frame between the spring and fall semesters, a person enrolled in at least one credit hour during the immediately preceding semester shall be considered a student for purposes of this policy.\nStudent Governing Association, or SGA:\xc2\xa0The student leaders of Kansas State University Student Governing Association are duly elected or appointed to positions in accordance with the constitution, by-laws and statutes of the association.\n.030 Classification of Recognized Student Organizations\nEach student organization granted recognition by the university is classified as sponsored or affiliated. SPI, in its sole judgment and discretion, determines an RSO\xe2\x80\x99s recognition classification. There are two classifications of RSOs:\nSponsored Organizations:\xc2\xa0Sponsored organizations are those considered congruent with the mission and culture of the university and operate as a part of a university department or unit. These organizations are inherently linked to the university because of their role representing K-State or in presenting events of broad appeal that are considered an integral part of the institution. Sponsored organizations routinely present events for the campus and the broader community, and typically work in a collaborative relationship with a university department or office. The organization\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and effect are to serve a broad segment of the campus community, not just its membership.\nA university department or unit \xe2\x80\x94 through a designated departmental employee assigned to serve as the organization\xe2\x80\x99s advisor \xe2\x80\x94 must provide oversight and direct responsibility for the organization and its activities. The applicable department or unit shall assign a staff or faculty member to be the advisor to the sponsored organization in accordance with RSO recognition requirements. These advisors are generally experienced in the respective organization\xe2\x80\x99s area of interest.\nThe KSAA and KSUF may be a sponsoring department of organizations whose purpose is directly related to the missions of the respective entity and the university and, for that limited purpose, shall be considered a department throughout this policy.\nKey indicators of sponsored organization status: A sponsored organization is not required to meet every indicator but collectively must reflect a substantial portion of the indicators as determined by SPI. These indicators include, but are not limited to:\nThe organization plays a critical role in the day-to-day functions and mission of a department.The organization is inherently linked to the university because of its role in representing K-State or in presenting events of broad appeal that are considered an integral part of the institution.The purpose and effect of the organization is to serve a broad segment of the campus community, not just its membership.The organization receives all or part of its funding from a department, and funds for the organization are maintained by the department with limited exceptions.The\xc2\xa0department has authority to establish, maintain or eliminate the organization.The\xc2\xa0department can recommend and require student leadership change.\nAffiliated Organizations:\xc2\xa0Affiliated organizations are those that are, in general, interest groups and provide engagement activities that are primarily for their direct membership. These groups are generally capable of functioning with minimal university support, but may receive support from a parent organization, including but not limited to regional/national/international governing organizations. While the university recognizes affiliated organizations and provides them with benefits as stated in this policy, the university also acknowledges that students may choose to form groups of varying interests that may or may not align with the university\xe2\x80\x99s Principles of Community. Affiliated organizations are not a department, unit, or agent of the university, and the university does not accept responsibility or liability for the activities undertaken by affiliated organizations.\n.040 Achieving and Renewing Recognition\nAn organization is a voluntary special interest group organized for educational, social, and service purposes and comprised of its members. Organizations can exist whether the university recognizes them pursuant to this policy. SPI determines the approval or denial of an application for recognition by organizations. Through university recognition, organizations receive some special privileges and benefits, as well as have certain responsibilities to the university community. The following are general requirements that must be met by all organizations to receive and renew recognition:\nOrganizations must be established for purposes that do not violate local, state, or federal law; are consistent with the broad educational mission of the university; and are supportive of the regulations, guidelines and policies of the university. The university recognizes that some student organizations may have a purpose to advocate for a change in existing law and this provision does not prevent the student organization from exercising its First Amendment right to do so.An organization with the same purpose as an existing RSO will not be allowed to receive recognition. SPI will examine every instance of similar purposes to determine if enough difference exists to permit more than one organization. If the groups are determined to have a substantially similar purpose, SPI will refer the students to the existing organization.Completing the annual recognition process is required once per academic year. A process for recognition will be established and maintained by SPI and made available on the department\xe2\x80\x99s website. \xc2\xa0The university recognizes that a nondiscriminatory environment complements its commitment to academic inquiry, intellectual discourse, and personal growth. The university also recognizes the interest of students to organize and associate with like-minded students. Accordingly, all\xc2\xa0RSOs acknowledge and agree to the following:\nThe established policy of the Board of Regents prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, race, color, religion, sex, marital status, national origin, physical handicap or disability, military veteran status, sexual orientation or other factors which cannot be lawfully considered, within the state universities. All fraternal and campus-related organizations shall follow this policy in the selection of their members, except the prohibition against sex discrimination shall not apply to social fraternities or sororities which are excluded from the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.).\nThe right of organizations to establish standards for membership is acknowledged, provided that all students are afforded equal opportunity to meet those standards.\xc2\xa0Just as all students have the right to choose those with whom they would associate on the campus, an organization shall have the right to select its members subject to these principles. Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted as imposing a requirement which would violate the principle of selection on the basis of individual merit.\nIn addition, this policy does not prohibit a student organization that is organized around shared religious beliefs from requiring leaders or members to adhere to the organization\xe2\x80\x99s sincerely held religious beliefs, comply with the organization's sincerely held religious beliefs, comply with the organization\xe2\x80\x99s sincere religious standards of conduct, and be committed to furthering the organization\xe2\x80\x99s religious missions, beliefs, observance requirements and standards of conduct as defined by the organization or the religion on which the association is based.\nThe organization must be nonprofit in nature. RSOs may not have the primary purpose of individual instruction, charging fees, or operating as a for-profit business. Organizations may not serve as \xe2\x80\x9cfronts\xe2\x80\x9d for off-campus groups in order to gain unauthorized use of meeting space or information tables for the off-campus user.New organizations must submit a constitution and/or bylaws at the time of making their initial request for recognition by the university. Constitutions and/or bylaws may be as elaborate or as simple as the organization chooses, provided it has the following minimum requirements: a purpose, membership requirements, officers of the organization, meeting processes and notification protocol, process for removing members/officers, process for dissolving the organization, and process for amending the constitution. RSOs should ensure the constitution and/or bylaws on record with SPI are up to date and accurate.Organizations must have at least a president (or parallel leadership position) and this role must be held by a currently enrolled student. Other positions are optional. The president is required to complete training annually as part of the recognition process.Organizations must maintain at least five student members of which will include the president. The president is responsible for ensuring the roster of members is always up to date on OrgCentral.Organizations must identify and disclose an advisor as defined in this policy. All advisors must complete the Advisor Acknowledgment form and required training on an annual basis.Recognition granted for residence hall associations, residence hall communities, sports clubs, and fraternities and sororities may be subject to additional policies administered by the respective office and/or organization.RSOs that own or control a building, such as a house where residents are primarily members, may be required to provide information associated with the building as specified in the Student Organization Handbook, including but not limited to the address of such building and proof of insurance on the building.Comply with applicable university policies and guidelines, including but not limited to this policy and the accompanying Student Organization Handbook, and abide by all local, state and federal laws.\nIn addition to the above general recognition requirements, sponsored RSOs also must meet the following requirements:\nThe department sponsoring the organization must complete an annual form verifying its sponsorship of the organization.The constitution of a sponsored RSO must state that the\xc2\xa0department has final say in matters of the organization.Membership must be restricted to 100% students.\nIn addition to the general recognition requirements, affiliated RSOs also must meet the following requirements:\nStudents must constitute more than 50% of the total members.Have no outstanding debt with the university at the time of recognition. If an affiliated RSO\xe2\x80\x99s debt to the university remains unpaid for 90 days or more, the university may suspend its recognition until the debt is paid.An affiliation with an international, national, regional or local organization is not a requirement of recognition for an affiliated organization. However, if an affiliated organization is affiliated with an international, national, regional or local organization or body that has governance or other supervisory authority over the organization, and the organization loses that affiliation by reason of de-recognition by that governing or supervisory organization or body, then upon proof of that de-recognition, the affiliated RSO shall also be derecognized by the university.\n.050 Benefits of Recognition\nRecognition gives RSOs access to a number of services and benefits. The following resources are available to all RSOs. Additional benefit listings can be found in the Student Organization Handbook.\nAccess to OrgCentral, including the ability to publicize events, store documents, create forms, develop a public-facing website, and communicate with group members.Eligible to use approved campus facilities for meetings and events at a free or reduced rate (this does not include Athletics Facilities, Alumni Center, and K-State Foundation facilities).Eligible to apply for student organization funding through the Student Governing Association.Eligible to apply for awards and honors presented to university RSOs and members.Eligible to market organization to current and prospective students\xc2\xa0through posters, chalking, tabling, digital displays, etc.Eligible to submit events and news to K-State Today\xc2\xa0newsletter.Eligible to submit events and news via SPI\xe2\x80\x99s communication channels including OrgCentral, SPI update newsletter, and digital displays dedicated to RSOs.Eligible to participate in SPI\xe2\x80\x99s organization events.Eligible to apply for product allocation, if available, from the university beverage vendor\xc2\xa0for events hosted on campus.Access to storage lockers and mailboxes in the K-State Student Union.Eligible to utilize approved university logos, images, name, and other brand components in accordance with university licensing policies and guidelines.Eligible to establish financial accounts within the K-State Foundation as appropriate.Eligible to request through SPI member eligibility lists to assist in connecting with prospective group members.Eligible to request through SPI grade checks to determine if membership requirements are met.Eligible to maintain off-campus financial accounts for funds generated independently from the university.\n.060 Organization Recognition Statuses\nThe following outlines each of the possible statuses an RSO may have at any point in time. Depending on the RSO\xe2\x80\x99s status, the requirements to complete recognition may differ.\xc2\xa0An organization may\xc2\xa0contact SPI\xc2\xa0to determine their status if unknown by the student organization membership.\nActive:\xc2\xa0Organizations which have completed the annual recognition requirements as outlined in Section .040 [link to anchor]\xc2\xa0of this policy.Inactive: Organizations which have not completed the annual recognition requirements for the current academic year are in Inactive status. Organizations with this status shall have no benefits. To become active the organization must complete the requirements outlined\xc2\xa0on SPI's website.Revoked: Organizations which\xc2\xa0have had their recognition status revoked\xc2\xa0due to non-compliance with university policies or at the request of organization leadership are in revoked status.\xc2\xa0Organizations with this status shall have no benefits. To become active the organization must complete the annual recognition requirements outlined. When an organization\xe2\x80\x99s recognition is revoked, additional requirements may be established which require completion before recognition may be received again.Provisional:\xc2\xa0Organizations who do not meet the minimum five-member requirement for active recognition, but meet all other requirements for achieving and renewing recognition as listed in section .040 of this policy, may register under a provisional status. Organizations with this status shall have limited benefits, and will need to complete requirements outlined on SPI website.\n.070 Process for Revoking Registration of an Organization\nIf an organization fails to meet and/or maintain the criteria for recognition as outlined in this policy and/or the Student Organization Handbook, SPI may revoke the organization\xe2\x80\x99s status as an RSO. This review and process is separate from PPM Chapter 8545 Student Organization Conduct Code and Process for Discipline, which reviews and sanctions behavioral concerns arising from an organization\xe2\x80\x99s activities.\nBy way of example and without limitation, the following is a non-exhaustive list of administrative reasons SPI may revoke an organization\xe2\x80\x99s status as an RSO:\nSubmission of material for recognition known or determined by SPI to be false.Failure to complete the outlined requirements annually.Failure to maintain any recognition requirement set forth in this policy.Failure to follow university policies and procedures or local, state and/or federals laws.Upon notification by the organization\xe2\x80\x99s national, regional or other parent entity with which it is affiliated that the organization has failed to follow the rules, policies or guidelines of the organization\xe2\x80\x99s national, regional or other parent entity.\nUpon identification of an organization\xe2\x80\x99s failure to meet the criteria for recognition, the organization will be given 10 days\xe2\x80\x99 notice of the administrative deficiency and an opportunity to cure. If at the end of the 10 days, the issue is not corrected to be in line with this policy or the Student Organization Handbook, SPI may revoke the organization\xe2\x80\x99s status as an RSO.\n.080 Relation to Student Conduct Policies\nAll student conduct matters reported to the university shall be governed by and reviewed under applicable university policies and practices, including but not limited to:\nStudent Code of ConductPPM Chapter 8545. Student Organization Conduct Code and Process for Discipline.PPM Chapter 3315. Threat Management Policy.Critical Incident Response Team ProcessPPM Chapter 3010. Policy Prohibiting Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Violence, and Stalking, and Procedure for Reviewing Complaints.\nAll policies are subject to the jurisdictional provisions set forth therein. The university also may, but is not required to, report matters of which it has knowledge to local, regional, national and/or international organizations or other governing body affiliated with an RSO, to the police for criminal matters, and to other applicable entities. Additionally, nothing in this policy shall be construed to prevent the university from taking appropriate risk management measures it deems necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion, based on a person's or persons' conduct.\n.090 List of Registered Student Organizations\nView a public list of recognized organizations.\n.100 Questions\nAny questions regarding this policy or recognition requirements for recognized organizations should be directed to Student Programs and Involvement, 114 K-State Student Union, 785-532-6541.

University\xe2\x80\x99s primary concern is the safety, health, and well-being of its students. The university encourages all members of the K-State community to care for themselves and others. Through this amnesty policy, the university empowers students to report alcohol and other drug-related emergencies, sexual harassment, discrimination and other harassment, physical assaults, threatening behavior, incidents of hazing, and similar behavioral concerns.\nThe purpose of this policy is to encourage students to report emergencies and other safety-related incidents by eliminating a potential barrier\xe2\x80\x94concern of being punished for minor conduct infractions. This policy applies to the application of the university\xe2\x80\x99s policies for students, including the Student Code of Conduct. At any point before or while reviewing conduct under a university policy, the university official responsible for the policy at issue may choose to apply this student amnesty policy.\xc2\xa0 After consideration of the incident and surrounding circumstances, the university official will, in their full discretion, make the final determination as to the applicability of this policy and reserves the right to adjust, reduce, or forgo sanctions or dismiss alleged violations. In making this determination, the university official will consider the university\xe2\x80\x99s goal of encouraging students to report safety concerns without fear of being disciplined for minor policy infractions. If the university official opts to forgo or dismiss sanctions, the incident will be documented, and the university may still assign informal educational interventions.\nThis student amnesty policy applies solely to the university\xe2\x80\x99s student discipline processes and does not limit the authority of law enforcement personnel or university staff to act as required at the time of an alleged violation of university policies or state or local laws. Nothing in this policy shall be construed as preventing the university from taking risk mitigation measures or otherwise addressing a substantial disruption to the university\xe2\x80\x99s operations. Further, nothing in this policy will limit the university from fulfilling its obligations to report incidents to appropriate university and law enforcement officials (i.e. Title IX and Clery).\n.020 Types of Amnesty\nAlcohol and Other Drug Related Emergencies\nIt is important for victims of alcohol- and drug-related emergencies to receive immediate medical treatment. K-State students seeking immediate medical assistance for an alcohol- or drug-related emergency on behalf of themselves or another person will not be sanctioned for violation of any university alcohol or drug-related policies, so long as the students:\nMake initial contact with law enforcement, emergency medical services, or university staff as a result of their actively seeking out medical assistance.Provide relevant contact information to the responding emergency medical personnel, law enforcement officers, and university staff.Remain on scene with the individual who reasonably appeared in need of medical assistance until the emergency medical assistance and law enforcement officers have arrived.Cooperate with responding emergency medical personnel, law enforcement officers, and university staff.\nThe university also encourages students to review K.S.A. 41-727(f)(1) (the \xe2\x80\x9cLifeline 911\xe2\x80\x9d law), which provides immunity from certain alcohol-related criminal infractions when an individual seeks medical assistance on behalf of themselves or another person, remains on the scene until law enforcement or emergency services arrive, and cooperates with and provides information to law enforcement or emergency medical services.\nVictims of and Witnesses to Serious Behavioral Concerns\nThis student amnesty policy shall apply to students who report to university staff, law enforcement, or emergency medical services having been subjected to or a witness of incidents of sexual harassment, discrimination and other harassment, physical assaults, threatening behavior, incidents of hazing, and similar serious behavioral concerns. Students who are engaged in minor violations, such as underage drinking, and cooperate with the university in providing information related to serious behavioral concerns by others will be provided amnesty for any minor violations they were engaged in at the time the underlying serious behavioral concern took place.\nThis student amnesty policy extends to individuals who make initial reports or serious behavioral concerns to university staff, law enforcement, or emergency medical services and to students who are later contacted by university staff or law enforcement and are requested to provide information about a serious behavioral concern they may have witnessed.\n.030 Questions\nQuestions about this policy should be directed to Student Support & Accountability at (785) 532-6432 or the Office of Institutional Equity\xc2\xa0at (785) 532-6220.\nContact us\nEmergency\nStatements and disclosures\nAccessibility\nKansas State University\nManhattan, KS 66506\n785-532-6011\n\xc2\xa9 Kansas State University\nUpdated: 9/22/23'"];
