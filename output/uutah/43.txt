Title IX (On-Campus) Reporting
Submit a Title IX Complaint (Sexual Misconduct)
What is Title IX?
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination against all genders in educational institutions. Schools are required to ensure that campuses are free of sex discrimination and have an established procedure for handling complaints. The University of Utah has a Title IX coordinator to handle complaints of sex discrimination, including complaints of sexual assault and harassment:

Know Your Title IX
What is the Title IX reporting process like?
When disclosing information to a Title IX investigator, you may be asked for a description of the incident including the date, time, location, and information about the perpetrator(s). Reports of sexual misconduct are processed through the Title IX Coordinator, who is housed in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA). If you or a mandatory reporter disclose information to the OEO/AA, you may be contacted to provide more information. Throughout the process, you can control the information you share and can choose to stop sharing at any point. You may also choose to file a formal complaint and proceed with an investigation or resolve the matter through informal resolution.
Supportive Measures are available to help support you, whether or not you wish to file a formal complaint with our office. Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge.  If you choose, we can work with the appropriate campus office to obtain extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, refer you to counseling and/or victim advocacy services, and also implement safety and protective measures, such as no-contact directives, campus escort services, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus and other similar measures. You may also request one-on-one training, education, or other requests as defined by you such as asking us to tell the other party that their behavior is expected to stop.  Training may be able to be implemented anonymously but that may limit our ability to address the behavior. Supportive Measures are available, whether or not you file a Formal Complaint with OEO/AA.
Choosing to report an incident of sexual misconduct can feel empowering for a survivor. However, the reporting process can be emotionally difficult. Some students may be reluctant to report to the police. Some students may also be wary of re-victimization and re-traumatization. The survivor should have the choice of whether or not to report and continue with an investigation. Talking to a confidential resource can help a survivor decide which options are best for them.
What is the investigation/adjudication process like?
Each investigation and adjudication process is individualized, but the following is a basic outline of the Title IX process related to allegations of sexual misconduct.  Under Title IX, there are two different types of cases:  1) Sexual misconduct is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors. It includes Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment, Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Violence, Stalking, Nonconsensual Sexual Contact, and Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration. Sexual Misconduct is a type of Sex or Gender-Based Discrimination; and 2) Discrimination - Being treated differently because of sex/gender.
After a Title IX formal complaint is filed, the complaint is assessed to determine whether or not the conduct violates the university's nondiscrimination policies. Both the complaining party (person making the complaint) and the responding party (person who is accused of misconduct) are interviewed for information regarding the complaint. Parties may have an advisor of their choice with them when being interviewed. When available, documentary evidence is reviewed, and witnesses are interviewed as well. Investigations may take up to 60 days or the parties will be informed of the reasons the investigation cannot be completed within 60 days.
1) Procedures for sexual misconduct cases:
At the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO will issue recommendations that are published in a report that is shared with both parties to the complaint. Recommendations are categorized as either “cause,” or “insufficient evidence” as to whether university policy was violated.
If the OEO recommends that there is cause to believe that university policy has been violated, recommendations for disciplinary actions (sanctions) will be made. In the case of students, the Office of the Dean of Students makes recommendations for sanctions.
After the issuance of the OEO report, a hearing will be scheduled before a three-person hearing committee.  The hearing committee will make the decision whether or not a violation of university policy has occurred. The Hearing Committee will also make the decision as to any sanctions should be imposed against the Respondent and any remedies that should be provided to the Complainant.  Parties may have one advisor and one support person of their choice present at hearings. If a party does not have an advisor, a university-appointed advisor will be appointed, without fee or charge to the party.  A university-appointed advisor cannot provide advice, including legal advice to a party.  The role of a University-appointed advisor is for the sole purpose of conducting questioning of the other party, any witnesses, and any others who have provided information as part of the investigative or hearing process.  Hearings are usually held using Zoom or other similar technology. Students and staff may appeal the decision of the hearing committee to the applicable vice president. Faculty may appeal the decisions of the hearing committee to the president.
2) Procedures for sex/gender discrimination cases:
At the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO will issue findings that are published in a report that is shared with both parties to the complaint. Recommendations are categorized as either “cause,” or “insufficient evidence” as to whether university policy was violated.
If the OEO recommends that there is cause to believe that university policy has been violated, recommendations for disciplinary actions (sanctions) will be made. In the case of students, the Office of the Dean of Students makes recommendations for sanctions.
In discrimination cases, a hearing is not automatically scheduled.  Rather, either party may request a hearing before a hearing committee.  The process is similar to a sexual misconduct hearing as described above.  Parties may choose to have one advisor and one support person; except university-provided advisors are not appointed if a party does not have an advisor of their choice.

Title IX - Sexual Misconduct
University of Utah policy prohibits sex discrimination, which includes sexual misconduct.
Sexual Misconduct is the most egregious form of sex discrimination. Title IX of the
Education Amendments Act of 1972 is the comprehensive federal law that prohibits discrimination
on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity.
Policies, procedures, and resources are in place to take immediate and appropriate
steps to remedy violations of University policy and the university will take steps
to end or eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence and to remedy
the effects, as appropriate under each individual’s circumstances.
Complaints of sexual misconduct should be made directly to the Office of Equal Opportunity
and Affirmative Action.
Please see the Title IX Coordinator Outreach letter to learn about your specific rights to seek out Supportive Measures and options for
accountability through the OEO/AA process or through law enforcement.

Definitions
Sexual Misconduct
As defined by University Rule, R1-012: Discrimination Complaint Rule, Sexual Misconduct
is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors including Sexual or Gender-Based
Harassment, Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Exploitation, Stalking, Nonconsensual
Sexual Contact, and Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration. Sexual Misconduct also includes
the crimes of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking as defined
by state and federal law. Sexual Misconduct is a form of Sex Discrimination. The following
definitions of prohibited conduct apply to University policies.
Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment
As defined by University Rule, R1-012, Discrimination Complaint Rule, Sexual Harassment
means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature or based on an individual’s sex, sexual orientation, gender,
gender identity, or gender expression when:
Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition
of an individual’s employment, education, living environment, health care or participation
in a university program activity;
Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
or a factor in decisions affecting that individual’s employment, education, living
environment, or participation in a university program or activity; or
Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual’s employment
or educational performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment
for that individual’s employment, education, living environment, or participation
in a university program or activity.
Consent
Consent means affirmative, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement. For a nonexhaustive
list of situations in which consent has not been given, see Utah Code Ann. 76-5-406.
Interpersonal Partner Violence
means actual or threatened physical violence, intimidation, or other forms of physical
or sexual abuse that would cause a reasonable person to fear harm to self or others.
For this policy, “intimate relationship” means marriage, domestic partnership, engagement,
casual or serious romantic involvement, and dating, whether in a current or former
relationship. Intimate Partner Violence can occur between persons of any sex, sexual
orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, and it can occur in any
type of intimate relationship including monogamous, non-committed, and relationships
involving more than two partners. Intimate Partner Violence can be a single act or
a pattern of behavior. Intimate Partner Violence is sometimes referred to as, and
includes behaviors that would be considered, dating violence, domestic violence, or
relationship abuse. Examples of Intimate Partner Violence include, but are not limited
to, situations in which the following behaviors are directed toward a partner in a
current or former intimate relationship: hitting, kicking, strangling, or other violence;
property damage; and threat of violence to one’s self, one’s partner, or the family
members, friends, pets, or personal property of the partner. Intimate Partner Violence
is a form of Sexual Misconduct.
Nonconsensual Sexual Contact
means any physical contact with another person of a sexual nature without that person’s
Consent. The touching of a person’s intimate parts (such as genitalia, groin, breast,
buttocks, mouth, or clothing covering same); touching a person with one’s own intimate
parts; or forcing a person to touch another’s intimate parts would be violations of
this policy if they occur without Consent. Nonconsensual Sexual Contact is a form
of Sexual Misconduct.
Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration
means the sexual penetration of any bodily opening with any object or body part without
Consent. This could be committed by force, threat, intimidation, or through exploitation of
another’s mental or physical condition (such as lack of consciousness, incapacitation
due to drugs or alcohol, age, or disability) of which the Respondent was actually
aware or which a reasonable person in the Respondent’s position should have been aware.
Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration is a form of Sexual Misconduct.
Sex Discrimination
means treating someone differently, i.e., disadvantaging the person, on the basis
of sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression when:
such conduct adversely affects a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
education, living environment, or participation in a University program or activity;
or
a person’s sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression is used
as the basis for or a factor in decisions affecting that individual’s employment,
education, living environment, health care, or participation in a University program
or activity.
Sexual Violence
means any physical sexual act perpetrated against a person’s will or where a person
is incapable of giving consent (e.g., due to age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because
an intellectual or other disability prevents the person from having the capacity to
give consent).
Stalking
means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person and based on that’s
person’s sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, that
would cause a reasonable person to fear for the person’s safety or the safety of others
or suffer substantial emotional distress. Stalking is a form of Sexual Misconduct.
The Free and Open Discussion
Discussion of issues or theories relating to sexuality or gender in an academic or
professional setting, when appropriate to subject matter, will be presumed not to
constitute sexual harassment even if it offends or embarrasses an individual unless
other factors are involved. Such factors include targeting the discussion to an individual
or carrying out the discussion in terms that are both patently unnecessary and gratuitously
offensive.
Mandatory Reporting
Under university policy, most University employees are required to report situations
involving sexual misconduct and discrimination to the Office of Equal Opportunity
and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA)
Some situations may be very personal; we respect your privacy and will protect it
in accordance with University of Utah policy and FERPA. Although information about
the situation may be reported to the OEO/AA, you have the right to choose to whom
you speak, what you say, when you say it and what resources you use. If you prefer
to speak first with a confidential resource (confidential resources are not required
to report information to the OEO/AA, you may contact one of the groups below.
Information provided to OEO/AA is considered private information and will only be shared with other appropriate university personnel on
a very strict need-to-know basis.

Title IX
Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972:
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
Essentially, Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions that receive federal funding (the vast majority of schools). While Title IX is a very short statute, Supreme Court decisions and guidance from the U.S. Department of Education have given it a broad scope covering sexual harassment and sexual violence. Under Title IX, schools are legally required to respond and remedy hostile educational environments and failure to do so is a violation that means a school could risk losing its federal funding.
While Title IX was previously a powerful tool to stop sexual violence and harassment in schools, On August 14th, 2020, the Department’s new Title IX rule went into effect. Make no mistake: the Rule drastically rolls back protections for student survivors and makes it easier for schools to sweep sexual harassment under the rug. Visit our Hands off IX resources and toolkit to learn more about your rights in light of the rule and how you hold school administrations accountable.
The below resources are intended to help you determine if your school is in compliance with Title IX. Although these resources have been written with the guidance of legal experts, we are not lawyers, and the information on this website does not constitute legal advice. We encourage you to contact a lawyer to discuss your complaint or suit.
Notices of Nondiscrimination
Title IX Coordinators
Clear Grievance Procedures
Prompt Responses to Violence
Under Title IX, schools must disseminate a notice of nondiscrimination. This notice does not have to specify that sexual harassment and violence are likewise prohibited, but the U.S. Department of Education (ED) recommends that schools do, since a notice that makes it unclear may qualify as a violation of Title IX. This notice is likely available in a student handbook or code of conduct in elementary and secondary schools and in an Annual Security Report (ASR) in higher education institutions.
This notice prohibiting sex discrimination must be widely distributed, available, and easily accessible to the school community each year. ED recommends schools:
Publish this policy online and have it available in print across campus so that school members may understand its purpose and utility
Include enough detail in the policy so that members of the community can realize sexual harassment and sexual violence are prohibited forms of sex discrimination
Title IX rule requires every educational institution receiving federal funding to have a Title IX Coordinator. The contact information (name/title, office address, telephone number, email address) of the Coordinator should be available both in your school’s nondiscrimination notice, but also in an annual security report or higher education institutions. Both victims and third parties should contact the Coordinator to report incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual violence.
The Title IX Coordinator ensures schools are compliant with Title IX, coordinates the investigation and disciplinary process, and looks for patterns or systematic problems with compliance to ensure schools fulfill all their federal obligations. The Coordinator may not have any other job responsibility that creates a conflict of interest with their responsibilities under Title IX. For example, the Title IX coordinator may not also sit on a disciplinary board or serve as legal counsel to the college.
When a school does not have a Title IX Coordinator or list that individual’s contact information, then your college is non-compliant with Title IX.
If the Coordinator has another job responsibility that creates conflicts of interest, your school is likely in violation of Title IX.
Schools are required to adopt and publish a grievance procedure outlining the complaint, investigation, and disciplinary process for addressing sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence occurring within “education program or activity” which the Department states “includes locations, events, or circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a post-secondary institution.” This process should address discrimination perpetrated by students, employees, or third parties, but only if the respondent is currently enrolled or employed by the school. Additionally, school security and/or law enforcement personnel must notify survivors  of their rights to use the school’s grievance procedure in addition to being able to file a criminal complaint.
This grievance procedure requires the school’s process be “prompt and equitable,” meaning it must be a timely response to discrimination and provide both parties equivalent rights during the disciplinary process rather than having one-sided due process.t.
Where the Rule falls short, states and schools must implement policies to uphold students’ right to a timely and trauma-informed investigation, written or electronic notes of any meeting, and a review of all available and relevant evidence.
While sexual misconduct complaints may be resolved through informal mechanisms, such as mediation, students are not required to use informal methods of grievance resolution and should not be pressured into such a process.
In addition to being obligated to survivors, schools must address hostile educational environments created by sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence school-wide. Addressing a hostile environment means remedying a current situation, addressing its effects, and preventing its recurrence in the future. Schools may meet this obligation through providing educational and awareness programming on sexual harassment or discrimination.
Employee Training: Both the Clery Act and Title IX rule require school employees that address sexual violence complaints to have appropriate training. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) also recommends that professors, campus police, administrators, counselors, health center staff, cleaning staff, coaches, resident advisers and others likely to receive reports be trained on how to identify and report sexual harassment and violence.
According to the Department of Education, schools need to:
Ensure that responsible employees with the authority to address sexual violence know how to respond appropriately to reports of sexual violence; that other responsible employees know that they are obligated to report sexual violence to appropriate school officials; and that all other employees understand how to respond to reports of sexual violence.
Make sure professional counselors, pastoral counselors, and non-professional counselors or advocates understand the extent to which they may keep a report confidential.
Provide training to all employees likely to witness or receive reports of sexual violence, including teachers, professors, school law enforcement unit employees, school administrators, school counselors, general counsels, athletic coaches, health personnel, and resident advisors.
A school also should train responsible employees to inform students of:
The reporting obligations of responsible employees;
Students’ option to request confidentiality and available confidential advocacy, counseling, or other support services; and
Their right to file a Title IX complaint with the school and to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement.
While sexual misconduct complaints may be resolved through informal mechanisms, such as mediation, students are not required to use informal methods of grievance resolution and should not be pressured into such a process.

The reporting obligations of responsible employees;
Students’ option to request confidentiality and available confidential advocacy, counseling, or other support services; and
Their right to file a Title IX complaint with the school and to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement.
Schools are required to be prompt when receiving a complaint of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual violence in order to remedy any hostile educational environment created by such behaviors. ED has not provided details on the length of time they consider to be “prompt,” but will evaluate a school’s effort to conduct a fair, impartial investigation in a timely manner. If the length of your investigation has impeded on your access to an education and further created a hostile environment you may have grounds for an OCR complaint. A simultaneous police investigation does not remove a school’s responsibility to resolve a complaint under Title IX. While a school may delay its response to accommodate a police investigation, schools that delay the Title IX complaint process unreasonably are in violation of Title IX."
Reporting Options:Title IX Guidance reminded schools that they have an obligation under the Clery Act to inform victims of their reporting options. Schools must notify victims of their right to report to police and facilitate that process if desired by the victim. Victims also have the right not to report to the police.
Regardless of a victim’s choice to report to the police, a victim may use a school’s grievance procedure to address sexual harassment or sexual violence or merely seek accommodations. When reasonable, schools must accommodate a victim on campus to remedy a hostile environment on a school’s campus. This means schools may change academic or extracurricular schedules to prevent an ongoing hostile education environment or put in place safety measures, such as a no-contact directive or facilitate a student obtaining a restraining order. The burden of accommodations or safety measures should not be solely placed on the victim, as this may be seen as a violation of Title IX."

The burden of accommodations or safety measures should not be solely placed on the victim, as this may be seen as a violation of Title IX."
Equitable Complaint Processes: Under Title IX, both the accuser and accused have equal rights, such as the right to:
Have an adviser of choice present during the process (this includes an attorney if allowed at all by schools)
Present evidence or have witnesses speak on their behalf
Have timely access to information that will be used at the hearing
Be present at pre-hearing meetings that provide an opportunity to present their testimony
Receive the final hearing decision in writing at the same time as the other party without being required to sign a non-disclosure agreement
Have the right to appeal a final decision (The 2017 Interim Guidance states that a school may choose to allow appeals solely by the responding party or by both parties. Learn more.)
In addition, since Title IX is a federal civil right, the appropriate standard of evidence is a “preponderance of the evidence.” This standard of evidence means that a hearing must determine whether a complaint of sex discrimination is “more likely than not” to have occurred or 51% likely to have occurred. This standard applies for all complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment and violence, because Title IX outlines standards for school disciplinary processes — not criminal complaints, which require the highest standard of evidence, “beyond a reasonable doubt.”
The 2017 Interim Guidance allows schools to use the “clear and convincing” evidence standard, but only if all other forms of campus misconduct investigations utilize this standard.
Retaliation:As a federal civil right, Title IX automatically protects any individual who reports sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual violence against retaliation. This means employees and third party reports are protected along with reporting victims from any adverse consequence, harassment, intimidation, or discrimination that is causally related to reporting sex discrimination under Title IX. Schools must protect against other employees or students retaliating against a reporting party when it “knows or should know” about the retaliatory harassment or behavior.
If a school discourages or threatens you about discussing complaints of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual violence, this may be considered retaliation.

Current Page: Rule 1-012B: Sexual Misconduct Complaint Process Rule
[Interim] Rule 1-012B: Sexual Misconduct Complaint Process Rule.
Revision 3. Effective date: March 16, 2022
Purpose and Scope
The University of Utah (“University”) is committed to providing and fostering an environment
that is safe and free from Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination. Among
other forms of prohibited Discrimination, University Policy prohibits Discrimination
on the basis of sex, which includes all forms of Sexual Misconduct. University Policy
also prohibits Retaliation against individuals for engaging in protected activities,
such as filing a Discrimination Complaint or participating in a Discrimination Complaint
process.
This rule outlines the process the University will use to resolve Complaints of Sexual
Misconduct. This rule is also intended to educate the University community, including
current students, prospective students and employees, about Sexual Misconduct and
about campus resources and processes available to victim-survivors of Sexual Misconduct.
Definitions
For purposes of Policy 1-012 and its associated Rules and Guideline, including this Rule 1-012B, the definitions
of prohibited Discrimination and other words and phrases are provided in Rule 1-012.
Rule
Prevention and Awareness. The University offers comprehensive programing intended to end Dating Violence, Domestic
Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking. The University provides education and training
designed to raise awareness of these issues and engages in efforts that aim to reduce
harm, improve communication skills, foster healthy relationships, improve bystander
intervention skills, and educate the campus community on the definitions of Consent,
Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking through orientations
each semester given to incoming students. The University of Utah Department of Public
Safety (“UDPS”) offers sexual assault education and information programs to University
students and employees upon request. Literature on date rape education, risk reduction,
and University response, as well as educational programs about the same, are available
through various University Student Affairs offices including the Office of Housing
& Residential Education and through the University's Center for Student Wellness.
The University provides primary prevention and awareness programs for incoming students
and new employees, and ongoing programs for students, staff, and faculty which includes:
a statement that the University prohibits the offenses of Domestic Violence, Dating
Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking;
the Utah statutory definitions of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,
and stalking;
the Utah statutory definitions of consent, in reference to sexual activity;
safe and positive options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an
individual to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of Domestic Violence,
Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking;
information on risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior, information
for those who may be at risk to perpetrate harm, and how to avoid potential attacks;
and
definitions of Sexual Misconduct under University Policy, as well as a copy of University
Policy 1-012, Rules 1-012, 1-012A, and 1-012B, and Guidline 1-012.
Initial Response. The first priority of any person who has been subject to Sexual Violence should be
to get to a safe place and then obtain necessary medical treatment and emotional support.
Victim-survivors may seek and receive a medical forensic examination free of charge
from a local hospital emergency department without submitting a police report. The
University strongly encourages victim-survivors to report all incidents of Sexual
Misconduct as soon as possible. Time is a critical factor for evidence collection
and preservation.
Role of Law Enforcement. The victim-survivor of an incident of Sexual Violence (rape,
fondling, incest, statutory rape), Dating Violence, Domestic Violence and Stalking
is encouraged, but not required, to report the incident directly to the University
Department of Public Safety (“UDPS”) or the local law enforcement entity for the jurisdiction
in which the incident took place.
Alternatively, or in conjunction with a report to law enforcement, victim-survivors
may make a report to the Office of Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (OEO/AA)
(see Section (III)(C)), the Office of the Dean of Students, a Housing & Residential
Education representative, and/or another University representative. Filing a police
report will not obligate the victim-survivor to pursue a complaint through the criminal
process. Filing a police report will:
ensure the victim-survivor receives appropriate medical treatment, including a medical
forensic exam at no expense;
provides the opportunity for collection of evidence helpful in prosecution, which
cannot be obtained later (ideally, a victim-survivor of Sexual Violence should not
wash, use the toilet, or change clothing prior to a medical forensic exam); and
provide the victim-survivor with available resources, including supportive resources.
A victim-survivor may request any University representative to assist them in notifying
law enforcement authorities about an incident of Sexual Violence (rape, fondling,
incest, statutory rape) Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking and any other
behavior that may constitute a crime.
When a victim-survivor contacts the UDPS, the UDPS will notify the Title IX Coordinator,
the OEO/AA, and the Office of the Dean of Students (if related to a student). A victim-
survivor may choose for an investigation to be pursued either through the criminal
justice system, through this rule, or both. Victim-survivors may also choose not to
proceed in the criminal justice system or under this rule (subject to Section (III)(D)
of this rule). A representative from the Center for Student Wellness Victim-Survivor
Advocacy program, Chief Safety Office Community Services Division, UDPS, the Office
of the Dean of Students, the Title IX Coordinator, and/or the OEO/AA will guide the
victim-survivor through the available options.
Where applicable, UDPS will enforce orders of protection, no contact orders, restraining
orders, civil stalking injunctions, or similar lawful orders issued by a criminal,
civil, or tribal court.
Role of the OEO/AA. The OEO/AA is the University department charged with responding to reports and investigating
Formal Complaints of Discrimination, including Sexual Misconduct.
The Director of the OEO/AA serves as the University’s Title IX Coordinator.

Suite OEO, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 Phone: (801) 581-8365 Fax: (801) 585-5746 oeo@utah.edu www.oeo.utah.edu
Upon receipt of a report of alleged Sexual Misconduct, Complainants will promptly
receive information from the Title IX Coordinator that:
provides the Complainant with written notification of and assist the Complainant in
accessing counseling, mental health and healthcare, victim advocacy, legal, academic
support, and other resources available in the community and on-campus;
offers and discusses Supportive Measures with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint;
considers the Complainant's wishes with respect to Supportive Measures;
explains the process for filing a Formal Complaint; and
informs the Complainant of the right to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement
and provide the Complainant with assistance, if requested.
Confidentiality.1 The University encourages victim-survivors of Sexual Misconduct to talk to someone
about what happened. Different employees on campus have different requirements to
maintain a victim- survivor’s confidentiality.
Completely Confidential. Professional and pastoral counselors are completely confidential,
except any reporting required by state and federal law, and do not report any information
disclosed by a Complainant to the University or to the OEO/AA.
Limited Confidentiality. Nonprofessional counselors and advocates (e.g., individuals
who are not professional counselors and who work or volunteer, including front desk staff
and students, in the University Counseling Center, Center for Student Wellness, Center
for Student Wellness Victim-Survivor Advocacy program, Ombuds Office, or counseling
services in the Women’s Resource Center, must report only general information about
crimes required to be reported under the Clery Act to the Chief Safety Office — such
as the nature, date, time, and general location of the incident—in a way that does
not identify the individuals involved.
Clery Reporting Requirements. Under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the
Clery Act, the University is required to complete publicly available record- keeping
on crimes required to be reported by the Clery Act in accordance with federal law,
but will not disclose identifying information. The University will maintain as confidential
any Protective Measures provided to the victim-survivor, to the extent that maintaining
such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the institution to provide the
Protective Measures.
Confidential Resources. The following are resources are confidential. *These offices must report general information about crimes reportable under the
Clery Act to the Chief Safety Office in a way that does not identify the individuals involved, such as the nature, date, time, and general location of
the incident. This information is required to be included in the University’s Annual
Security Report under the Clery Act, and in rare circumstances may result in the issuance
of a timely warning or other University obligations under Clery/VAWA.

Reporting to Mandatory Reporters.
A Mandatory Reporter must promptly report to the Title IX Coordinator all relevant
details about the alleged Sexual Misconduct shared by a Complainant—including the
names of the Complainant and alleged Respondent(s), any witnesses, and any other relevant
facts, including the date, time and specific location of the alleged incident.
Before a Complainant reveals any information to a Mandatory Reporter, the Mandatory
Reporter should ensure that the Complainant understands the Mandatory Reporter's reporting
obligations. If the Complainant wants to maintain confidentiality, the Mandatory Reporter
should direct the Complainant to confidential resources.
If the Complainant wants to tell the Mandatory Reporter what happened but also requests
confidentiality, requests that no investigation occur, or requests that no action
be taken against the Respondent, the Mandatory Reporter should tell the Complainant
that the University will consider the request, but cannot guarantee that the University
will be able to honor it.
Requests for Confidentiality. If a Complainant discloses an incident to a Mandatory Reporter but wishes to maintain
confidentiality, or requests that no investigation into a particular incident be conducted
or disciplinary action taken, the University must weigh that request against the University’s
obligation to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment for all students, including
the Complainant.
The University has designated the Title IX Coordinator to evaluate requests for allegations
of Sexual Misconduct.
If the University determines that it cannot maintain a Complainant’s confidentiality,
the University will inform the Complainant prior to starting an investigation and
will, to the extent possible, only share information with people responsible for handling
the University’s response.
Supportive Measures. When the University receives information about alleged Sexual Misconduct, an appropriate
University representative (such as the Dean of Students, cognizant supervisor, or
Human Resources (HR) representative) may offer Supportive Measures to either or both
parties which will generally remain in effect throughout and potentially beyond the
duration of the University investigation. Supportive Measures will be offered under
the auspices of the Title IX Coordinator; University representatives should consult
with the Title IX Coordinator in offering any Supportive Measures. The University
will offer Supportive Measures if they are reasonably available, regardless of whether
the Complainant chooses to file a complaint with the OEO/AA or with law enforcement.
Because the University is under a continuing obligation to address the issue of Sexual
Misconduct campus-wide, reports of Sexual Misconduct (including non-identifying reports)
will also prompt the University to consider broader remedial action.
Amnesty. An individual who makes a good faith report of Sexual Harassment or Sexual Misconduct
that was directed at them or another person will not be sanctioned for a violation
related to the use of drugs or alcohol that is related to the report.
Non-Disclosure of Information. Parties will be provided evidence obtained by the OEO/AA as part of the investigation
that is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint (the "Evidence");
the parties and party advisors must keep all such evidence strictly confidential and
use such evidence solely for the purposes of participating in the Sexual Misconduct
investigation and grievance process. Parties who disseminate or use such evidence
for any other purpose may be subject to discipline.
OEO/AA Investigation. In cases of Sexual Misconduct, the OEO/AA will begin an investigation upon acceptance
of a Formal Complaint. The University will not require a Complainant to participate
in any investigation or disciplinary proceeding; however, failure to participate may
limit the University’s ability to respond.
Upon acceptance of a Formal Complaint, the OEO/AA will provide written notice:
to the appropriate University administrator, which may include the supervisor, Chair,
Dean, and/or cognizant Vice President with responsibility over the Respondent and
any others with a legitimate business need.
If the Respondent is a student, the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Office
of Dean of Students will also be notified.
If the Respondent is a Vice President, another Vice President will be selected as
the cognizant Vice President for purposes of this rule.
to the Complainant and the Respondent providing:
the applicable policies and associated rules by which the proceedings will be governed;
sufficient details of the allegations including the identities of the parties involved,
the date and location of the alleged incident(s), and the conduct allegedly constituting
a violation of University Policy, if known;
a statement that each party will have an equal opportunity to submit and review evidence
throughout the investigation;
a statement that the Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct
until a determination is made at the conclusion of the grievance process;
a statement informing the Complainant and Respondent that they may have one advisor
of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be an attorney and one Support
Person of their choice; and
that Rule 1-012(III)(D)(10) prohibits knowingly making false statements or knowingly
submitting false statements during the grievance process.
If, during the course of the investigation, allegations arise about the Complainant
or Respondent that were not included in the initial notice, the OEO/AA will provide
notice of the additional allegations and provide the Respondent with an opportunity
to respond.
The Respondent shall be afforded a full opportunity to respond to the allegations
contained in the Complaint. Failure to respond or participate in an interview by the
Respondent or a witness will not prevent the completion of the investigation.
The OEO/AA will not draw an inference about the determination of responsibility based
solely on a party’s or witness’s decision not to participate in the investigative
or hearing process; however, evidence for review will be limited to that provided
by parties and witnesses who participate in the investigation.
The OEO/AA shall interview the Complainant, the Respondent, and may interview any
other person with relevant information. The OEO/AA will objectively review all relevant
information, including that which is submitted by the parties.
The Complainant and the Respondent may each be accompanied at any meetings or interviews
with the OEO/AA by one advisor who may be, but does not have to be, an attorney. During
the investigation, the advisor may only advise the Complainant or Respondent and may
not actively participate. Prior to the hearing, any advisor is at the Complainant
or Respondent’s own expense.
The Complainant and the Respondent may each be accompanied at any meetings or interviews
by one Support Person. The Support Person's role is to provide support to the Complainant
or Respondent and cannot speak on behalf of the party.
At the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO/AA shall issue the draft of its investigative
report (“OEO Draft”) simultaneously to the parties and their advisors, if any, in
an electronic or hard copy format. The OEO Draft shall include:
a summary of the relevant evidence;
an analysis of whether the evidence, evaluated under a Preponderance of the Evidence
standard, supports a recommendation that Sexual Misconduct occurred;
any mitigating or aggravating factors; and
any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the
allegations raised in the Formal Complaint.
To protect the privacy of witnesses and all parties involved, and pursuant to Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and other state and federal privacy laws,
names and other personally identifiable information may be redacted from the copies
of the OEO Draft Report and the OEO Report that are provided to the Complainant and
Respondent.
Both parties shall have ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the OEO Draft Report
to submit written comments and any additional documents and/or evidence to the OEO/AA.
If information from either party raises new issues or allegations, the OEO/AA may
conduct additional investigation.
At the conclusion of the OEO/AA’s investigation, the OEO/AA shall issue a final investigative
report (“OEO Report”) simultaneously to the parties and their advisors, if any, and
the appropriate administrator with responsibility over the Respondent in an electronic
or hard copy format. The OEO Report shall include:
a summary of the relevant evidence;
an analysis of whether the evidence, evaluated under a Preponderance of the Evidence
standard, supports a recommendation that Sexual Misconduct occurred;
any mitigating or aggravating factors; and
any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the
allegations raised in the Formal Complaint.
Upon determining a recommended sanction, the appropriate administrator will provide
written notice of a recommended sanction to the parties, to the OEO/AA, and the Hearing
Coordinator, and to the cognizant Vice President with responsibility over the Respondent
and any others with a legitimate business need, contemporaneous with the OEO/AA issuing
the OEO Report.
At the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO/AA shall convene a Hearing Committee
(“Committee”). This Committee shall serve as the decision-maker with regard to the
allegations of Sexual Misconduct, any associated disciplinary sanction or other corrective
measures, and any remedies for the Complainant. The Committee shall make an independent
judgment in objectively evaluating relevant evidence to reach a determination regarding
responsibility, independent from the recommendation from the investigator or the appropriate
administrator.
Hearing Process.
Hearings should take place as soon as practicable, but should be no less than fifteen
(15) and no more than forty (40) calendar days from the issuance of the OEO Report.
Although the OEO/AA Hearing Coordinator may endeavor to find a hearing date that will
be convenient for all the parties involved, the Hearing Coordinator and Committee
Chair have the final authority for determining the date of the hearing.
General Provisions for Hearings.
A Hearing Coordinator may facilitate the work of the Committee. Hearing Coordinator
responsibilities include:
serve as the Secretary to the Committee;
notify the Complainant, the Respondent, the Committee, and the OEO/AA of the date
and time of the hearing;
notify the Complainant and the Respondent of the names of the Committee members and
any witnesses requested by the Complainant, the Respondent, or the Committee;
notify persons requested by the Committee, Complainant, and/or Respondent to testify
at the hearing of the time and place of the hearing.
distribute the Hearing Procedure and any documentary evidence to the Complainant and
the Respondent;
make appropriate technological arrangements;
arrange for an electronic recording of the hearing; and
provide other reasonable support services at the Committee’s request.
OEO/AA responsibilities include:
provide the Committee with a copy OEO Report, the attachments (including a copy of
the complaint), and a list of the material witnesses identified in the OEO Report;
provide other reasonable investigatory and support services at the Committee’s request.
Appropriate Sanctioning Administrator responsibilities include:
provide the Committee with a recommended sanction, disciplinary action, or other corrective
measures.
Closed Hearing. Hearings shall be closed to the public.
Advisor. The Complainant and the Respondent may each be accompanied at the hearing
by one advisor of their choice, who may be an attorney and who may participate in
the hearing as provided in this Hearing Process. If a party does not have an advisor
present at the hearing, the University will provide, without fee or charge to that
party, an advisor of the University's choice to conduct cross-examination on behalf
of that party.
Support Person. The Complainant and Respondent may each be accompanied at the hearing
by one Support Person of their choice, who may attend but not participate in the hearing.
Witnesses. The Committee, the Complainant, and the Respondent may request the appearance
of witnesses at the hearing. It is the responsibility of the party or the Committee
calling a particular witness to encourage that witness to attend the hearing.
Documentary Evidence. The Complainant and the Respondent may submit documentary evidence
for consideration by the Committee. The Committee may also request additional documentary
evidence.
Rules of Evidence. The Committee shall not be bound by strict rules of legal evidence
or procedure and may consider any evidence it deems relevant.
Privacy. Committee Chairs and other Committee members are prohibited from discussing
any matter related to the hearing with the parties or the witnesses, or with others
before or after the hearing. Violation of privacy may result in dismissal from the
Committee and/or other corrective action.
Electronic Hearings. Hearings shall be conducted remotely through electronic means,
instead of in- person, when at all possible. These remote hearings shall include audio
and video capabilities which will allow for parties to simultaneously see, hear, and
interact with the Committee, witnesses, and each- other in real-time as if physically
present in the same location.
Recording of Hearings. The hearing, except for deliberations, shall be recorded and
a copy in electronic format shall be made available to either party upon request at
the requesting party’s expense.
Failure of Party to Participate. In the event either party fails to attend the hearing
without prior notice to the Hearing Coordinator and good cause, the Committee may
proceed with the hearing. Neither party is required to participate in the hearing
in order for the hearing to proceed, subject to restrictions in Section (III)(I)(4).
Disruptive Behavior. The Committee has authority to exclude from the hearing any party,
advisor, or other participant whose behavior the Committee finds disruptive after
having provided a warning.
Time Allocation. Each party shall have up to forty- five (45) minutes for personal
and/or opening statements, presentation of evidence and questioning of witnesses,
and concluding remarks. The Committee Chair shall have discretion to grant extensions
of time when necessary.
Role of Office of General Counsel. The Office of General Counsel may provide a staff
attorney to be present at hearings in order to provide guidance to the Committee on
substantive law and procedural matters.
Sanctions and Remedies. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Committee shall determine
the appropriate sanctions and remedies. The Committee will ensure that any sanctions
and remedies are appropriate to end the prohibited conduct, to prevent further violation
of policy and remedy the effects of any violation.
The Committee will review the recommendation submitted by the appropriate administrator
and may call that individual as a witness during the hearing to speak to the reasoning
supporting the recommendation when making their decision. In determining the appropriate
sanction, the Committee shall consider the severity, persistence or pervasiveness
of the misconduct; the egregiousness of the misconduct, including the use of weapons,
drugs, or alcohol, if applicable; the impact of the misconduct on the Complainant;
the impact or implications of the misconduct on the University community, prior misconduct
by the Respondent, including the Respondent's relevant prior disciplinary history;
whether the Respondent has accepted responsibility for the misconduct; the maintenance
of a safe, nondiscriminatory and respectful working and learning environment; and
any other mitigating, aggravating or compelling factors.
If the Respondent is a student, the Office of the Dean of Students will recommend
to the Hearing Committee the disciplinary sanction or other corrective measures. Sanctions
or other corrective measures in cases of Sexual Misconduct are not subject to Policy
6- 400, Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities (“Student Code”) and may only be appealed under Policy 1- 012 and its associated regulations including
this Rule. Possible sanctions include, but are not limited to: fines, restitution,
warning, withholding diploma, organizational sanction, permanent no-contact directives,
educational training, referrals to counseling or behavioral coaching, limitations,
restrictions, or exclusion from campus or campus programs or activities, notation
on the student's transcript consistent with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act, suspension from one semester to five years, dismissal from the University, or
revocation of certificate or degree.
If the Respondent is a staff member, the appropriate University administrator with
supervisory responsibility over the Respondent, in consultation with Human Resources,
will recommend to the Hearing Committee a disciplinary sanction or other corrective
measures. Sanctions or other corrective measures in cases of Sexual Misconduct are
not subject to Policy 5-203, Staff Employee Grievance Procedures, and may only be reviewed and/or appealed under Policy 1-012 and its associated regulations
including this Rule. Possible sanctions include, but are not limited, to: verbal counseling
or warning, extension of probationary period, reassignment, transfer, limitations,
restrictions, or exclusion from campus or campus programs or activities, reduction
in pay, written warning, final written warning, suspension without pay, demotion,
and termination.
If the Respondent is a faculty member, the appropriate University administrator, such
as the faculty member’s Department Chair or Dean, in consultation with the cognizant
Vice President, will recommend to the Hearing Committee the disciplinary sanction
or other corrective action. Possible sanctions include, but are not limited, to: verbal
counseling or warning, limitations, restrictions, or exclusion from campus or campus
programs or activities, written reprimand, suspension without pay and dismissal (termination).
If the Respondent is a vendor/contractor/visitor/patient, possible sanctions or other
corrective measures include limitations, restrictions, or exclusion from all or part(s)
of campus or campus programs or activities and/or ending business relationships with
vendors and contractors.
Remedies. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Committee shall make a determination
regarding any appropriate remedies for the Complainant, including but not limited
to: reinstatement, transfer or reassignment of employees, Supportive Measures, implementing
changes in programs and activities, providing training, or other remedies designed
to restore equal access to University Programs or Activities. The Title IX Coordinator
is responsible for effective implementation of any remedies.
Hearing Committee.
The OEO/AA shall create a standing pool of committee members to hear and be the decision-
makers determining whether allegations of Sexual Misconduct violate University Policy.
The Hearing Committee will be the decision-maker with regard to a finding of responsibility
related to allegations of Sexual Misconduct and any resulting disciplinary sanction
or corrective measures. The pool of eligible Committee members includes the following:
staff employees of the University nominated by the Chief Human Resources Officer and/or
Staff Council and appointed by the University President and/or designee, and who will
serve for a three-year term.
students (graduate and/or undergraduate) nominated pursuant to procedures of Associated
Students of the University of Utah (ASUU) and/or the Office of the Dean of Students,
and appointed by the University President or designee, who will serve a one- year
term; and
faculty members from the Consolidated Hearing Committee pool.
The Committee shall be composed of a three-person panel selected from the pool of
eligible Committee members.
The panel will consist of the Committee Chair, and one Committee member of the same
status as the Complainant (student, staff, or faculty), and one Committee member of
the same status as the Respondent (student, staff, or faculty), subject to the following
exceptions. In the interest of prompt resolution, a Committee may be convened without
student representation during school breaks or other time periods that present student
scheduling difficulties. No more than one student will serve on a Committee.
The Committee Chair will be selected from the pool of eligible committee members who
have previously served on a Committee and will receive specific training relevant
to their duties as Chair.
A Committee member may be disqualified due to bias, conflict of interest, or for other
good cause. Alternates will be appointed as needed.
In order to provide an objective and fair hearing, each Committee shall take precautions
against real or apparent conflicts of interest on the part of Committee members. Committee
members shall recuse themselves in any case in which they have a personal bias or
conflict of interest that would preclude their making a fair and objective decision
and shall avoid any individual communication with a party.
If there is a challenge to the participation of any Committee member, the remaining
Committee members shall hear that dispute and make a final decision about the participation
of that member in the hearing.
Pre-Hearing.
At least fifteen (15) calendar days before the hearing, the Hearing Coordinator shall
notify the Complainant and Respondent in writing, in either an electronic or hard
copy format, of:
the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of the hearing;
the name the Chair and the Committee members;
the names of all witnesses that the Committee intends to call;
any additional documentary evidence that was not included in the OEO Report that the
Committee is requesting; and
of the applicable policies and associated rules and guidelines by which the proceedings
will be governed.
At least ten (10) calendar days before the hearing, the Complainant and the Respondent
must notify the Hearing Coordinator in writing:
of any request that a Committee member be disqualified based on bias or conflict of
interest;
the name and contact information of their selected advisor, if any;
the name and contact information of their selected Support Person, if any;
a list of any witnesses they wish to speak on their behalf as well as contact information
for each witness;
any additional documentary evidence to be submitted to the Committee, including
information the Committee has requested from the parties; and
any other requests for accommodations, including technological accommodations. The
request will be reviewed by Committee Chair and at the Chair's request, the Hearing
Coordinator will make any appropriate accommodations.
At least five (5) calendar days before the hearing, the Hearing Coordinator shall
notify the Complainant and Respondent in writing, in electronic or hard copy format:
of the names of all witnesses requested;
provide copies of all evidence that has not already been provided; and
of any accommodations, including technological accommodations that will be made at
the hearing based upon the request of a party.
Hearing Process.
The OEO Consultant who conducted the investigation may be present at the hearing and
available for questioning.
The Complainant and the Respondent shall each have an opportunity to make a personal
statement. The statement may describe the events that are the subject of the Complaint,
the personal impact of the alleged conduct, the relief sought, and any other relevant
information. In addition to the personal statements by the parties, each party’s advisor
shall have the opportunity to make an opening statement.
The Committee, Complainant, and the Respondent shall have the opportunity to call
witnesses.
The Committee may ask questions of the OEO Consultant, the Complainant, the Respondent,
and any witness. The time of Committee questions and answers shall not count against
either party’s time.
Prior to any party or witness answering a question, the Committee Chair must first
determine whether such question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a
question as not relevant. Only the person to whom a question is directed may answer
(i.e., an advisor shall not be permitted to answer the Committee’s questions on a
party’s behalf).
Questions and evidence about the Complainant’s sexual predispositions or prior sexual
behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence are offered to prove
that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged by the Complainant;
or
if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant’s prior
sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove Consent.
The Committee must permit each party's advisor to ask the OEO Consultant, the Complainant,
the Respondent, any witnesses, and any others providing testimony, all relevant questions
and follow-up questions, including questions challenging credibility. The cross-examination
of any person providing testimony (including the parties, witnesses, and the OEO Consultant)
shall be conducted directly, orally and in real time by the party’s advisor and not
by the party themselves and must be directed through the Committee Chair (not directly).
The Committee cannot draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility
based solely on a party's or witnesses absence from the hearing or refusal to answer
cross- examination or other questions.
The parties may also present other evidence. If a party presents documentary evidence
at the hearing that was not previously provided to the other party and or the Committee
prior to the hearing, the Committee Chair shall make a determination as to whether
to admit such evidence.
Following the presentation of evidence, the Committee will then ask the appropriate
administrator (in cases where the Respondent is a student, a representative from the
Office of the Dean of Students; in cases where the Respondent is a staff employee,
a representative from the Human Resources department and/or the Respondent’s manager;
and, in cases where the Respondent is a faculty member, a representative from the
Office for Faculty and/or the Respondent’s Chair/Dean) to speak to the recommended
sanction or corrective measures.
The Committee will conclude the hearing by providing an opportunity for the parties
to make concluding remarks. The Chair will then adjourn the hearing and begin Committee
deliberations.
Committee deliberations and voting shall be closed sessions from which all other persons
are excluded, except, at the Committee’s request, an advising attorney from the Office
of General Counsel. The advising attorney may remain present for deliberations but
shall have no vote. The Committee in its discretion may take votes openly or by secret
written ballot. A majority vote by the members of the Committee who attended the hearing
shall be required for decisions. The Committee Chair shall be entitled to vote on
all questions. The OEO/AA, including the Director, shall not participate in the Committee’s
deliberations and shall have no vote.
Complaints Involving Patients.
When the Complainant is a patient, Section J above shall not apply and will be addressed
by the procedure outlined at http://healthcare.utah.edu/policies/discrimination.php.
In lieu of a live hearing, the parties may submit a written personal statement, and
submit relevant written questions they wish to be asked of the other party and/or
witnesses no later than three (3) calendar days prior to the designated date. The
Committee will ask those questions (along with any questions the Committee may have
for the parties and/or witnesses) in writing to the other party and/or witnesses and
shall provide each party with the answers and allow for limited follow-up questions
in writing from each party.
The Committee shall then meet on a designated date, no later than five (5) days following
the conclusion of the written question and answer period, to consider the evidence
and deliberate.
Post-Hearing.
Within ten (10) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Committee shall
provide its written determination (“Committee Report”) simultaneously to the parties,
their advisors, if any, and the OEO/AA. The Committee Report shall include:
identification of the allegations potentially constituting Sexual Misconduct;
a description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the Formal Complaint
through the determination;
findings of fact supporting the determination;
conclusions regarding application of the relevant policies to the facts;
a statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation including a determination
regarding responsibility and any disciplinary sanctions the Committee imposes on the
Respondent and whether remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to the
University’s Program or Activity will be provided to the Complainant; and
the procedures and permissible bases for the parties to appeal.
Appeals.
The appealing party (whether student, staff, or faculty) must articulate the applicable
bases for their appeal, which must include at least one of the following:
a procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;
new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination was made,
that could affect the outcome of the matter;
the Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision- maker(s) had a conflict of
interest or bias for or against complainants or Respondents generally or the individual
Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; and
the findings regarding responsibility and or the disciplinary sanction or corrective
measure are arbitrary and capricious.
If a party files an appeal:
The Hearing Coordinator must notify the other party in writing that an appeal has
been filed.
Appeal procedures must be applied equally to both parties.
Each party may provide a written statement in support of, or challenging, the decision
within five (5) days of the notice that an appeal has been filed.
Appeal to the Vice President or their designee.
In cases where the either party is not a faculty member, the Complainant and the Respondent
may each appeal the decision of the Hearing Committee to the cognizant Vice President
or their designee by submitting a request in writing to the Hearing Coordinator within
five (5) calendar days of notice of the Hearing Committee’s decision. Failure to file
a timely written request for appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right to an appeal
under this section. If there is no timely written request for an appeal, the Hearing
Committee’s decision shall become the final and binding decision of the University
(“Final Result”).
The Vice President or their designee shall have available for review all relevant
documentation, including the Committee Report, any other materials presented to the
Committee, the statements or the parties supporting or opposing the appeal, and if
requested by the Vice President or their designee, a recording of the proceedings.
The Vice President or their designee may not base a decision on information not presented
at the hearing unless the nature of that information is fairly communicated to the
parties and a reasonable opportunity to respond is given. The Vice President or their
designee may seek advice from neutral advisors; and
The Vice President or their designee will issue a final and binding decision (“Final
Result”) in writing within ten (10) calendar days of the written request for appeal.
The written decision will describe the result of the appeal and the rationale for
the result. For good cause, the Vice President or their designee may extend the ten-day
period. The Vice President or designee shall simultaneously notify the parties, their
advisors, if any, and the supervisor, Dean, Chair, and any other cognizant University
representatives of the Final Result.
Appeal to the President or their designee.
In cases where either party is a faculty member, the Complainant and the Respondent
may each appeal the decision of the Hearing Committee to the President or their designee
instead of the Vice President, by submitting a request in writing to the Hearing Coordinator
within five (5) calendar days of notice of the Hearing Committee’s decision. Failure
to file a timely written request for appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right
to an appeal under this section. If there is no timely written request for an appeal,
the Hearing Committee’s decision shall become the final and binding decision of the
University (“Final Result”).
On appeal, the President or their designee shall have available for review all relevant
documentation, including the Committee Report, any other materials presented to the
Committee, and if requested by the President, an audio recording of the proceedings.
The President may not base a decision on information not presented at the hearing
unless the nature of that information is fairly communicated to the parties and a
reasonable opportunity to respond is given. The President may seek advice from neutral
advisors.
The President or their designee will issue a final and binding decision (“Final Result”)
in writing within ten (10) calendar days of the written request for appeal. For good
cause, the President or their designee may extend the ten-day period. The Hearing
Coordinator shall concurrently notify the Complainant, the Respondent, and the supervisor,
Dean, Chair, and any other cognizant University representatives of the Final Result.
Training. All materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, investigators, Hearing Committee
members and other decision- makers, including any person who facilitates an Informal
Resolution process related to Sexual Harassment and the grievance process shall be
made publicly available on the OEO/AA website at oeo.utah.edu. Training materials
must not rely on sex/gender stereotypes and must promote impartial investigations
and adjudications of Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment.
Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers and any person who facilitates
an Informal Resolution process will receive training on the definition of Sexual Harassment,
the scope of the University's Programs or Activities, how to conduct an investigation
and grievance process including hearings, appeals, Informal Resolution processes,
and how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue,
conflicts of interest, and bias.
Decision-makers will be trained on how to determine issues of relevance of questions
and evidence, including when questions and evidence about the complainant's sexual
predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, on evidentiary standards
and on hearing procedures.
Investigators will be trained on issues of relevance to create an investigative report
that fairly summarizes relevant evidence.
The Title IX Coordinator, hearing officers and other necessary parties will be trained
on all technology to be used in hearings.

[Interim] Rule 1-012B: Sexual Misconduct Complaint Process Rule.
Revision 3. Effective date: March 16, 2022
Purpose and Scope
The University of Utah (“University”) is committed to providing and fostering an environment
that is safe and free from Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination. Among
other forms of prohibited Discrimination, University Policy prohibits Discrimination
on the basis of sex, which includes all forms of Sexual Misconduct. University Policy
also prohibits Retaliation against individuals for engaging in protected activities,
such as filing a Discrimination Complaint or participating in a Discrimination Complaint
process.
This rule outlines the process the University will use to resolve Complaints of Sexual
Misconduct. This rule is also intended to educate the University community, including
current students, prospective students and employees, about Sexual Misconduct and
about campus resources and processes available to victim-survivors of Sexual Misconduct.
Definitions
For purposes of Policy 1-012 and its associated Rules and Guideline, including this Rule 1-012B, the definitions
of prohibited Discrimination and other words and phrases are provided in Rule 1-012.
Rule
Prevention and Awareness. The University offers comprehensive programing intended to end Dating Violence, Domestic
Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking. The University provides education and training
designed to raise awareness of these issues and engages in efforts that aim to reduce
harm, improve communication skills, foster healthy relationships, improve bystander
intervention skills, and educate the campus community on the definitions of Consent,
Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking through orientations
each semester given to incoming students. The University of Utah Department of Public
Safety (“UDPS”) offers sexual assault education and information programs to University
students and employees upon request. Literature on date rape education, risk reduction,
and University response, as well as educational programs about the same, are available
through various University Student Affairs offices including the Office of Housing
& Residential Education and through the University's Center for Student Wellness.
The University provides primary prevention and awareness programs for incoming students
and new employees, and ongoing programs for students, staff, and faculty which includes:
a statement that the University prohibits the offenses of Domestic Violence, Dating
Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking;
the Utah statutory definitions of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,
and stalking;
the Utah statutory definitions of consent, in reference to sexual activity;
safe and positive options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an
individual to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of Domestic Violence,
Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking;
information on risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior, information
for those who may be at risk to perpetrate harm, and how to avoid potential attacks;
and
definitions of Sexual Misconduct under University Policy, as well as a copy of University
Policy 1-012, Rules 1-012, 1-012A, and 1-012B, and Guidline 1-012.
Initial Response. The first priority of any person who has been subject to Sexual Violence should be
to get to a safe place and then obtain necessary medical treatment and emotional support.
Victim-survivors may seek and receive a medical forensic examination free of charge
from a local hospital emergency department without submitting a police report. The
University strongly encourages victim-survivors to report all incidents of Sexual
Misconduct as soon as possible. Time is a critical factor for evidence collection
and preservation.
Role of Law Enforcement. The victim-survivor of an incident of Sexual Violence (rape,
fondling, incest, statutory rape), Dating Violence, Domestic Violence and Stalking
is encouraged, but not required, to report the incident directly to the University
Department of Public Safety (“UDPS”) or the local law enforcement entity for the jurisdiction
in which the incident took place.
Alternatively, or in conjunction with a report to law enforcement, victim-survivors
may make a report to the Office of Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (OEO/AA)
(see Section (III)(C)), the Office of the Dean of Students, a Housing & Residential
Education representative, and/or another University representative. Filing a police
report will not obligate the victim-survivor to pursue a complaint through the criminal
process. Filing a police report will:
ensure the victim-survivor receives appropriate medical treatment, including a medical
forensic exam at no expense;
provides the opportunity for collection of evidence helpful in prosecution, which
cannot be obtained later (ideally, a victim-survivor of Sexual Violence should not
wash, use the toilet, or change clothing prior to a medical forensic exam); and
provide the victim-survivor with available resources, including supportive resources.
A victim-survivor may request any University representative to assist them in notifying
law enforcement authorities about an incident of Sexual Violence (rape, fondling,
incest, statutory rape) Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking and any other
behavior that may constitute a crime.
When a victim-survivor contacts the UDPS, the UDPS will notify the Title IX Coordinator,
the OEO/AA, and the Office of the Dean of Students (if related to a student). A victim-
survivor may choose for an investigation to be pursued either through the criminal
justice system, through this rule, or both. Victim-survivors may also choose not to
proceed in the criminal justice system or under this rule (subject to Section (III)(D)
of this rule). A representative from the Center for Student Wellness Victim-Survivor
Advocacy program, Chief Safety Office Community Services Division, UDPS, the Office
of the Dean of Students, the Title IX Coordinator, and/or the OEO/AA will guide the
victim-survivor through the available options.
Where applicable, UDPS will enforce orders of protection, no contact orders, restraining
orders, civil stalking injunctions, or similar lawful orders issued by a criminal,
civil, or tribal court.
Role of the OEO/AA. The OEO/AA is the University department charged with responding to reports and investigating
Formal Complaints of Discrimination, including Sexual Misconduct.
The Director of the OEO/AA serves as the University’s Title IX Coordinator.
Sherrie Hayashi Director, Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Title
IX/ADA/Section 504 Coordinator University of Utah 383 University Street, Level 1,
Suite OEO, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 Phone: (801) 581-8365 Fax: (801) 585-5746 oeo@utah.edu www.oeo.utah.edu
Upon receipt of a report of alleged Sexual Misconduct, Complainants will promptly
receive information from the Title IX Coordinator that:
provides the Complainant with written notification of and assist the Complainant in
accessing counseling, mental health and healthcare, victim advocacy, legal, academic
support, and other resources available in the community and on-campus;
offers and discusses Supportive Measures with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint;
considers the Complainant's wishes with respect to Supportive Measures;
explains the process for filing a Formal Complaint; and
informs the Complainant of the right to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement
and provide the Complainant with assistance, if requested.
Confidentiality.1 The University encourages victim-survivors of Sexual Misconduct to talk to someone
about what happened. Different employees on campus have different requirements to
maintain a victim- survivor’s confidentiality.
Completely Confidential. Professional and pastoral counselors are completely confidential,
except any reporting required by state and federal law, and do not report any information
disclosed by a Complainant to the University or to the OEO/AA.
Limited Confidentiality. Nonprofessional counselors and advocates (e.g., individuals
who are not professional counselors and who work or volunteer, including front desk staff
and students, in the University Counseling Center, Center for Student Wellness, Center
for Student Wellness Victim-Survivor Advocacy program, Ombuds Office, or counseling
services in the Women’s Resource Center, must report only general information about
crimes required to be reported under the Clery Act to the Chief Safety Office — such
as the nature, date, time, and general location of the incident—in a way that does
not identify the individuals involved.
Clery Reporting Requirements. Under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the
Clery Act, the University is required to complete publicly available record- keeping
on crimes required to be reported by the Clery Act in accordance with federal law,
but will not disclose identifying information. The University will maintain as confidential
any Protective Measures provided to the victim-survivor, to the extent that maintaining
such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the institution to provide the
Protective Measures.
Confidential Resources. The following are resources are confidential. *These offices must report general information about crimes reportable under the
Clery Act to the Chief Safety Office in a way that does not identify the individuals involved, such as the nature, date, time, and general location of
the incident. This information is required to be included in the University’s Annual
Security Report under the Clery Act, and in rare circumstances may result in the issuance
of a timely warning or other University obligations under Clery/VAWA.

Reporting to Mandatory Reporters.
A Mandatory Reporter must promptly report to the Title IX Coordinator all relevant
details about the alleged Sexual Misconduct shared by a Complainant—including the
names of the Complainant and alleged Respondent(s), any witnesses, and any other relevant
facts, including the date, time and specific location of the alleged incident.
Before a Complainant reveals any information to a Mandatory Reporter, the Mandatory
Reporter should ensure that the Complainant understands the Mandatory Reporter's reporting
obligations. If the Complainant wants to maintain confidentiality, the Mandatory Reporter
should direct the Complainant to confidential resources.
If the Complainant wants to tell the Mandatory Reporter what happened but also requests
confidentiality, requests that no investigation occur, or requests that no action
be taken against the Respondent, the Mandatory Reporter should tell the Complainant
that the University will consider the request, but cannot guarantee that the University
will be able to honor it.
Requests for Confidentiality. If a Complainant discloses an incident to a Mandatory Reporter but wishes to maintain
confidentiality, or requests that no investigation into a particular incident be conducted
or disciplinary action taken, the University must weigh that request against the University’s
obligation to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment for all students, including
the Complainant.
The University has designated the Title IX Coordinator to evaluate requests for allegations
of Sexual Misconduct.
If the University determines that it cannot maintain a Complainant’s confidentiality,
the University will inform the Complainant prior to starting an investigation and
will, to the extent possible, only share information with people responsible for handling
the University’s response.
Supportive Measures. When the University receives information about alleged Sexual Misconduct, an appropriate
University representative (such as the Dean of Students, cognizant supervisor, or
Human Resources (HR) representative) may offer Supportive Measures to either or both
parties which will generally remain in effect throughout and potentially beyond the
duration of the University investigation. Supportive Measures will be offered under
the auspices of the Title IX Coordinator; University representatives should consult
with the Title IX Coordinator in offering any Supportive Measures. The University
will offer Supportive Measures if they are reasonably available, regardless of whether
the Complainant chooses to file a complaint with the OEO/AA or with law enforcement.
Because the University is under a continuing obligation to address the issue of Sexual
Misconduct campus-wide, reports of Sexual Misconduct (including non-identifying reports)
will also prompt the University to consider broader remedial action.
Amnesty. An individual who makes a good faith report of Sexual Harassment or Sexual Misconduct
that was directed at them or another person will not be sanctioned for a violation
related to the use of drugs or alcohol that is related to the report.
Non-Disclosure of Information. Parties will be provided evidence obtained by the OEO/AA as part of the investigation
that is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint (the "Evidence");
the parties and party advisors must keep all such evidence strictly confidential and
use such evidence solely for the purposes of participating in the Sexual Misconduct
investigation and grievance process. Parties who disseminate or use such evidence
for any other purpose may be subject to discipline.
OEO/AA Investigation. In cases of Sexual Misconduct, the OEO/AA will begin an investigation upon acceptance
of a Formal Complaint. The University will not require a Complainant to participate
in any investigation or disciplinary proceeding; however, failure to participate may
limit the University’s ability to respond.
Upon acceptance of a Formal Complaint, the OEO/AA will provide written notice:
to the appropriate University administrator, which may include the supervisor, Chair,
Dean, and/or cognizant Vice President with responsibility over the Respondent and
any others with a legitimate business need.
If the Respondent is a student, the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Office
of Dean of Students will also be notified.
If the Respondent is a Vice President, another Vice President will be selected as
the cognizant Vice President for purposes of this rule.
to the Complainant and the Respondent providing:
the applicable policies and associated rules by which the proceedings will be governed;
sufficient details of the allegations including the identities of the parties involved,
the date and location of the alleged incident(s), and the conduct allegedly constituting
a violation of University Policy, if known;
a statement that each party will have an equal opportunity to submit and review evidence
throughout the investigation;
a statement that the Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct
until a determination is made at the conclusion of the grievance process;
a statement informing the Complainant and Respondent that they may have one advisor
of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be an attorney and one Support
Person of their choice; and
that Rule 1-012(III)(D)(10) prohibits knowingly making false statements or knowingly
submitting false statements during the grievance process.
If, during the course of the investigation, allegations arise about the Complainant
or Respondent that were not included in the initial notice, the OEO/AA will provide
notice of the additional allegations and provide the Respondent with an opportunity
to respond.
The Respondent shall be afforded a full opportunity to respond to the allegations
contained in the Complaint. Failure to respond or participate in an interview by the
Respondent or a witness will not prevent the completion of the investigation.
The OEO/AA will not draw an inference about the determination of responsibility based
solely on a party’s or witness’s decision not to participate in the investigative
or hearing process; however, evidence for review will be limited to that provided
by parties and witnesses who participate in the investigation.
The OEO/AA shall interview the Complainant, the Respondent, and may interview any
other person with relevant information. The OEO/AA will objectively review all relevant
information, including that which is submitted by the parties.
The Complainant and the Respondent may each be accompanied at any meetings or interviews
with the OEO/AA by one advisor who may be, but does not have to be, an attorney. During
the investigation, the advisor may only advise the Complainant or Respondent and may
not actively participate. Prior to the hearing, any advisor is at the Complainant
or Respondent’s own expense.
The Complainant and the Respondent may each be accompanied at any meetings or interviews
by one Support Person. The Support Person's role is to provide support to the Complainant
or Respondent and cannot speak on behalf of the party.
At the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO/AA shall issue the draft of its investigative
report (“OEO Draft”) simultaneously to the parties and their advisors, if any, in
an electronic or hard copy format. The OEO Draft shall include:
a summary of the relevant evidence;
an analysis of whether the evidence, evaluated under a Preponderance of the Evidence
standard, supports a recommendation that Sexual Misconduct occurred;
any mitigating or aggravating factors; and
any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the
allegations raised in the Formal Complaint.
To protect the privacy of witnesses and all parties involved, and pursuant to Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and other state and federal privacy laws,
names and other personally identifiable information may be redacted from the copies
of the OEO Draft Report and the OEO Report that are provided to the Complainant and
Respondent.
Both parties shall have ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the OEO Draft Report
to submit written comments and any additional documents and/or evidence to the OEO/AA.
If information from either party raises new issues or allegations, the OEO/AA may
conduct additional investigation.
At the conclusion of the OEO/AA’s investigation, the OEO/AA shall issue a final investigative
report (“OEO Report”) simultaneously to the parties and their advisors, if any, and
the appropriate administrator with responsibility over the Respondent in an electronic
or hard copy format. The OEO Report shall include:
a summary of the relevant evidence;
an analysis of whether the evidence, evaluated under a Preponderance of the Evidence
standard, supports a recommendation that Sexual Misconduct occurred;
any mitigating or aggravating factors; and
any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the
allegations raised in the Formal Complaint.
Upon determining a recommended sanction, the appropriate administrator will provide
written notice of a recommended sanction to the parties, to the OEO/AA, and the Hearing
Coordinator, and to the cognizant Vice President with responsibility over the Respondent
and any others with a legitimate business need, contemporaneous with the OEO/AA issuing
the OEO Report.
At the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO/AA shall convene a Hearing Committee
(“Committee”). This Committee shall serve as the decision-maker with regard to the
allegations of Sexual Misconduct, any associated disciplinary sanction or other corrective
measures, and any remedies for the Complainant. The Committee shall make an independent
judgment in objectively evaluating relevant evidence to reach a determination regarding
responsibility, independent from the recommendation from the investigator or the appropriate
administrator.
Hearing Process.
Hearings should take place as soon as practicable, but should be no less than fifteen
(15) and no more than forty (40) calendar days from the issuance of the OEO Report.
Although the OEO/AA Hearing Coordinator may endeavor to find a hearing date that will
be convenient for all the parties involved, the Hearing Coordinator and Committee
Chair have the final authority for determining the date of the hearing.
General Provisions for Hearings.
A Hearing Coordinator may facilitate the work of the Committee. Hearing Coordinator
responsibilities include:

Sanctions and Remedies. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Committee shall determine
the appropriate sanctions and remedies. The Committee will ensure that any sanctions
and remedies are appropriate to end the prohibited conduct, to prevent further violation
of policy and remedy the effects of any violation.
The Committee will review the recommendation submitted by the appropriate administrator
and may call that individual as a witness during the hearing to speak to the reasoning
supporting the recommendation when making their decision. In determining the appropriate
sanction, the Committee shall consider the severity, persistence or pervasiveness
of the misconduct; the egregiousness of the misconduct, including the use of weapons,
drugs, or alcohol, if applicable; the impact of the misconduct on the Complainant;
the impact or implications of the misconduct on the University community, prior misconduct
by the Respondent, including the Respondent's relevant prior disciplinary history;
whether the Respondent has accepted responsibility for the misconduct; the maintenance
of a safe, nondiscriminatory and respectful working and learning environment; and
any other mitigating, aggravating or compelling factors.
If the Respondent is a student, the Office of the Dean of Students will recommend
to the Hearing Committee the disciplinary sanction or other corrective measures. Sanctions
or other corrective measures in cases of Sexual Misconduct are not subject to Policy
6- 400, Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities (“Student Code”) and may only be appealed under Policy 1- 012 and its associated regulations including
this Rule. Possible sanctions include, but are not limited to: fines, restitution,

counseling or warning, limitations, restrictions, or exclusion from campus or campus
programs or activities, written reprimand, suspension without pay and dismissal (termination).
If the Respondent is a vendor/contractor/visitor/patient, possible sanctions or other
corrective measures include limitations, restrictions, or exclusion from all or part(s)
of campus or campus programs or activities and/or ending business relationships with
vendors and contractors.
Remedies. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Committee shall make a determination
regarding any appropriate remedies for the Complainant, including but not limited
to: reinstatement, transfer or reassignment of employees, Supportive Measures, implementing
changes in programs and activities, providing training, or other remedies designed
to restore equal access to University Programs or Activities. The Title IX Coordinator
is responsible for effective implementation of any remedies.
Hearing Committee.
The OEO/AA shall create a standing pool of committee members to hear and be the decision-
makers determining whether allegations of Sexual Misconduct violate University Policy.
The Hearing Committee will be the decision-maker with regard to a finding of responsibility
related to allegations of Sexual Misconduct and any resulting disciplinary sanction
or corrective measures. The pool of eligible Committee members includes the following:
staff employees of the University nominated by the Chief Human Resources Officer and/or
Staff Council and appointed by the University President and/or designee, and who will
serve for a three-year term.
students (graduate and/or undergraduate) nominated pursuant to procedures of Associated
Students of the University of Utah (ASUU) and/or the Office of the Dean of Students,
and appointed by the University President or designee, who will serve a one- year
term; and
faculty members from the Consolidated Hearing Committee pool.
The Committee shall be composed of a three-person panel selected from the pool of
eligible Committee members.
The panel will consist of the Committee Chair, and one Committee member of the same
status as the Complainant (student, staff, or faculty), and one Committee member of
the same status as the Respondent (student, staff, or faculty), subject to the following
exceptions. In the interest of prompt resolution, a Committee may be convened without
student representation during school breaks or other time periods that present student
scheduling difficulties. No more than one student will serve on a Committee.
The Committee Chair will be selected from the pool of eligible committee members who
have previously served on a Committee and will receive specific training relevant
to their duties as Chair.
A Committee member may be disqualified due to bias, conflict of interest, or for other
good cause. Alternates will be appointed as needed.
In order to provide an objective and fair hearing, each Committee shall take precautions
against real or apparent conflicts of interest on the part of Committee members. Committee
members shall recuse themselves in any case in which they have a personal bias or
conflict of interest that would preclude their making a fair and objective decision
and shall avoid any individual communication with a party.
If there is a challenge to the participation of any Committee member, the remaining
Committee members shall hear that dispute and make a final decision about the participation
of that member in the hearing.
Pre-Hearing.
At least fifteen (15) calendar days before the hearing, the Hearing Coordinator shall
notify the Complainant and Respondent in writing, in either an electronic or hard
copy format, of:
the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of the hearing;
the name the Chair and the Committee members;
the names of all witnesses that the Committee intends to call;
any additional documentary evidence that was not included in the OEO Report that the
Committee is requesting; and
of the applicable policies and associated rules and guidelines by which the proceedings
will be governed.
At least ten (10) calendar days before the hearing, the Complainant and the Respondent
must notify the Hearing Coordinator in writing:
of any request that a Committee member be disqualified based on bias or conflict of
interest;
the name and contact information of their selected advisor, if any;
the name and contact information of their selected Support Person, if any;
a list of any witnesses they wish to speak on their behalf as well as contact information
for each witness;
any additional documentary evidence to be submitted to the Committee, including
information the Committee has requested from the parties; and
any other requests for accommodations, including technological accommodations. The
request will be reviewed by Committee Chair and at the Chair's request, the Hearing
Coordinator will make any appropriate accommodations.
At least five (5) calendar days before the hearing, the Hearing Coordinator shall
notify the Complainant and Respondent in writing, in electronic or hard copy format:
of the names of all witnesses requested;
provide copies of all evidence that has not already been provided; and
of any accommodations, including technological accommodations that will be made at
the hearing based upon the request of a party.
Hearing Process.
The OEO Consultant who conducted the investigation may be present at the hearing and
available for questioning.
The Complainant and the Respondent shall each have an opportunity to make a personal
statement. The statement may describe the events that are the subject of the Complaint,
the personal impact of the alleged conduct, the relief sought, and any other relevant
information. In addition to the personal statements by the parties, each party’s advisor
shall have the opportunity to make an opening statement.
The Committee, Complainant, and the Respondent shall have the opportunity to call
witnesses.
The Committee may ask questions of the OEO Consultant, the Complainant, the Respondent,
and any witness. The time of Committee questions and answers shall not count against
either party’s time.
Prior to any party or witness answering a question, the Committee Chair must first
determine whether such question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a
question as not relevant. Only the person to whom a question is directed may answer
(i.e., an advisor shall not be permitted to answer the Committee’s questions on a
party’s behalf).
Questions and evidence about the Complainant’s sexual predispositions or prior sexual
behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence are offered to prove
that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged by the Complainant;
or
if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant’s prior
sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove Consent.
The Committee must permit each party's advisor to ask the OEO Consultant, the Complainant,
the Respondent, any witnesses, and any others providing testimony, all relevant questions
and follow-up questions, including questions challenging credibility. The cross-examination
of any person providing testimony (including the parties, witnesses, and the OEO Consultant)
shall be conducted directly, orally and in real time by the party’s advisor and not
by the party themselves and must be directed through the Committee Chair (not directly).
The Committee cannot draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility
based solely on a party's or witnesses absence from the hearing or refusal to answer
cross- examination or other questions.
The parties may also present other evidence. If a party presents documentary evidence
at the hearing that was not previously provided to the other party and or the Committee
prior to the hearing, the Committee Chair shall make a determination as to whether
to admit such evidence.
Following the presentation of evidence, the Committee will then ask the appropriate
administrator (in cases where the Respondent is a student, a representative from the
Office of the Dean of Students; in cases where the Respondent is a staff employee,
a representative from the Human Resources department and/or the Respondent’s manager;
and, in cases where the Respondent is a faculty member, a representative from the
Office for Faculty and/or the Respondent’s Chair/Dean) to speak to the recommended
sanction or corrective measures.
The Committee will conclude the hearing by providing an opportunity for the parties
to make concluding remarks. The Chair will then adjourn the hearing and begin Committee
deliberations.
Committee deliberations and voting shall be closed sessions from which all other persons
are excluded, except, at the Committee’s request, an advising attorney from the Office
of General Counsel. The advising attorney may remain present for deliberations but
shall have no vote. The Committee in its discretion may take votes openly or by secret
written ballot. A majority vote by the members of the Committee who attended the hearing
shall be required for decisions. The Committee Chair shall be entitled to vote on
all questions. The OEO/AA, including the Director, shall not participate in the Committee’s
deliberations and shall have no vote.
Complaints Involving Patients.
When the Complainant is a patient, Section J above shall not apply and will be addressed
by the procedure outlined at http://healthcare.utah.edu/policies/discrimination.php.
In lieu of a live hearing, the parties may submit a written personal statement, and
submit relevant written questions they wish to be asked of the other party and/or
witnesses no later than three (3) calendar days prior to the designated date. The
Committee will ask those questions (along with any questions the Committee may have
for the parties and/or witnesses) in writing to the other party and/or witnesses and
shall provide each party with the answers and allow for limited follow-up questions
in writing from each party.
The Committee shall then meet on a designated date, no later than five (5) days following
the conclusion of the written question and answer period, to consider the evidence
and deliberate.
Post-Hearing.
Within ten (10) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Committee shall
provide its written determination (“Committee Report”) simultaneously to the parties,
their advisors, if any, and the OEO/AA. The Committee Report shall include:
identification of the allegations potentially constituting Sexual Misconduct;
a description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the Formal Complaint
through the determination;
findings of fact supporting the determination;
conclusions regarding application of the relevant policies to the facts;
a statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation including a determination
regarding responsibility and any disciplinary sanctions the Committee imposes on the
Respondent and whether remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to the
University’s Program or Activity will be provided to the Complainant; and
the procedures and permissible bases for the parties to appeal.
Appeals.
The appealing party (whether student, staff, or faculty) must articulate the applicable
bases for their appeal, which must include at least one of the following:
a procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;
new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination was made,
that could affect the outcome of the matter;
the Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision- maker(s) had a conflict of
interest or bias for or against complainants or Respondents generally or the individual
Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; and
the findings regarding responsibility and or the disciplinary sanction or corrective
measure are arbitrary and capricious.
If a party files an appeal:
The Hearing Coordinator must notify the other party in writing that an appeal has
been filed.
Appeal procedures must be applied equally to both parties.
Each party may provide a written statement in support of, or challenging, the decision
within five (5) days of the notice that an appeal has been filed.
Appeal to the Vice President or their designee.
In cases where the either party is not a faculty member, the Complainant and the Respondent
may each appeal the decision of the Hearing Committee to the cognizant Vice President
or their designee by submitting a request in writing to the Hearing Coordinator within
five (5) calendar days of notice of the Hearing Committee’s decision. Failure to file
a timely written request for appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right to an appeal
under this section. If there is no timely written request for an appeal, the Hearing
Committee’s decision shall become the final and binding decision of the University
(“Final Result”).
The Vice President or their designee shall have available for review all relevant
documentation, including the Committee Report, any other materials presented to the
Committee, the statements or the parties supporting or opposing the appeal, and if
requested by the Vice President or their designee, a recording of the proceedings.
The Vice President or their designee may not base a decision on information not presented
at the hearing unless the nature of that information is fairly communicated to the
parties and a reasonable opportunity to respond is given. The Vice President or their
designee may seek advice from neutral advisors; and
The Vice President or their designee will issue a final and binding decision (“Final
Result”) in writing within ten (10) calendar days of the written request for appeal.
The written decision will describe the result of the appeal and the rationale for
the result. For good cause, the Vice President or their designee may extend the ten-day
period. The Vice President or designee shall simultaneously notify the parties, their
advisors, if any, and the supervisor, Dean, Chair, and any other cognizant University
representatives of the Final Result.
Appeal to the President or their designee.
In cases where either party is a faculty member, the Complainant and the Respondent
may each appeal the decision of the Hearing Committee to the President or their designee
instead of the Vice President, by submitting a request in writing to the Hearing Coordinator
within five (5) calendar days of notice of the Hearing Committee’s decision. Failure
to file a timely written request for appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right
to an appeal under this section. If there is no timely written request for an appeal,
the Hearing Committee’s decision shall become the final and binding decision of the
University (“Final Result”).
On appeal, the President or their designee shall have available for review all relevant
documentation, including the Committee Report, any other materials presented to the
Committee, and if requested by the President, an audio recording of the proceedings.
The President may not base a decision on information not presented at the hearing
unless the nature of that information is fairly communicated to the parties and a
reasonable opportunity to respond is given. The President may seek advice from neutral
advisors.
The President or their designee will issue a final and binding decision (“Final Result”)
in writing within ten (10) calendar days of the written request for appeal. For good
cause, the President or their designee may extend the ten-day period. The Hearing
Coordinator shall concurrently notify the Complainant, the Respondent, and the supervisor,
Dean, Chair, and any other cognizant University representatives of the Final Result.
Training. All materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, investigators, Hearing Committee
members and other decision- makers, including any person who facilitates an Informal
Resolution process related to Sexual Harassment and the grievance process shall be
made publicly available on the OEO/AA website at oeo.utah.edu. Training materials
must not rely on sex/gender stereotypes and must promote impartial investigations
and adjudications of Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment.
Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers and any person who facilitates
an Informal Resolution process will receive training on the definition of Sexual Harassment,
the scope of the University's Programs or Activities, how to conduct an investigation
and grievance process including hearings, appeals, Informal Resolution processes,
and how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue,
conflicts of interest, and bias.
Decision-makers will be trained on how to determine issues of relevance of questions
and evidence, including when questions and evidence about the complainant's sexual
predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, on evidentiary standards
and on hearing procedures.
Investigators will be trained on issues of relevance to create an investigative report
that fairly summarizes relevant evidence.
The Title IX Coordinator, hearing officers and other necessary parties will be trained
on all technology to be used in hearings.

Nondiscrimination & Accessibility Statement
The University of Utah does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, color,
religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, age, disability,
sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information or protected
veteran’s status, in employment, treatment, admission, access to educational programs
and activities, or other University benefits or services.
The University does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the education program
or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX and 34 CFR part 106.  The requirement

Privacy Statement
The University of Utah has created this statement to demonstrate our firm commitment
to your privacy. This document explains how we gather, use, and protect your information.
We Don't Sell Your Contact Information
While using this site, you may choose to submit personal information through email
or online forms. We will use this information to process your requests. But we will
not intentionally sell, share, or distribute your personal information to third parties,
except as required by law or university policy.
EU General Data Protection Regulation
Please be aware of the University’s GDPR Privacy Notice that supplements this Privacy
Statement. The GDPR Privacy Notice applies generally to the provision of personal
information by individuals in the European Economic Area. The GDPR Privacy Notice
explains how we meet our obligations under the European Union General Data Protection
Regulation with respect to such information. The GDPR Privacy Notice can be found
at https://www.utah.edu/privacy/gdpr.php.
Statistical Logs Kept
The University uses reporting programs to collect data about visitor traffic to our
site. We do not attempt to personally identify visitors. Instead we collect data to
analyze in aggregate to determine trends and improve our sites. Here are some examples
of the types of data we routinely collect:
Internet address of computer
Browser type
Referring web page
Date, time & duration of visit
Cookies Used to Preserve Data
Some U sites require the use of cookies (bits of data passed by your browser to our
site). For instance, the My.Utah.edu portal uses cookies (active only during your
session) to remember password and menu settings. You are not required to use My.Utah.edu;
this tool is provided for your convenience. If you prefer not to receive cookies,
you can turn them off in your browser or set your browser to ask you before accepting
new cookies.
Security Programs Running
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to assist in maintaining data security,
and to assist in correctly using the information we collect online. We do not intentionally
release personal information gleaned from these programs to others, except as required
by law.
Security Precautions You Should Take
Although we make every effort to secure our networks, the University cannot guarantee
privacy of online communications. Use discretion in providing information in online
classes, chatrooms, or other open forums on the Web. If you use My.Utah.edu to access
personal records, be sure to "lock up" when you leave by exiting the site AND closing
your browser. Otherwise, the next person to use the computer may see your information.
Alternate Ways to Submit Information
You have a choice about whether to provide personal information online. For other
options, contact the site manager and learn how you can provide information by phone,
mail, fax or in person.
Other Sites Have Different Policies
This site contains links to other independently managed U sites. Some may use information
for purposes other than stated above; be sure to read their separate privacy statements.
U sites also contain links to sites outside the university; these sites may have their
own privacy statement--or none at all. We urge you to exercise caution when providing
personal data to any site. Check their policies and contact them if you have questions.
Protecting Children's Privacy
We encourage parents to explore our website with their children. If we learn that
a child under age 13 has provided personally identifiable information to our sites,
we will promptly remove this from our files. For more on children's privacy rights,
read about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act at the FTC's website.
Changing Your Information
Here's how to review or change your personal profile information (address, home phone,
e-mail):
On the Web – Log in to the Campus Information Services and click your address, phone, or email to edit.
In Person – Visit Registration Service Window #13 on the 2nd floor of the Student Services Building.
