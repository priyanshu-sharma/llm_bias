Treating someone differently based on a protected class\xc2\xa0violates University policy. A protected class is a group of people protected against\ndiscrimination by University policy or by state and federal law.\nProtected Classes\nicon\xc2\xa0Color\xc2\xa0icon\xc2\xa0Raceicon\xc2\xa0Ethnicityicon\xc2\xa0National Originicon\xc2\xa0Ageicon\xc2\xa0Religionicon\xc2\xa0Disabilityicon\xc2\xa0Veteran Statusicon\xc2\xa0Pregnancy\xc2\xa0icon\xc2\xa0Sexicon\xc2\xa0Sexual Orientationicon\xc2\xa0Gender Identityicon\xc2\xa0Gender Expressionicon\xc2\xa0Genetic Information\nNot all discrimination violates law or policy. One can be subject to unfair treatment\nthat does not violate University policy or state or federal law. An example would\nbe being treated unfairly because someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like you or because of your political\naffiliations.\nDiscriminatory Harassment\nWhat is Discriminatory Harassment?\nThe University\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscrimination policy applies broadly to students, employees,\nand visitors. Hostile environment is a commonly used term but from a legal and policy\nperspective, a hostile environment is a form of discriminatory harassment.\nHarassment means unwelcome or offensive conduct which has the purpose or effect of\ninterfering with an individuals\xe2\x80\x99 work or academic environment or creating an intimidating\nhostile, offensive or otherwise working or learning environment based upon a person\xe2\x80\x99s\nrace, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,\ngender identity, gender expression, or protected veteran\xe2\x80\x99s status. The University\xe2\x80\x99s\nOffice of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA) is responsible for the\nUniversity\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscrimination policies.\nMany people have heard the term \xe2\x80\x9chostile environment\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of sexual harassment\nbut a \xe2\x80\x9chostile environment\xe2\x80\x9d can also include harassment because of race, color, national\norigin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and\nprotected veteran\xe2\x80\x99s status. For harassment not related to discrimination, contact\nHuman Resources.\nWhat constitutes a hostile environment? What are the range of scenarios that people\nmight experience?\nA hostile environment can be created in many ways. Verbal comments, text messages,\npictures, graphics, graffiti and physical conduct can create a hostile environment.\nThis might look like racial slurs, comments about a person\xe2\x80\x99s national origin, or behavior\nor words that mock, demean, put down, disparage, threaten or ridicule others based\nupon race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,\ngender identity/expression and protected veteran\xe2\x80\x99s status.\nAn isolated statement, even if rude and offensive, generally does not constitute a\nhostile environment. Occasional insensitive and off-hand comments, even if inappropriate\nor unprofessional, will generally not create a hostile environment. The focus is whether\nthe behavior, as a whole, affecting a person\xe2\x80\x99s education or working environment. In order to interfere with a person\xe2\x80\x99s work or educational environment, generally\nthe conduct must be severe, recurring and pervasive so that it interferes with your\nability to fulfill your work and academic pursuits.\nAlthough an occasional comment may not constitute a violation of the University\xe2\x80\x99s\nnondiscrimination policy, other provisions of University policy governing student\nand employee conduct may apply. It is important to mention that the University, in\nterms of student, visitor, and employee conduct, has an interest in preventing discrimination\nand harassment. For example, if a department has an employee who tells an inappropriate\njoke then other employees begin to participate in similar types of comments, believing\nthat such behavior is condoned, the workplace can then develop into a hostile environment\nfor those that find such conduct unwelcome and offensive.\nIf someone feels like they are experiencing a hostile environment, what options are\nopen to them to deal with the situation?\nThe first step is to tell the individual that their comments are unwelcome and unwanted.\nSometimes this may be difficult but once you have made it clear that their comments\nare not welcome, the individual has clearly been notified that you find their behavior\nunwelcome and offensive. Once the individual clearly understands the behavior isn\xe2\x80\x99t\nwelcome yet continues to engage in similar behavior, disciplinary action may be appropriate.\nThere are many options on the University campus that can assist you in addressing\nthe unwanted and unwelcome behavior. The Office of the Dean of Students, Human Resources, and the Office of Equal Opportunity are all avenues that can assist you in addressing\nthe unwelcome behavior.\nHow are issues like these handled to protect the person dealing with hostility while\nalso being fair to the Respondent?\nThe Office of Equal Opportunity is neutral and impartial whose purpose in an investigation\nis to determine the facts. Both parties are provided an opportunity to provide their\nside of the story. Obtaining both the perspective of the person dealing with the hostility\nas well as the person alleged to have engaged in the behavior is important in terms\nof treating both parties fairly. Although both parties are given an opportunity to\nprovide their side of the story, it is important to remember that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter\nwhether the behavior was intended to hurt the other individual. An investigation by\nthe Office of Equal Opportunity would look at whether a reasonable person would take\noffense to the unwanted or unwelcome behavior.\nRETALIATION\nUniversity policy prohibits retaliation against an individual for having made a complaint,\ntestified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, hearing, or\nproceeding under the University\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscrimination policies or for interfering with\nthe rights of individuals under the University\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscrimination policies.\nExamples of retaliation include:\ndemoting, disciplining, or harassing an employee because the employee files or reports\ndiscrimination or sexual misconduct to OEO/AA\ninterfering with witnesses or others who may be interviewed as part of an investigation\ngiving a lower grade because a student does not accede to sexual advances\nIf you believe you have experienced discriminatory conduct, including sexual misconduct,\nor retaliation, you may file a\xc2\xa0complaint\xc2\xa0with our office.\nOffice of Equal Opportunity,\xc2\xa0 Affirmative Action, and Title IX\n383 South University Street, Level 1 OEO SuiteSalt Lake City, UT 84112801-581-8365\nStay in Touch\nFind Us\nContact Us\nWebmaster\nQuick Links\nA-Z Index\nCampus Directory\nCampus Map\nShuttle Tracker\nCIS\nUMail\n@ The U\n\xc2\xa9 2023 The University of Utah\nIndigenous Land Acknowledgment\nNondiscrimination & Accessibility\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nCredits & Attributions\nMedia Contacts\nFacebook\nInstagram\nYoutube\nLast Updated: 4/19/23'"];
