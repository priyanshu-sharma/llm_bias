The institution\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary process is designed to:\nDETERMINE IF INSTITUTIONAL POLICY HAS BEEN VIOLATED\nPROVIDE RESOLUTIONS THAT EDUCATE RESPONDENTS\nREMEDY THE EFFECTS OF MISCONDUCT\nPROTECT INDIVIDUALS IN THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY FROM FURTHER\nMISCONDUCT\nOEO/Title IX conducts investigations into allegations of discrimination or sexual misconduct.\xc2\xa0 When a violation of university policy has occurred, sanctions may be implemented by the appropriate sanctioning body.\nIncidents reported to OEO/Title IX are generally not reported to the police (exceptions may occur when circumstances raise concerns of safety of others, including the broader campus community). Incidents reported to the University of Utah police are reported to OEO/Title IX.\nCriminal and university administrative processes are independent of one another and may result in different outcomes and resolutions.\nGENERAL OEO INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS\nWhen an incident of discrimination or sexual misconduct occurs, it should be reported to OEO/Title IX. Once the office receives information about an incident, OEO/Title IX begins to review and determine how to respond to the reported incident:\nREPORT OF DISCRIMINATION OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT\nWhen OEO/Title IX becomes aware of an incident of discrimination or sexual misconduct, the office immediately begins to explore the issue further to determine the appropriate steps to take based upon the information reported.\nPROVIDE SUPPORTIVE MEASURES\nOEO/Title IX immediately connects individuals with information about supportive measures, resources and information about filing options, including how to file a formal complaint with OEO/AA and law enforcement, if applicable.\nPRELIMINARY REVIEW\nUpon gathering more information about the incident, OEO/Title IX will assess whether it has a duty to warn the campus community and/or take other actions, as necessary.\nCOMPLAINT FILED\nAfter an initial review, OEO/Title IX will determine whether the complaint states sufficient facts demonstrating that a violation of university policy may have occurred. If the complaint states facts that, if proven, would be a violation of the  discrimination policy, an  investigation will move forward. If not, the complaint will be dismissed.\nA complaint dismissal may be appealed to the Chief Human Resources Officer for employees and students, or to the Customer Services Director for University Hospitals and Clinics when a complaint is filed by a patient, who will either agree or disagree with the initial decision. If this person disagrees with OEO/Title IX, the case will be remanded back to OEO/Title IX for investigation.\nNOTICE OF INVESTIGATION\nWhen an investigation begins, notice is provided to the person against whom the complaint is filed (the \"Respondent\") as well as the cognizant university vice president over the Respondent and any other university administrators who have a business need-to-know.\nINTERVIEWS AND EVIDENCE GATHERING\nOEO/Title IX will interview the complainant and respondents separately, interview witnesses, gather documents, and other evidence.\nOEO DRAFT REPORT\nOnce the investigation is completed, OEO/Title IX will draft a report that is shared with the parties involved. The parties have ten (10) days to submit a response and/or additional information.\nFrom the time a complaint is accepted for investigation to the time the report is drafted, OEO/Title IX will endeavor to complete the investigation within 60 calendar days.\nOEO REPORT\nIn cases alleging Sexual Misconduct, OEO will issue a recommendation of whether or not a policy violation has occurred.  The determination about whether a policy was violated will be determined in a hearing (see Hearing).\nIn cases alleging other types of discrimination, OEO will issue a finding of whether or not a policy violation has occurred.\nFindings and/or recommendations are shared with the Complainant, Respondent(s), the cognizant vice president over the Respondent(s), and may also be shared with Human Resources, Office for Faculty, and/or the Office of the Dean of Students.\nThe OEO report will have one of two outcomes:\nCAUSE - this means that OEO has made a finding or a recommendation that a violation of the university\'s nondiscrimination policy HAS occurred.\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE - this means that OEO has made a finding or a recommendation that a policy of the university\'s nondiscrimination policy has NOT occurred.\nHEARING\nIn cases alleging sexual misconduct, the case automatically is scheduled for a hearing before a hearing committee.\nIn cases alleging other types of discrimination, if either party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the OEO/Title IX report, they may request a hearing within five days of the issuance of the OEO Report. If no hearing is requested, the process concludes and the OEO Report becomes the final decision of the University.\nINITIAL REVIEW BY HEARING COMMITTEE\nIn discrimination cases that result in a finding of \"insufficient evidence,\" the hearing Committee will first review the OEO/Title IX report and accompanying evidence to determine whether a hearing should be held.\nThe Committee is composed of a three-person panel, which includes a committee Chair.\nDiscrimination cases that result in a \"cause\" finding and all cases alleging sexual misconduct, do not involve an initial review and instead move directly to the hearing.\nCOMMITTEE HEARING\nA hearing will be convened with notice given to both parties of the time, date, and location of the hearing.  Generally, hearings will be held using technology allowing all parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. Each party may be accompanied by an advisor of their choice, which may be an attorney, and also may also be accompanied by one support person of their choice.  If a party does not have an advisor, the University will provide an advisor for the limited purpose of conducting cross examination of the other party and any witnesses.  Each party will be permitted up to 45 minutes for opening statements, and extensions of time may be granted by the Chair of the Hearing Committee. Each party may also call witnesses and provide documents and other evidence.\nWithin 10 days of the hearing, the committee will issue its decision whether there is \'cause\' or \'insufficient evidence\' to show that a violation of policy has occurred.\nAPPEALS\nIf either party disagrees with the decision of the Hearing Committee, they may submit an appeal within five days.\nIf a timely appeal is not received, the decision becomes final.\nFINAL DECISION\nIf the decision of the Hearing Committee is appealed, the appeal goes to the cognizant Vice President or Designee, or in cases involving a faculty member, the appeal goes to the President or designee.  The decision is the final outcome by the university.\nSUPPORTIVE MEASURES\nThe University provides equitable resources and campus services to all parties involved. When an incident is brought to the attention of OEO/Title IX, Complainants (those who have experienced discrimination or sexual misconduct) and Respondents (those alleged to have engaged in discrimination or sexual misconduct) have access to a variety of resources and supportive measures aimed at protecting safety and minimizing disruption to academic pursuits. These are available regardless of whether or not a complaint is filed or of the resulting outcomes.\nUNIVERSITY\nPOLICE\nReport a crime, safety escorts, etc.\nLEARN MORE\nVICTIM-SURVIVOR\nADVOCATES\nA confidential resource center\nLEARN MORE\nOFFICE OF THE DEAN OF STUDENTS\nAcademic adjustments, etc.\nLEARN MORE\nTRAINING AND EDUCATION\nBystander intervention, consent, etc.\nLEARN MORE\nSAFE U\nSafety & Reporting\nresources\nLEARN MORE\nNO-CONTACT DIRECTIVES\nDifferent from legal no-contact orders\nLEARN MORE\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nOEO/Title IX\nJohn R.
