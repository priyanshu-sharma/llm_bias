Title IX - Sexual Misconduct
University of Utah policy prohibits sex discrimination, which includes sexual misconduct.
Sexual Misconduct is the most egregious form of sex discrimination. Title IX of the
Education Amendments Act of 1972 is the comprehensive federal law that prohibits discrimination
on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity.
Policies, procedures, and resources are in place to take immediate and appropriate
steps to remedy violations of University policy and the university will take steps
to end or eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence and to remedy
the effects, as appropriate under each individual’s circumstances.
Complaints of sexual misconduct should be made directly to the Office of Equal Opportunity
and Affirmative Action.
Please see the Title IX Coordinator Outreach letter to learn about your specific rights to seek out Supportive Measures and options for
accountability through the OEO/AA process or through law enforcement.

Definitions
Sexual Misconduct
As defined by University Rule, R1-012: Discrimination Complaint Rule, Sexual Misconduct
is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors including Sexual or Gender-Based
Harassment, Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Exploitation, Stalking, Nonconsensual
Sexual Contact, and Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration. Sexual Misconduct also includes
the crimes of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking as defined
by state and federal law. Sexual Misconduct is a form of Sex Discrimination. The following
definitions of prohibited conduct apply to University policies.
Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment
As defined by University Rule, R1-012, Discrimination Complaint Rule, Sexual Harassment
means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature or based on an individual’s sex, sexual orientation, gender,
gender identity, or gender expression when:
Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition
of an individual’s employment, education, living environment, health care or participation
in a university program activity;
Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
or a factor in decisions affecting that individual’s employment, education, living
environment, or participation in a university program or activity; or
Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual’s employment
or educational performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment
for that individual’s employment, education, living environment, or participation
in a university program or activity.
Consent
Consent means affirmative, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement. For a nonexhaustive
list of situations in which consent has not been given, see Utah Code Ann. 76-5-406.
Interpersonal Partner Violence
means actual or threatened physical violence, intimidation, or other forms of physical
or sexual abuse that would cause a reasonable person to fear harm to self or others.
For this policy, “intimate relationship” means marriage, domestic partnership, engagement,
casual or serious romantic involvement, and dating, whether in a current or former
relationship. Intimate Partner Violence can occur between persons of any sex, sexual
orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, and it can occur in any
type of intimate relationship including monogamous, non-committed, and relationships
involving more than two partners. Intimate Partner Violence can be a single act or
a pattern of behavior. Intimate Partner Violence is sometimes referred to as, and
includes behaviors that would be considered, dating violence, domestic violence, or
relationship abuse. Examples of Intimate Partner Violence include, but are not limited
to, situations in which the following behaviors are directed toward a partner in a
current or former intimate relationship: hitting, kicking, strangling, or other violence;
property damage; and threat of violence to one’s self, one’s partner, or the family
members, friends, pets, or personal property of the partner. Intimate Partner Violence
is a form of Sexual Misconduct.
Nonconsensual Sexual Contact
means any physical contact with another person of a sexual nature without that person’s
Consent. The touching of a person’s intimate parts (such as genitalia, groin, breast,
buttocks, mouth, or clothing covering same); touching a person with one’s own intimate
parts; or forcing a person to touch another’s intimate parts would be violations of
this policy if they occur without Consent. Nonconsensual Sexual Contact is a form
of Sexual Misconduct.
Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration
means the sexual penetration of any bodily opening with any object or body part without
Consent. This could be committed by force, threat, intimidation, or through exploitation of
another’s mental or physical condition (such as lack of consciousness, incapacitation
due to drugs or alcohol, age, or disability) of which the Respondent was actually
aware or which a reasonable person in the Respondent’s position should have been aware.
Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration is a form of Sexual Misconduct.
Sex Discrimination
means treating someone differently, i.e., disadvantaging the person, on the basis
of sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression when:
such conduct adversely affects a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
education, living environment, or participation in a University program or activity;
or
a person’s sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression is used
as the basis for or a factor in decisions affecting that individual’s employment,
education, living environment, health care, or participation in a University program
or activity.
Sexual Violence
means any physical sexual act perpetrated against a person’s will or where a person
is incapable of giving consent (e.g., due to age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because
an intellectual or other disability prevents the person from having the capacity to
give consent).
Stalking
means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person and based on that’s
person’s sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, that
would cause a reasonable person to fear for the person’s safety or the safety of others
or suffer substantial emotional distress. Stalking is a form of Sexual Misconduct.
The Free and Open Discussion
Discussion of issues or theories relating to sexuality or gender in an academic or
professional setting, when appropriate to subject matter, will be presumed not to
constitute sexual harassment even if it offends or embarrasses an individual unless
other factors are involved. Such factors include targeting the discussion to an individual
or carrying out the discussion in terms that are both patently unnecessary and gratuitously
offensive.
Mandatory Reporting
Under university policy, most University employees are required to report situations
involving sexual misconduct and discrimination to the Office of Equal Opportunity
and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA)
Some situations may be very personal; we respect your privacy and will protect it
in accordance with University of Utah policy and FERPA. Although information about
the situation may be reported to the OEO/AA, you have the right to choose to whom
you speak, what you say, when you say it and what resources you use. If you prefer
to speak first with a confidential resource (confidential resources are not required
to report information to the OEO/AA, you may contact one of the groups below.
Information provided to OEO/AA is considered private information and will only be shared with other appropriate university personnel on
a very strict need-to-know basis.

Current Page: Prohibited Discrimination
Prohibited Discrimination
Discrimination is partiality or bias in the treatment of a person or group that is
unfair or violates law or policy. Treating someone differently based on a protected class violates University policy. A protected class is a group of people protected against
discrimination by University policy or by state and federal law.
Protected Classes
icon Color icon Raceicon Ethnicityicon National Originicon Ageicon Religionicon Disabilityicon Veteran Statusicon Pregnancy icon Sexicon Sexual Orientationicon Gender Identityicon Gender Expressionicon Genetic Information
Not all discrimination violates law or policy. One can be subject to unfair treatment
that does not violate University policy or state or federal law. An example would
be being treated unfairly because someone doesn’t like you or because of your political
affiliations.
Discriminatory Harassment
What is Discriminatory Harassment?
The University’s nondiscrimination policy applies broadly to students, employees,
and visitors. Hostile environment is a commonly used term but from a legal and policy
perspective, a hostile environment is a form of discriminatory harassment.
Harassment means unwelcome or offensive conduct which has the purpose or effect of
interfering with an individuals’ work or academic environment or creating an intimidating
hostile, offensive or otherwise working or learning environment based upon a person’s
race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity, gender expression, or protected veteran’s status. The University’s
Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA) is responsible for the
University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Many people have heard the term “hostile environment” in the context of sexual harassment
but a “hostile environment” can also include harassment because of race, color, national
origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and
protected veteran’s status. For harassment not related to discrimination, contact
Human Resources.
What constitutes a hostile environment? What are the range of scenarios that people
might experience?
A hostile environment can be created in many ways. Verbal comments, text messages,
pictures, graphics, graffiti and physical conduct can create a hostile environment.
This might look like racial slurs, comments about a person’s national origin, or behavior
or words that mock, demean, put down, disparage, threaten or ridicule others based
upon race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity/expression and protected veteran’s status.
An isolated statement, even if rude and offensive, generally does not constitute a
hostile environment. Occasional insensitive and off-hand comments, even if inappropriate
or unprofessional, will generally not create a hostile environment. The focus is whether
the behavior, as a whole, affecting a person’s education or working environment. In order to interfere with a person’s work or educational environment, generally
the conduct must be severe, recurring and pervasive so that it interferes with your
ability to fulfill your work and academic pursuits.
Although an occasional comment may not constitute a violation of the University’s
nondiscrimination policy, other provisions of University policy governing student
and employee conduct may apply. It is important to mention that the University, in
terms of student, visitor, and employee conduct, has an interest in preventing discrimination
and harassment. For example, if a department has an employee who tells an inappropriate
joke then other employees begin to participate in similar types of comments, believing
that such behavior is condoned, the workplace can then develop into a hostile environment
for those that find such conduct unwelcome and offensive.
If someone feels like they are experiencing a hostile environment, what options are
open to them to deal with the situation?
The first step is to tell the individual that their comments are unwelcome and unwanted.
Sometimes this may be difficult but once you have made it clear that their comments
are not welcome, the individual has clearly been notified that you find their behavior
unwelcome and offensive. Once the individual clearly understands the behavior isn’t
welcome yet continues to engage in similar behavior, disciplinary action may be appropriate.
There are many options on the University campus that can assist you in addressing
the unwanted and unwelcome behavior. The Office of the Dean of Students, Human Resources, and the Office of Equal Opportunity are all avenues that can assist you in addressing
the unwelcome behavior.
How are issues like these handled to protect the person dealing with hostility while
also being fair to the Respondent?
The Office of Equal Opportunity is neutral and impartial whose purpose in an investigation
is to determine the facts. Both parties are provided an opportunity to provide their
side of the story. Obtaining both the perspective of the person dealing with the hostility
as well as the person alleged to have engaged in the behavior is important in terms
of treating both parties fairly. Although both parties are given an opportunity to
provide their side of the story, it is important to remember that it doesn’t matter
whether the behavior was intended to hurt the other individual. An investigation by
the Office of Equal Opportunity would look at whether a reasonable person would take
offense to the unwanted or unwelcome behavior.
RETALIATION
University policy prohibits retaliation against an individual for having made a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, hearing, or
proceeding under the University’s nondiscrimination policies or for interfering with
the rights of individuals under the University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Examples of retaliation include:
demoting, disciplining, or harassing an employee because the employee files or reports
discrimination or sexual misconduct to OEO/AA
interfering with witnesses or others who may be interviewed as part of an investigation
giving a lower grade because a student does not accede to sexual advances
If you believe you have experienced discriminatory conduct, including sexual misconduct,
or retaliation, you may file a complaint with our office.

Discussion of issues or theories relating to sexuality or gender in an academic or
professional setting, when appropriate to subject matter, will be presumed not to
constitute sexual harassment even if it offends or embarrasses an individual unless

or carrying out the discussion in terms that are both patently unnecessary and gratuitously
offensive.
Mandatory Reporting
Under university policy, most University employees are required to report situations
involving sexual misconduct and discrimination to the Office of Equal Opportunity
and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA)
Some situations may be very personal; we respect your privacy and will protect it
in accordance with University of Utah policy and FERPA. Although information about
the situation may be reported to the OEO/AA, you have the right to choose to whom
you speak, what you say, when you say it and what resources you use. If you prefer
to speak first with a confidential resource (confidential resources are not required
to report information to the OEO/AA, you may contact one of the groups below.
Information provided to OEO/AA is considered private information and will only be shared with other appropriate university personnel on
a very strict need-to-know basis.

Current Page: Prohibited Discrimination
Prohibited Discrimination
Discrimination is partiality or bias in the treatment of a person or group that is
unfair or violates law or policy. Treating someone differently based on a protected class violates University policy. A protected class is a group of people protected against
discrimination by University policy or by state and federal law.
Protected Classes
icon Color icon Raceicon Ethnicityicon National Originicon Ageicon Religionicon Disabilityicon Veteran Statusicon Pregnancy icon Sexicon Sexual Orientationicon Gender Identityicon Gender Expressionicon Genetic Information
Not all discrimination violates law or policy. One can be subject to unfair treatment
that does not violate University policy or state or federal law. An example would
be being treated unfairly because someone doesn’t like you or because of your political
affiliations.
Discriminatory Harassment
What is Discriminatory Harassment?
The University’s nondiscrimination policy applies broadly to students, employees,
and visitors. Hostile environment is a commonly used term but from a legal and policy
perspective, a hostile environment is a form of discriminatory harassment.
Harassment means unwelcome or offensive conduct which has the purpose or effect of
interfering with an individuals’ work or academic environment or creating an intimidating
hostile, offensive or otherwise working or learning environment based upon a person’s
race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity, gender expression, or protected veteran’s status. The University’s
Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA) is responsible for the
University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Many people have heard the term “hostile environment” in the context of sexual harassment
but a “hostile environment” can also include harassment because of race, color, national
origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and
protected veteran’s status. For harassment not related to discrimination, contact
Human Resources.
What constitutes a hostile environment? What are the range of scenarios that people
might experience?
A hostile environment can be created in many ways. Verbal comments, text messages,
pictures, graphics, graffiti and physical conduct can create a hostile environment.
This might look like racial slurs, comments about a person’s national origin, or behavior
or words that mock, demean, put down, disparage, threaten or ridicule others based
upon race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity/expression and protected veteran’s status.
An isolated statement, even if rude and offensive, generally does not constitute a
hostile environment. Occasional insensitive and off-hand comments, even if inappropriate
or unprofessional, will generally not create a hostile environment. The focus is whether
the behavior, as a whole, affecting a person’s education or working environment. In order to interfere with a person’s work or educational environment, generally
the conduct must be severe, recurring and pervasive so that it interferes with your
ability to fulfill your work and academic pursuits.
Although an occasional comment may not constitute a violation of the University’s
nondiscrimination policy, other provisions of University policy governing student
and employee conduct may apply. It is important to mention that the University, in
terms of student, visitor, and employee conduct, has an interest in preventing discrimination
and harassment. For example, if a department has an employee who tells an inappropriate
joke then other employees begin to participate in similar types of comments, believing
that such behavior is condoned, the workplace can then develop into a hostile environment
for those that find such conduct unwelcome and offensive.
If someone feels like they are experiencing a hostile environment, what options are
open to them to deal with the situation?
The first step is to tell the individual that their comments are unwelcome and unwanted.
Sometimes this may be difficult but once you have made it clear that their comments
are not welcome, the individual has clearly been notified that you find their behavior
unwelcome and offensive. Once the individual clearly understands the behavior isn’t
welcome yet continues to engage in similar behavior, disciplinary action may be appropriate.
There are many options on the University campus that can assist you in addressing
the unwanted and unwelcome behavior. The Office of the Dean of Students, Human Resources, and the Office of Equal Opportunity are all avenues that can assist you in addressing
the unwelcome behavior.
How are issues like these handled to protect the person dealing with hostility while
also being fair to the Respondent?
The Office of Equal Opportunity is neutral and impartial whose purpose in an investigation
is to determine the facts. Both parties are provided an opportunity to provide their
side of the story. Obtaining both the perspective of the person dealing with the hostility
as well as the person alleged to have engaged in the behavior is important in terms
of treating both parties fairly. Although both parties are given an opportunity to
provide their side of the story, it is important to remember that it doesn’t matter
whether the behavior was intended to hurt the other individual. An investigation by
the Office of Equal Opportunity would look at whether a reasonable person would take
offense to the unwanted or unwelcome behavior.
RETALIATION
University policy prohibits retaliation against an individual for having made a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, hearing, or
proceeding under the University’s nondiscrimination policies or for interfering with
the rights of individuals under the University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Examples of retaliation include:
demoting, disciplining, or harassing an employee because the employee files or reports
discrimination or sexual misconduct to OEO/AA
interfering with witnesses or others who may be interviewed as part of an investigation
giving a lower grade because a student does not accede to sexual advances
If you believe you have experienced discriminatory conduct, including sexual misconduct,
or retaliation, you may file a complaint with our office.

What constitutes a hostile environment? What are the range of scenarios that people
might experience?
A hostile environment can be created in many ways. Verbal comments, text messages,
pictures, graphics, graffiti and physical conduct can create a hostile environment.
This might look like racial slurs, comments about a person’s national origin, or behavior
or words that mock, demean, put down, disparage, threaten or ridicule others based
upon race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
gender identity/expression and protected veteran’s status.
An isolated statement, even if rude and offensive, generally does not constitute a
hostile environment. Occasional insensitive and off-hand comments, even if inappropriate
or unprofessional, will generally not create a hostile environment. The focus is whether
the behavior, as a whole, affecting a person’s education or working environment. In order to interfere with a person’s work or educational environment, generally
the conduct must be severe, recurring and pervasive so that it interferes with your
ability to fulfill your work and academic pursuits.
Although an occasional comment may not constitute a violation of the University’s
nondiscrimination policy, other provisions of University policy governing student
and employee conduct may apply. It is important to mention that the University, in
terms of student, visitor, and employee conduct, has an interest in preventing discrimination
and harassment. For example, if a department has an employee who tells an inappropriate
joke then other employees begin to participate in similar types of comments, believing
that such behavior is condoned, the workplace can then develop into a hostile environment
for those that find such conduct unwelcome and offensive.
If someone feels like they are experiencing a hostile environment, what options are
open to them to deal with the situation?
The first step is to tell the individual that their comments are unwelcome and unwanted.
Sometimes this may be difficult but once you have made it clear that their comments
are not welcome, the individual has clearly been notified that you find their behavior
unwelcome and offensive. Once the individual clearly understands the behavior isn’t
welcome yet continues to engage in similar behavior, disciplinary action may be appropriate.
There are many options on the University campus that can assist you in addressing
the unwanted and unwelcome behavior. The Office of the Dean of Students, Human Resources, and the Office of Equal Opportunity are all avenues that can assist you in addressing
the unwelcome behavior.
How are issues like these handled to protect the person dealing with hostility while
also being fair to the Respondent?
The Office of Equal Opportunity is neutral and impartial whose purpose in an investigation
is to determine the facts. Both parties are provided an opportunity to provide their
side of the story. Obtaining both the perspective of the person dealing with the hostility
as well as the person alleged to have engaged in the behavior is important in terms
of treating both parties fairly. Although both parties are given an opportunity to
provide their side of the story, it is important to remember that it doesn’t matter
whether the behavior was intended to hurt the other individual. An investigation by
the Office of Equal Opportunity would look at whether a reasonable person would take
offense to the unwanted or unwelcome behavior.
RETALIATION
University policy prohibits retaliation against an individual for having made a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, hearing, or
proceeding under the University’s nondiscrimination policies or for interfering with
the rights of individuals under the University’s nondiscrimination policies.
Examples of retaliation include:
demoting, disciplining, or harassing an employee because the employee files or reports
discrimination or sexual misconduct to OEO/AA
interfering with witnesses or others who may be interviewed as part of an investigation
giving a lower grade because a student does not accede to sexual advances
If you believe you have experienced discriminatory conduct, including sexual misconduct,
or retaliation, you may file a complaint with our office.
