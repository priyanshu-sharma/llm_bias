Schools are required to ensure that campuses are free of sex discrimination and have an established procedure for handling complaints. The University of Utah has a Title IX coordinator to handle complaints of sex discrimination, including complaints of sexual assault and harassment:\nSherrie Hayashi, Title IX coordinator\nOffice of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action/Title IX\n383 SOUTH UNIVERSITY STREET, LEVEL 1 OEO SUITE\nSALT LAKE CITY, UT 84112\n801-581-8365\noeo@utah.edu\nVisit the U Title IX Website\nKnow Your Title IX\nWhat is the Title IX reporting process like?\nWhen disclosing information to a Title IX investigator, you may be asked for a description of the incident including the date, time, location, and information about the perpetrator(s). Reports of sexual misconduct are processed through the Title IX Coordinator, who is housed in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA). If you or a mandatory reporter disclose information to the OEO/AA, you may be contacted to provide more information. Throughout the process, you can control the information you share and can choose to stop sharing at any point. You may also choose to file a formal complaint and proceed with an investigation or resolve the matter through informal resolution.\nSupportive Measures are available to help support you, whether or not you wish to file a formal complaint with our office. Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge.\xc2\xa0 If you choose, we can work with the appropriate campus office to obtain extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, refer you to counseling and/or victim advocacy services, and also implement safety and protective measures, such as no-contact directives, campus escort services, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus and other similar measures. You may also request one-on-one training, education, or other requests as defined by you such as asking us to tell the other party that their behavior is expected to stop.\xc2\xa0 Training may be able to be implemented anonymously but that may limit our ability to address the behavior. Supportive Measures are available, whether or not you file a Formal Complaint with OEO/AA.\nChoosing to report an incident of sexual misconduct can feel empowering for a survivor. However, the reporting process can be emotionally difficult. Some students may be reluctant to report to the police. Some students may also be wary of re-victimization and re-traumatization. The survivor should have the choice of whether or not to report and continue with an investigation. Talking to a confidential resource can help a survivor decide which options are best for them.\nWhat is the investigation/adjudication process like?\nEach investigation and adjudication process is individualized, but the following is a basic outline of the Title IX process related to allegations of sexual misconduct.\xc2\xa0 Under Title IX, there are two different types of cases:\xc2\xa0 1) Sexual misconduct is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors. It includes Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment, Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Violence, Stalking, Nonconsensual Sexual Contact, and Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration. Sexual Misconduct is a type of Sex or Gender-Based Discrimination; and 2) Discrimination - Being treated differently because of sex/gender.\nAfter a Title IX formal complaint is filed, the complaint is assessed to determine whether or not the conduct violates the university's nondiscrimination policies. Both the complaining party (person making the complaint) and the responding party (person who is accused of misconduct) are interviewed for information regarding the complaint. Parties may have an advisor of their choice with them when being interviewed. When available, documentary evidence is reviewed, and witnesses are interviewed as well. Investigations may take up to 60 days or the parties will be informed of the reasons the investigation cannot be completed within 60 days.\n1) Procedures for sexual misconduct cases:\nAt the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO will issue recommendations that are published in a report that is shared with both parties to the complaint. Recommendations are categorized as either \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient evidence\xe2\x80\x9d as to whether university policy was violated.\nIf the OEO recommends that there is cause to believe that university policy has been violated, recommendations for disciplinary actions (sanctions) will be made. In the case of students, the Office of the Dean of Students makes recommendations for sanctions.\nAfter the issuance of the OEO report, a hearing will be scheduled before a three-person hearing committee.\xc2\xa0 The hearing committee will make the decision whether or not a violation of university policy has occurred. The Hearing Committee will also make the decision as to any sanctions should be imposed against the Respondent and any remedies that should be provided to the Complainant.\xc2\xa0 Parties may have one advisor and one support person of their choice present at hearings. If a party does not have an advisor, a university-appointed advisor will be appointed, without fee or charge to the party.\xc2\xa0 A university-appointed advisor cannot provide advice, including legal advice to a party.\xc2\xa0 The role of a University-appointed advisor is for the sole purpose of conducting questioning of the other party, any witnesses, and any others who have provided information as part of the investigative or hearing process.\xc2\xa0 Hearings are usually held using Zoom or other similar technology. Students and staff may appeal the decision of the hearing committee to the applicable vice president. Faculty may appeal the decisions of the hearing committee to the president.\n2) Procedures for sex/gender discrimination cases:\nAt the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO will issue findings that are published in a report that is shared with both parties to the complaint. Recommendations are categorized as either \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient evidence\xe2\x80\x9d as to whether university policy was violated.\nIf the OEO recommends that there is cause to believe that university policy has been violated, recommendations for disciplinary actions (sanctions) will be made. In the case of students, the Office of the Dean of Students makes recommendations for sanctions.\nIn discrimination cases, a hearing is not automatically scheduled.\xc2\xa0 Rather, either party may request a hearing before a hearing committee.\xc2\xa0 The process is similar to a sexual misconduct hearing as described above.\xc2\xa0 Parties may choose to have one advisor and one support person; except university-provided advisors are not appointed if a party does not have an advisor of their choice.\nGet More Information on the University\xe2\x80\x99s Sexual Misconduct Complaint Process\nGet More Information on the University\xe2\x80\x99s Sexual Misconduct Complaint Process\nView the Flow Chart Process\nCRISIS SERVICES\n24-hour hotlines for information and support |\xc2\xa0If you are in immediate crisis or feel unsafe, call 911.\nUNIVERSITY SAFETY\nEmergencies: 911\nNon-emergencies: 801-585-2677\nRAPE RECOVERY CENTER\nCRISIS LINE\n801-736-4356\nHUNTSMAN\nMENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTE\n801-587-3000\nQUICK EXIT\nClick or press 'ESC'\nto leave page quickly.\nQUICK LINKS\nThe Fine Print\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nNondiscrimination & Accessibility\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\n201 Presidents Circle Room 201SLC UT 84112801.581.7200\n\xc2\xa9 2023 The University of Utah\nPrivacy Policy  |  Disclaimer  |  Nondiscrimination & Accessibility\""];

While Title IX is a very short statute, Supreme Court decisions and guidance from the U.S. Department of Education have given it a broad scope covering sexual harassment and sexual violence. Under Title IX, schools are legally required to respond and remedy hostile educational environments and failure to do so is a violation that means a school could risk losing its federal funding.\nWhile Title IX was previously a powerful tool to stop sexual violence and harassment in schools, On August 14th, 2020, the Department\xe2\x80\x99s new Title IX rule went into effect. Make no mistake: the Rule drastically rolls back protections for student survivors and makes it easier for schools to sweep sexual harassment under the rug. Visit our Hands off IX resources and toolkit to learn more about your rights in light of the rule and how you hold school administrations accountable.\nThe below resources are intended to help you determine if your school is in compliance with Title IX. Although these resources have been written with the guidance of legal experts, we are not lawyers, and the information on this website does not constitute legal advice. We encourage you to contact a lawyer to discuss your complaint or suit.\nNotices of Nondiscrimination\nTitle IX Coordinators\nClear Grievance Procedures\nPrompt Responses to Violence\nUnder Title IX, schools must disseminate a notice of nondiscrimination. This notice does not have to specify that sexual harassment and violence are likewise prohibited, but the U.S. Department of Education (ED) recommends that schools do, since a notice that makes it unclear may qualify as a violation of Title IX. This notice is likely available in a student handbook or code of conduct in elementary and secondary schools and in an Annual Security Report (ASR) in higher education institutions.\nThis notice prohibiting sex discrimination must be widely distributed, available, and easily accessible to the school community each year. ED recommends schools:\nPublish this policy online and have it available in print across campus so that school members may understand its purpose and utility\nInclude enough detail in the policy so that members of the community can realize sexual harassment and sexual violence are prohibited forms of sex discrimination\nTitle IX rule requires every educational institution receiving federal funding to have a Title IX Coordinator. The contact information (name/title, office address, telephone number, email address) of the Coordinator should be available both in your school\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscrimination notice, but also in an annual security report or higher education institutions. Both victims and third parties should contact the Coordinator to report incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual violence.\nThe Title IX Coordinator ensures schools are compliant with Title IX, coordinates the investigation and disciplinary process, and looks for patterns or systematic problems with compliance to ensure schools fulfill all their federal obligations. The Coordinator may not have any other job responsibility that creates a conflict of interest with their responsibilities under Title IX. For example, the Title IX coordinator may not also sit on a disciplinary board or serve as legal counsel to the college.\nWhen a school does not have a Title IX Coordinator or list that individual\xe2\x80\x99s contact information, then your college is non-compliant with Title IX.\nIf the Coordinator has another job responsibility that creates conflicts of interest, your school is likely in violation of Title IX.\nSchools are required to adopt and publish a grievance procedure outlining the complaint, investigation, and disciplinary process for addressing sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence occurring within \xe2\x80\x9ceducation program or activity\xe2\x80\x9d which the Department states \xe2\x80\x9cincludes locations, events, or circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a post-secondary institution.\xe2\x80\x9d This process should address discrimination perpetrated by students, employees, or third parties, but only if the respondent is currently enrolled or employed by the school. Additionally, school security and/or law enforcement personnel must notify survivors\xc2\xa0 of their rights to use the school\xe2\x80\x99s grievance procedure in addition to being able to file a criminal complaint.\nThis grievance procedure requires the school\xe2\x80\x99s process be \xe2\x80\x9cprompt and equitable,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning it must be a timely response to discrimination and provide both parties equivalent rights during the disciplinary process rather than having one-sided due process.t.\nWhere the Rule falls short, states and schools must implement policies to uphold students\xe2\x80\x99 right to a timely and trauma-informed investigation, written or electronic notes of any meeting, and a review of all available and relevant evidence.\nWhile sexual misconduct complaints may be resolved through informal mechanisms, such as mediation, students are not required to use informal methods of grievance resolution and should not be pressured into such a process.\nIn addition to being obligated to survivors, schools must address hostile educational environments created by sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence school-wide. Addressing a hostile environment means remedying a current situation, addressing its effects, and preventing its recurrence in the future. Schools may meet this obligation through providing educational and awareness programming on sexual harassment or discrimination.\nEmployee Training: Both the Clery Act and Title IX rule require school employees that address sexual violence complaints to have appropriate training. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) also recommends that professors, campus police, administrators, counselors, health center staff, cleaning staff, coaches, resident advisers and others likely to receive reports be trained on how to identify and report sexual harassment and violence.\nAccording to the Department of Education, schools need to:\nEnsure that responsible employees with the authority to address sexual violence know how to respond appropriately to reports of sexual violence; that other responsible employees know that they are obligated to report sexual violence to appropriate school officials; and that all other employees understand how to respond to reports of sexual violence.\nMake sure professional counselors, pastoral counselors, and non-professional counselors or advocates understand the extent to which they may keep a report confidential.\nProvide training to all employees likely to witness or receive reports of sexual violence, including teachers, professors, school law enforcement unit employees, school administrators, school counselors, general counsels, athletic coaches, health personnel, and resident advisors.\nA school also should train responsible employees to inform students of:\nThe reporting obligations of responsible employees;\nStudents\xe2\x80\x99 option to request confidentiality and available confidential advocacy, counseling, or other support services; and\nTheir right to file a Title IX complaint with the school and to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement.\nWhile sexual misconduct complaints may be resolved through informal mechanisms, such as mediation, students are not required to use informal methods of grievance resolution and should not be pressured into such a process.\nIn addition to being obligated to survivors, schools must address hostile educational environments created by sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence school-wide.

The U.S. Department of Education (ED) also recommends that professors, campus police, administrators, counselors, health center staff, cleaning staff, coaches, resident advisers and others likely to receive reports be trained on how to identify and report sexual harassment and violence.\nAccording to the Department of Education, schools need to:\nEnsure that responsible employees with the authority to address sexual violence know how to respond appropriately to reports of sexual violence; that other responsible employees know that they are obligated to report sexual violence to appropriate school officials; and that all other employees understand how to respond to reports of sexual violence.\nMake sure professional counselors, pastoral counselors, and non-professional counselors or advocates understand the extent to which they may keep a report confidential.\nProvide training to all employees likely to witness or receive reports of sexual violence, including teachers, professors, school law enforcement unit employees, school administrators, school counselors, general counsels, athletic coaches, health personnel, and resident advisors.\nA school also should train responsible employees to inform students of:\nThe reporting obligations of responsible employees;\nStudents\xe2\x80\x99 option to request confidentiality and available confidential advocacy, counseling, or other support services; and\nTheir right to file a Title IX complaint with the school and to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement.\nSchools are required to be prompt when receiving a complaint of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual violence in order to remedy any hostile educational environment created by such behaviors. ED has not provided details on the length of time they consider to be \xe2\x80\x9cprompt,\xe2\x80\x9d but will evaluate a school\xe2\x80\x99s effort to conduct a fair, impartial investigation in a timely manner. If the length of your investigation has impeded on your access to an education and further created a hostile environment you may have grounds for an OCR complaint. A simultaneous police investigation does not remove a school\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to resolve a complaint under Title IX. While a school may delay its response to accommodate a police investigation, schools that delay the Title IX complaint process unreasonably are in violation of Title IX.\"\nReporting Options:Title IX Guidance reminded schools that they have an obligation under the Clery Act to inform victims of their reporting options. Schools must notify victims of their right to report to police and facilitate that process if desired by the victim. Victims also have the right not to report to the police.\nRegardless of a victim\xe2\x80\x99s choice to report to the police, a victim may use a school\xe2\x80\x99s grievance procedure to address sexual harassment or sexual violence or merely seek accommodations. When reasonable, schools must accommodate a victim on campus to remedy a hostile environment on a school\xe2\x80\x99s campus. This means schools may change academic or extracurricular schedules to prevent an ongoing hostile education environment or put in place safety measures, such as a no-contact directive or facilitate a student obtaining a restraining order. The burden of accommodations or safety measures should not be solely placed on the victim, as this may be seen as a violation of Title IX.\"\nReporting Options:Title IX Guidance reminded schools that they have an obligation under the Clery Act to inform victims of their reporting options.

Learn more.)\nIn addition, since Title IX is a federal civil right, the appropriate standard of evidence is a \xe2\x80\x9cpreponderance of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d This standard of evidence means that a hearing must determine whether a complaint of sex discrimination is \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not\xe2\x80\x9d to have occurred or 51% likely to have occurred. This standard applies for all complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment and violence, because Title IX outlines standards for school disciplinary processes \xe2\x80\x94 not criminal complaints, which require the highest standard of evidence, \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe 2017 Interim Guidance allows schools to use the \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing\xe2\x80\x9d evidence standard, but only if all other forms of campus misconduct investigations utilize this standard.\nRetaliation:As a federal civil right, Title IX automatically protects any individual who reports sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual violence against retaliation. This means employees and third party reports are protected along with reporting victims from any adverse consequence, harassment, intimidation, or discrimination that is causally related to reporting sex discrimination under Title IX. Schools must protect against other employees or students retaliating against a reporting party when it \xe2\x80\x9cknows or should know\xe2\x80\x9d about the retaliatory harassment or behavior.\nIf a school discourages or threatens you about discussing complaints of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual violence, this may be considered retaliation.\nSupport Know Your IX\nDonate to Know Your IX today to support our efforts to empower students on campuses across the country.

Effective date: March 16, 2022\nPurpose and Scope\nThe University of Utah (\xe2\x80\x9cUniversity\xe2\x80\x9d) is committed to providing and fostering an environment\nthat is safe and free from Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination. Among\nother forms of prohibited Discrimination, University Policy prohibits Discrimination\non the basis of sex, which includes all forms of Sexual Misconduct. University Policy\nalso prohibits Retaliation against individuals for engaging in protected activities,\nsuch as filing a Discrimination Complaint or participating in a Discrimination Complaint\nprocess.\nThis rule outlines the process the University will use to resolve Complaints of Sexual\nMisconduct. This rule is also intended to educate the University community, including\ncurrent students, prospective students and employees, about Sexual Misconduct and\nabout campus resources and processes available to victim-survivors of Sexual Misconduct.\nDefinitions\nFor purposes of Policy 1-012 and its associated Rules and Guideline, including this Rule 1-012B, the definitions\nof prohibited Discrimination and other words and phrases are provided in Rule 1-012.\nRule\nPrevention and Awareness.\xc2\xa0The University offers comprehensive programing intended to end Dating Violence, Domestic\nViolence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking. The University provides education and training\ndesigned to raise awareness of these issues and engages in efforts that aim to reduce\nharm, improve communication skills, foster healthy relationships, improve bystander\nintervention skills, and educate the campus community on the definitions of Consent,\nSexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking through orientations\neach semester given to incoming students. The University of Utah Department of Public\nSafety (\xe2\x80\x9cUDPS\xe2\x80\x9d) offers sexual assault education and information programs to University\nstudents and employees upon request. Literature on date rape education, risk reduction,\nand University response, as well as educational programs about the same, are available\nthrough various University Student Affairs offices including the Office of Housing\n& Residential Education and through the University\'s Center for Student Wellness.\nThe University provides primary prevention and awareness programs for incoming students\nand new employees, and ongoing programs for students, staff, and faculty which includes:\na statement that the University prohibits the offenses of Domestic Violence, Dating\nViolence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking;\nthe Utah statutory definitions of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,\nand stalking;\nthe Utah statutory definitions of consent, in reference to sexual activity;\nsafe and positive options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an\nindividual to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of Domestic Violence,\nDating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking;\ninformation on risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior, information\nfor those who may be at risk to perpetrate harm, and how to avoid potential attacks;\nand\ndefinitions of Sexual Misconduct under University Policy, as well as a copy of University\nPolicy 1-012, Rules 1-012, 1-012A, and 1-012B, and Guidline 1-012.\nInitial Response.\xc2\xa0The first priority of any person who has been subject to Sexual Violence should be\nto get to a safe place and then obtain necessary medical treatment and emotional support.\nVictim-survivors may seek and receive a medical forensic examination free of charge\nfrom a local hospital emergency department without submitting a police report. The\nUniversity strongly encourages victim-survivors to report all incidents of Sexual\nMisconduct as soon as possible. Time is a critical factor for evidence collection\nand preservation.\nRole of Law Enforcement.\xc2\xa0The victim-survivor of an incident of Sexual Violence (rape,\nfondling, incest, statutory rape), Dating Violence, Domestic Violence and Stalking\nis encouraged, but not required, to report the incident directly to the University\nDepartment of Public Safety (\xe2\x80\x9cUDPS\xe2\x80\x9d) or the local law enforcement entity for the jurisdiction\nin which the incident took place.\nAlternatively, or in conjunction with a report to law enforcement, victim-survivors\nmay make a report to the Office of Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (OEO/AA)\n(see Section (III)(C)), the Office of the Dean of Students, a Housing & Residential\nEducation representative, and/or another University representative. Filing a police\nreport will not obligate the victim-survivor to pursue a complaint through the criminal\nprocess. Filing a police report will:\nensure the victim-survivor receives appropriate medical treatment, including a medical\nforensic exam at no expense;\nprovides the opportunity for collection of evidence helpful in prosecution, which\ncannot be obtained later (ideally, a victim-survivor of Sexual Violence should not\nwash, use the toilet, or change clothing prior to a medical forensic exam); and\nprovide the victim-survivor with available resources, including supportive resources.\nA victim-survivor may request any University representative to assist them in notifying\nlaw enforcement authorities about an incident of Sexual Violence (rape, fondling,\nincest, statutory rape) Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking and any other\nbehavior that may constitute a crime.\nWhen a victim-survivor contacts the UDPS, the UDPS will notify the Title IX Coordinator,\nthe OEO/AA, and the Office of the Dean of Students (if related to a student). A victim-\nsurvivor may choose for an investigation to be pursued either through the criminal\njustice system, through this rule, or both. Victim-survivors may also choose not to\nproceed in the criminal justice system or under this rule (subject to Section (III)(D)\nof this rule). A representative from the Center for Student Wellness Victim-Survivor\nAdvocacy program, Chief Safety Office Community Services Division, UDPS, the Office\nof the Dean of Students, the Title IX Coordinator, and/or the OEO/AA will guide the\nvictim-survivor through the available options.\nWhere applicable, UDPS will enforce orders of protection, no contact orders, restraining\norders, civil stalking injunctions, or similar lawful orders issued by a criminal,\ncivil, or tribal court.\nRole of the OEO/AA.\xc2\xa0The OEO/AA is the University department charged with responding to reports and investigating\nFormal Complaints of Discrimination, including Sexual Misconduct.\nThe Director of the OEO/AA serves as the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator.\nSherrie Hayashi Director, Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Title\nIX/ADA/Section 504 Coordinator University of Utah 383 University Street, Level 1,\nSuite OEO, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 Phone: (801) 581-8365 Fax: (801) 585-5746 oeo@utah.edu\xc2\xa0www.oeo.utah.edu\nUpon receipt of a report of alleged Sexual Misconduct, Complainants will promptly\nreceive information from the Title IX Coordinator that:\nprovides the Complainant with written notification of and assist the Complainant in\naccessing counseling, mental health and healthcare, victim advocacy, legal, academic\nsupport, and other resources available in the community and on-campus;\noffers and discusses Supportive Measures with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint;\nconsiders the Complainant\'s wishes with respect to Supportive Measures;\nexplains the process for filing a Formal Complaint; and\ninforms the Complainant of the right to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement\nand provide the Complainant with assistance, if requested.\nConfidentiality.1 The University encourages victim-survivors of Sexual Misconduct to talk to someone\nabout what happened. Different employees on campus have different requirements to\nmaintain a victim- survivor\xe2\x80\x99s confidentiality.\nCompletely Confidential.\xc2\xa0Professional and pastoral counselors are completely confidential,\nexcept any reporting required by state and federal law, and do not report any information\ndisclosed by a Complainant to the University or to the OEO/AA.\nLimited Confidentiality.\xc2\xa0Nonprofessional counselors and advocates (e.g., individuals\nwho are not professional counselors and who work or volunteer, including front desk\xc2\xa0staff\nand students, in the University Counseling Center, Center for Student Wellness, Center\nfor Student Wellness Victim-Survivor Advocacy program, Ombuds Office, or counseling\nservices in the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Resource Center, must report only general information about\ncrimes required to be reported under the Clery Act to the Chief Safety Office \xe2\x80\x94 such\nas the nature, date, time, and general location of the incident\xe2\x80\x94in a way that does\nnot identify the individuals involved.\nClery Reporting Requirements.\xc2\xa0Under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the\nClery Act, the University is required to complete publicly available record- keeping\non crimes required to be reported by the Clery Act in accordance with federal law,\nbut will not disclose identifying information.

If the Complainant wants to maintain confidentiality, the Mandatory Reporter\nshould direct the Complainant to confidential resources.\nIf the Complainant wants to tell the Mandatory Reporter what happened but also requests\nconfidentiality, requests that no investigation occur, or requests that no action\nbe taken against the Respondent, the Mandatory Reporter should tell the Complainant\nthat the University will consider the request, but cannot guarantee that the University\nwill be able to honor it.\nRequests for Confidentiality.\xc2\xa0If a Complainant discloses an incident to a Mandatory Reporter but wishes to maintain\nconfidentiality, or requests that no investigation into a particular incident be conducted\nor disciplinary action taken, the University must weigh that request against the University\xe2\x80\x99s\nobligation to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment for all students, including\nthe Complainant.\nThe University has designated the Title IX Coordinator to evaluate requests for allegations\nof Sexual Misconduct.\nIf the University determines that it cannot maintain a Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s confidentiality,\nthe University will inform the Complainant prior to starting an investigation and\nwill, to the extent possible, only share information with people responsible for handling\nthe University\xe2\x80\x99s response.\nSupportive Measures.\xc2\xa0When the University receives information about alleged Sexual Misconduct, an appropriate\nUniversity representative (such as the Dean of Students, cognizant supervisor, or\nHuman Resources (HR) representative) may offer Supportive Measures to either or both\nparties which will generally remain in effect throughout and potentially beyond the\nduration of the University investigation. Supportive Measures will be offered under\nthe auspices of the Title IX Coordinator; University representatives should consult\nwith the Title IX Coordinator in offering any Supportive Measures. The University\nwill offer Supportive Measures if they are reasonably available, regardless of whether\nthe Complainant chooses to file a complaint with the OEO/AA or with law enforcement.\nBecause the University is under a continuing obligation to address the issue of Sexual\nMisconduct campus-wide, reports of Sexual Misconduct (including non-identifying reports)\nwill also prompt the University to consider broader remedial action.\nAmnesty.\xc2\xa0An individual who makes a good faith report of Sexual Harassment or Sexual Misconduct\nthat was directed at them or another person will not be sanctioned for a violation\nrelated to the use of drugs or alcohol that is related to the report.\nNon-Disclosure of Information.\xc2\xa0Parties will be provided evidence obtained by the OEO/AA as part of the investigation\nthat is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint (the \"Evidence\");\nthe parties and party advisors must keep all such evidence strictly confidential and\nuse such evidence solely for the purposes of participating in the Sexual Misconduct\ninvestigation and grievance process.

Effective date: March 16, 2022\nPurpose and Scope\nThe University of Utah (\xe2\x80\x9cUniversity\xe2\x80\x9d) is committed to providing and fostering an environment\nthat is safe and free from Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination. Among\nother forms of prohibited Discrimination, University Policy prohibits Discrimination\non the basis of sex, which includes all forms of Sexual Misconduct. University Policy\nalso prohibits Retaliation against individuals for engaging in protected activities,\nsuch as filing a Discrimination Complaint or participating in a Discrimination Complaint\nprocess.\nThis rule outlines the process the University will use to resolve Complaints of Sexual\nMisconduct. This rule is also intended to educate the University community, including\ncurrent students, prospective students and employees, about Sexual Misconduct and\nabout campus resources and processes available to victim-survivors of Sexual Misconduct.\nDefinitions\nFor purposes of Policy 1-012 and its associated Rules and Guideline, including this Rule 1-012B, the definitions\nof prohibited Discrimination and other words and phrases are provided in Rule 1-012.\nRule\nPrevention and Awareness.\xc2\xa0The University offers comprehensive programing intended to end Dating Violence, Domestic\nViolence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking. The University provides education and training\ndesigned to raise awareness of these issues and engages in efforts that aim to reduce\nharm, improve communication skills, foster healthy relationships, improve bystander\nintervention skills, and educate the campus community on the definitions of Consent,\nSexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking through orientations\neach semester given to incoming students. The University of Utah Department of Public\nSafety (\xe2\x80\x9cUDPS\xe2\x80\x9d) offers sexual assault education and information programs to University\nstudents and employees upon request. Literature on date rape education, risk reduction,\nand University response, as well as educational programs about the same, are available\nthrough various University Student Affairs offices including the Office of Housing\n& Residential Education and through the University\'s Center for Student Wellness.\nThe University provides primary prevention and awareness programs for incoming students\nand new employees, and ongoing programs for students, staff, and faculty which includes:\na statement that the University prohibits the offenses of Domestic Violence, Dating\nViolence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking;\nthe Utah statutory definitions of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,\nand stalking;\nthe Utah statutory definitions of consent, in reference to sexual activity;\nsafe and positive options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an\nindividual to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of Domestic Violence,\nDating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking;\ninformation on risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior, information\nfor those who may be at risk to perpetrate harm, and how to avoid potential attacks;\nand\ndefinitions of Sexual Misconduct under University Policy, as well as a copy of University\nPolicy 1-012, Rules 1-012, 1-012A, and 1-012B, and Guidline 1-012.\nInitial Response.\xc2\xa0The first priority of any person who has been subject to Sexual Violence should be\nto get to a safe place and then obtain necessary medical treatment and emotional support.\nVictim-survivors may seek and receive a medical forensic examination free of charge\nfrom a local hospital emergency department without submitting a police report. The\nUniversity strongly encourages victim-survivors to report all incidents of Sexual\nMisconduct as soon as possible. Time is a critical factor for evidence collection\nand preservation.\nRole of Law Enforcement.\xc2\xa0The victim-survivor of an incident of Sexual Violence (rape,\nfondling, incest, statutory rape), Dating Violence, Domestic Violence and Stalking\nis encouraged, but not required, to report the incident directly to the University\nDepartment of Public Safety (\xe2\x80\x9cUDPS\xe2\x80\x9d) or the local law enforcement entity for the jurisdiction\nin which the incident took place.\nAlternatively, or in conjunction with a report to law enforcement, victim-survivors\nmay make a report to the Office of Equal Opportunity & Affirmative Action (OEO/AA)\n(see Section (III)(C)), the Office of the Dean of Students, a Housing & Residential\nEducation representative, and/or another University representative. Filing a police\nreport will not obligate the victim-survivor to pursue a complaint through the criminal\nprocess. Filing a police report will:\nensure the victim-survivor receives appropriate medical treatment, including a medical\nforensic exam at no expense;\nprovides the opportunity for collection of evidence helpful in prosecution, which\ncannot be obtained later (ideally, a victim-survivor of Sexual Violence should not\nwash, use the toilet, or change clothing prior to a medical forensic exam); and\nprovide the victim-survivor with available resources, including supportive resources.\nA victim-survivor may request any University representative to assist them in notifying\nlaw enforcement authorities about an incident of Sexual Violence (rape, fondling,\nincest, statutory rape) Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking and any other\nbehavior that may constitute a crime.\nWhen a victim-survivor contacts the UDPS, the UDPS will notify the Title IX Coordinator,\nthe OEO/AA, and the Office of the Dean of Students (if related to a student). A victim-\nsurvivor may choose for an investigation to be pursued either through the criminal\njustice system, through this rule, or both. Victim-survivors may also choose not to\nproceed in the criminal justice system or under this rule (subject to Section (III)(D)\nof this rule). A representative from the Center for Student Wellness Victim-Survivor\nAdvocacy program, Chief Safety Office Community Services Division, UDPS, the Office\nof the Dean of Students, the Title IX Coordinator, and/or the OEO/AA will guide the\nvictim-survivor through the available options.\nWhere applicable, UDPS will enforce orders of protection, no contact orders, restraining\norders, civil stalking injunctions, or similar lawful orders issued by a criminal,\ncivil, or tribal court.\nRole of the OEO/AA.\xc2\xa0The OEO/AA is the University department charged with responding to reports and investigating\nFormal Complaints of Discrimination, including Sexual Misconduct.\nThe Director of the OEO/AA serves as the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator.\nSherrie Hayashi Director, Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Title\nIX/ADA/Section 504 Coordinator University of Utah 383 University Street, Level 1,\nSuite OEO, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 Phone: (801) 581-8365 Fax: (801) 585-5746 oeo@utah.edu\xc2\xa0www.oeo.utah.edu\nUpon receipt of a report of alleged Sexual Misconduct, Complainants will promptly\nreceive information from the Title IX Coordinator that:\nprovides the Complainant with written notification of and assist the Complainant in\naccessing counseling, mental health and healthcare, victim advocacy, legal, academic\nsupport, and other resources available in the community and on-campus;\noffers and discusses Supportive Measures with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint;\nconsiders the Complainant\'s wishes with respect to Supportive Measures;\nexplains the process for filing a Formal Complaint; and\ninforms the Complainant of the right to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement\nand provide the Complainant with assistance, if requested.\nConfidentiality.1 The University encourages victim-survivors of Sexual Misconduct to talk to someone\nabout what happened. Different employees on campus have different requirements to\nmaintain a victim- survivor\xe2\x80\x99s confidentiality.\nCompletely Confidential.\xc2\xa0Professional and pastoral counselors are completely confidential,\nexcept any reporting required by state and federal law, and do not report any information\ndisclosed by a Complainant to the University or to the OEO/AA.\nLimited Confidentiality.\xc2\xa0Nonprofessional counselors and advocates (e.g., individuals\nwho are not professional counselors and who work or volunteer, including front desk\xc2\xa0staff\nand students, in the University Counseling Center, Center for Student Wellness, Center\nfor Student Wellness Victim-Survivor Advocacy program, Ombuds Office, or counseling\nservices in the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Resource Center, must report only general information about\ncrimes required to be reported under the Clery Act to the Chief Safety Office \xe2\x80\x94 such\nas the nature, date, time, and general location of the incident\xe2\x80\x94in a way that does\nnot identify the individuals involved.\nClery Reporting Requirements.\xc2\xa0Under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the\nClery Act, the University is required to complete publicly available record- keeping\non crimes required to be reported by the Clery Act in accordance with federal law,\nbut will not disclose identifying information. The University will maintain as confidential\nany Protective Measures provided to the victim-survivor, to the extent that maintaining\nsuch confidentiality would not impair the ability of the institution to provide the\nProtective Measures.\nConfidential Resources.\xc2\xa0The following are resources are\xc2\xa0confidential. *These offices must report general information about crimes reportable under the\nClery Act to the Chief Safety Office in a way that\xc2\xa0does not identify\xc2\xa0the individuals involved, such as the nature, date, time, and general location of\nthe incident. This information is required to be included in the University\xe2\x80\x99s Annual\nSecurity Report under the Clery Act, and in rare circumstances may result in the issuance\nof a timely warning or other University obligations under Clery/VAWA.\nUniversity Counseling Center\nStudent Services Building201 S 1640 E, Room 426Salt Lake City, UT 84112(801) 581-682624-hour Crisis Line: (801) 587-3000\nUniversity Hospital Chaplains\nUniversity of Utah Hospital 50 N.

If the Complainant wants to maintain confidentiality, the Mandatory Reporter\nshould direct the Complainant to confidential resources.\nIf the Complainant wants to tell the Mandatory Reporter what happened but also requests\nconfidentiality, requests that no investigation occur, or requests that no action\nbe taken against the Respondent, the Mandatory Reporter should tell the Complainant\nthat the University will consider the request, but cannot guarantee that the University\nwill be able to honor it.\nRequests for Confidentiality.\xc2\xa0If a Complainant discloses an incident to a Mandatory Reporter but wishes to maintain\nconfidentiality, or requests that no investigation into a particular incident be conducted\nor disciplinary action taken, the University must weigh that request against the University\xe2\x80\x99s\nobligation to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment for all students, including\nthe Complainant.\nThe University has designated the Title IX Coordinator to evaluate requests for allegations\nof Sexual Misconduct.\nIf the University determines that it cannot maintain a Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s confidentiality,\nthe University will inform the Complainant prior to starting an investigation and\nwill, to the extent possible, only share information with people responsible for handling\nthe University\xe2\x80\x99s response.\nSupportive Measures.\xc2\xa0When the University receives information about alleged Sexual Misconduct, an appropriate\nUniversity representative (such as the Dean of Students, cognizant supervisor, or\nHuman Resources (HR) representative) may offer Supportive Measures to either or both\nparties which will generally remain in effect throughout and potentially beyond the\nduration of the University investigation. Supportive Measures will be offered under\nthe auspices of the Title IX Coordinator; University representatives should consult\nwith the Title IX Coordinator in offering any Supportive Measures. The University\nwill offer Supportive Measures if they are reasonably available, regardless of whether\nthe Complainant chooses to file a complaint with the OEO/AA or with law enforcement.\nBecause the University is under a continuing obligation to address the issue of Sexual\nMisconduct campus-wide, reports of Sexual Misconduct (including non-identifying reports)\nwill also prompt the University to consider broader remedial action.\nAmnesty.\xc2\xa0An individual who makes a good faith report of Sexual Harassment or Sexual Misconduct\nthat was directed at them or another person will not be sanctioned for a violation\nrelated to the use of drugs or alcohol that is related to the report.\nNon-Disclosure of Information.\xc2\xa0Parties will be provided evidence obtained by the OEO/AA as part of the investigation\nthat is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint (the \"Evidence\");\nthe parties and party advisors must keep all such evidence strictly confidential and\nuse such evidence solely for the purposes of participating in the Sexual Misconduct\ninvestigation and grievance process. Parties who disseminate or use such evidence\nfor any other purpose may be subject to discipline.\nOEO/AA Investigation.\xc2\xa0In cases of Sexual Misconduct, the OEO/AA will begin an investigation upon acceptance\nof a Formal Complaint. The University will not require a Complainant to participate\nin any investigation or disciplinary proceeding; however, failure to participate may\nlimit the University\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond.\nUpon acceptance of a Formal Complaint, the OEO/AA will provide written notice:\nto the appropriate University administrator, which may include the supervisor, Chair,\nDean, and/or cognizant Vice President with responsibility over the Respondent and\nany others with a legitimate business need.\nIf the Respondent is a student, the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Office\nof Dean of Students will also be notified.\nIf the Respondent is a Vice President, another Vice President will be selected as\nthe cognizant Vice President for purposes of this rule.\nto the Complainant and the Respondent providing:\nthe applicable policies and associated rules by which the proceedings will be governed;\nsufficient details of the allegations including the identities of the parties involved,\nthe date and location of the alleged incident(s), and the conduct allegedly constituting\na violation of University Policy, if known;\na statement that each party will have an equal opportunity to submit and review evidence\nthroughout the investigation;\na statement that the Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct\nuntil a determination is made at the conclusion of the grievance process;\na statement informing the Complainant and Respondent that they may have one advisor\nof their choice, who may be, but is not required to be an attorney and one Support\nPerson of their choice; and\nthat Rule 1-012(III)(D)(10) prohibits knowingly making false statements or knowingly\nsubmitting false statements during the grievance process.\nIf, during the course of the investigation, allegations arise about the Complainant\nor Respondent that were not included in the initial notice, the OEO/AA will provide\nnotice of the additional allegations and provide the Respondent with an opportunity\nto respond.\nThe Respondent shall be afforded a full opportunity to respond to the allegations\ncontained in the Complaint. Failure to respond or participate in an interview by the\nRespondent or a witness will not prevent the completion of the investigation.\nThe OEO/AA will not draw an inference about the determination of responsibility based\nsolely on a party\xe2\x80\x99s or witness\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to participate in the investigative\nor hearing process; however, evidence for review will be limited to that provided\nby parties and witnesses who participate in the investigation.\nThe OEO/AA shall interview the Complainant, the Respondent, and may interview any\nother person with relevant information.
