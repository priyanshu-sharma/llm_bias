Let the survivor know that you and the Title IX coordinator will preserve their privacy and that they can file a complaint through Title IX (OEO/AA), if they wish.\nExamples of what to say:\nI am required to report this information so the university can provide support for your safety and ensure you have information about your options.\nA victim advocate or the Title IX coordinator will be reaching out to you. As part of that process, you have the right to choose to whom you may speak, what resources you use and what you say.\nThe information you share with me and the Title IX coordinator is private and will only be shared on a need-to-know basis.\nStart by believing. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t your job to investigate the issue. Suspend any judgement and avoid victim-blaming. Victim-blaming includes placing any portion of the blame, no matter how small, on the person who experienced the misconduct. Listen and use supportive phrases, such as, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry this happened to you\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI want to help you get support through this,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\nRefer the survivor to campus resources such as the victim advocates, the University Counseling Center or the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Resource Center. They can make sure the survivor knows exactly what resources and options are available to them after experiencing sexual misconduct. More information on resources for survivors can be found here.\nReport the information to the Title IX coordinator in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 801-581-8365.\nFor more information on how to respond, visit these pages:\nRAINN\nDean of Students (fourth tab)\nReports of sexual misconduct are processed through the Title IX coordinator, located in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action.

Schools are required to ensure that campuses are free of sex discrimination and have an established procedure for handling complaints. The University of Utah has a Title IX coordinator to handle complaints of sex discrimination, including complaints of sexual assault and harassment:\nSherrie Hayashi, Title IX coordinator\nOffice of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action/Title IX\n383 SOUTH UNIVERSITY STREET, LEVEL 1 OEO SUITE\nSALT LAKE CITY, UT 84112\n801-581-8365\noeo@utah.edu\nVisit the U Title IX Website\nKnow Your Title IX\nWhat is the Title IX reporting process like?\nWhen disclosing information to a Title IX investigator, you may be asked for a description of the incident including the date, time, location, and information about the perpetrator(s). Reports of sexual misconduct are processed through the Title IX Coordinator, who is housed in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA). If you or a mandatory reporter disclose information to the OEO/AA, you may be contacted to provide more information. Throughout the process, you can control the information you share and can choose to stop sharing at any point. You may also choose to file a formal complaint and proceed with an investigation or resolve the matter through informal resolution.\nSupportive Measures are available to help support you, whether or not you wish to file a formal complaint with our office. Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge.\xc2\xa0 If you choose, we can work with the appropriate campus office to obtain extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, refer you to counseling and/or victim advocacy services, and also implement safety and protective measures, such as no-contact directives, campus escort services, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus and other similar measures. You may also request one-on-one training, education, or other requests as defined by you such as asking us to tell the other party that their behavior is expected to stop.\xc2\xa0 Training may be able to be implemented anonymously but that may limit our ability to address the behavior. Supportive Measures are available, whether or not you file a Formal Complaint with OEO/AA.\nChoosing to report an incident of sexual misconduct can feel empowering for a survivor. However, the reporting process can be emotionally difficult. Some students may be reluctant to report to the police. Some students may also be wary of re-victimization and re-traumatization. The survivor should have the choice of whether or not to report and continue with an investigation. Talking to a confidential resource can help a survivor decide which options are best for them.\nWhat is the investigation/adjudication process like?\nEach investigation and adjudication process is individualized, but the following is a basic outline of the Title IX process related to allegations of sexual misconduct.\xc2\xa0 Under Title IX, there are two different types of cases:\xc2\xa0 1) Sexual misconduct is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors. It includes Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment, Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Violence, Stalking, Nonconsensual Sexual Contact, and Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration. Sexual Misconduct is a type of Sex or Gender-Based Discrimination; and 2) Discrimination - Being treated differently because of sex/gender.\nAfter a Title IX formal complaint is filed, the complaint is assessed to determine whether or not the conduct violates the university's nondiscrimination policies. Both the complaining party (person making the complaint) and the responding party (person who is accused of misconduct) are interviewed for information regarding the complaint. Parties may have an advisor of their choice with them when being interviewed. When available, documentary evidence is reviewed, and witnesses are interviewed as well. Investigations may take up to 60 days or the parties will be informed of the reasons the investigation cannot be completed within 60 days.\n1) Procedures for sexual misconduct cases:\nAt the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO will issue recommendations that are published in a report that is shared with both parties to the complaint. Recommendations are categorized as either \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient evidence\xe2\x80\x9d as to whether university policy was violated.\nIf the OEO recommends that there is cause to believe that university policy has been violated, recommendations for disciplinary actions (sanctions) will be made. In the case of students, the Office of the Dean of Students makes recommendations for sanctions.\nAfter the issuance of the OEO report, a hearing will be scheduled before a three-person hearing committee.\xc2\xa0 The hearing committee will make the decision whether or not a violation of university policy has occurred. The Hearing Committee will also make the decision as to any sanctions should be imposed against the Respondent and any remedies that should be provided to the Complainant.\xc2\xa0 Parties may have one advisor and one support person of their choice present at hearings. If a party does not have an advisor, a university-appointed advisor will be appointed, without fee or charge to the party.\xc2\xa0 A university-appointed advisor cannot provide advice, including legal advice to a party.\xc2\xa0 The role of a University-appointed advisor is for the sole purpose of conducting questioning of the other party, any witnesses, and any others who have provided information as part of the investigative or hearing process.\xc2\xa0 Hearings are usually held using Zoom or other similar technology. Students and staff may appeal the decision of the hearing committee to the applicable vice president. Faculty may appeal the decisions of the hearing committee to the president.\n2) Procedures for sex/gender discrimination cases:\nAt the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO will issue findings that are published in a report that is shared with both parties to the complaint. Recommendations are categorized as either \xe2\x80\x9ccause,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient evidence\xe2\x80\x9d as to whether university policy was violated.\nIf the OEO recommends that there is cause to believe that university policy has been violated, recommendations for disciplinary actions (sanctions) will be made. In the case of students, the Office of the Dean of Students makes recommendations for sanctions.\nIn discrimination cases, a hearing is not automatically scheduled.\xc2\xa0 Rather, either party may request a hearing before a hearing committee.\xc2\xa0 The process is similar to a sexual misconduct hearing as described above.\xc2\xa0 Parties may choose to have one advisor and one support person; except university-provided advisors are not appointed if a party does not have an advisor of their choice.\nGet More Information on the University\xe2\x80\x99s Sexual Misconduct Complaint Process\nGet More Information on the University\xe2\x80\x99s Sexual Misconduct Complaint Process\nView the Flow Chart Process\nCRISIS SERVICES\n24-hour hotlines for information and support |\xc2\xa0If you are in immediate crisis or feel unsafe, call 911.\nUNIVERSITY SAFETY\nEmergencies: 911\nNon-emergencies: 801-585-2677\nRAPE RECOVERY CENTER\nCRISIS LINE\n801-736-4356\nHUNTSMAN\nMENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTE\n801-587-3000\nQUICK EXIT\nClick or press 'ESC'\nto leave page quickly.\nQUICK LINKS\nThe Fine Print\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nNondiscrimination & Accessibility\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\n201 Presidents Circle Room 201SLC UT 84112801.581.7200\n\xc2\xa9 2023 The University of Utah\nPrivacy Policy  |  Disclaimer  |  Nondiscrimination & Accessibility\""];

The institution\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary process is designed to:\nDETERMINE IF INSTITUTIONAL POLICY HAS BEEN VIOLATED\nPROVIDE RESOLUTIONS THAT EDUCATE RESPONDENTS\nREMEDY THE EFFECTS OF MISCONDUCT\nPROTECT INDIVIDUALS IN THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY FROM FURTHER\nMISCONDUCT\nOEO/Title IX conducts investigations into allegations of discrimination or sexual misconduct.\xc2\xa0 When a violation of university policy has occurred, sanctions may be implemented by the appropriate sanctioning body.\nIncidents reported to OEO/Title IX are generally not reported to the police (exceptions may occur when circumstances raise concerns of safety of others, including the broader campus community). Incidents reported to the University of Utah police are reported to OEO/Title IX.\nCriminal and university administrative processes are independent of one another and may result in different outcomes and resolutions.\nGENERAL OEO INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS\nWhen an incident of discrimination or sexual misconduct occurs, it should be reported to OEO/Title IX. Once the office receives information about an incident, OEO/Title IX begins to review and determine how to respond to the reported incident:\nREPORT OF DISCRIMINATION OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT\nWhen OEO/Title IX becomes aware of an incident of discrimination or sexual misconduct, the office immediately begins to explore the issue further to determine the appropriate steps to take based upon the information reported.\nPROVIDE SUPPORTIVE MEASURES\nOEO/Title IX immediately connects individuals with information about supportive measures, resources and information about filing options, including how to file a formal complaint with OEO/AA and law enforcement, if applicable.\nPRELIMINARY REVIEW\nUpon gathering more information about the incident, OEO/Title IX will assess whether it has a duty to warn the campus community and/or take other actions, as necessary.\nCOMPLAINT FILED\nAfter an initial review, OEO/Title IX will determine whether the complaint states sufficient facts demonstrating that a violation of university policy may have occurred. If the complaint states facts that, if proven, would be a violation of the  discrimination policy, an  investigation will move forward. If not, the complaint will be dismissed.\nA complaint dismissal may be appealed to the Chief Human Resources Officer for employees and students, or to the Customer Services Director for University Hospitals and Clinics when a complaint is filed by a patient, who will either agree or disagree with the initial decision. If this person disagrees with OEO/Title IX, the case will be remanded back to OEO/Title IX for investigation.\nNOTICE OF INVESTIGATION\nWhen an investigation begins, notice is provided to the person against whom the complaint is filed (the \"Respondent\") as well as the cognizant university vice president over the Respondent and any other university administrators who have a business need-to-know.\nINTERVIEWS AND EVIDENCE GATHERING\nOEO/Title IX will interview the complainant and respondents separately, interview witnesses, gather documents, and other evidence.\nOEO DRAFT REPORT\nOnce the investigation is completed, OEO/Title IX will draft a report that is shared with the parties involved. The parties have ten (10) days to submit a response and/or additional information.\nFrom the time a complaint is accepted for investigation to the time the report is drafted, OEO/Title IX will endeavor to complete the investigation within 60 calendar days.\nOEO REPORT\nIn cases alleging Sexual Misconduct, OEO will issue a recommendation of whether or not a policy violation has occurred.  The determination about whether a policy was violated will be determined in a hearing (see Hearing).\nIn cases alleging other types of discrimination, OEO will issue a finding of whether or not a policy violation has occurred.\nFindings and/or recommendations are shared with the Complainant, Respondent(s), the cognizant vice president over the Respondent(s), and may also be shared with Human Resources, Office for Faculty, and/or the Office of the Dean of Students.\nThe OEO report will have one of two outcomes:\nCAUSE - this means that OEO has made a finding or a recommendation that a violation of the university\'s nondiscrimination policy HAS occurred.\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE - this means that OEO has made a finding or a recommendation that a policy of the university\'s nondiscrimination policy has NOT occurred.\nHEARING\nIn cases alleging sexual misconduct, the case automatically is scheduled for a hearing before a hearing committee.\nIn cases alleging other types of discrimination, if either party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the OEO/Title IX report, they may request a hearing within five days of the issuance of the OEO Report. If no hearing is requested, the process concludes and the OEO Report becomes the final decision of the University.\nINITIAL REVIEW BY HEARING COMMITTEE\nIn discrimination cases that result in a finding of \"insufficient evidence,\" the hearing Committee will first review the OEO/Title IX report and accompanying evidence to determine whether a hearing should be held.\nThe Committee is composed of a three-person panel, which includes a committee Chair.\nDiscrimination cases that result in a \"cause\" finding and all cases alleging sexual misconduct, do not involve an initial review and instead move directly to the hearing.\nCOMMITTEE HEARING\nA hearing will be convened with notice given to both parties of the time, date, and location of the hearing.  Generally, hearings will be held using technology allowing all parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. Each party may be accompanied by an advisor of their choice, which may be an attorney, and also may also be accompanied by one support person of their choice.  If a party does not have an advisor, the University will provide an advisor for the limited purpose of conducting cross examination of the other party and any witnesses.  Each party will be permitted up to 45 minutes for opening statements, and extensions of time may be granted by the Chair of the Hearing Committee. Each party may also call witnesses and provide documents and other evidence.\nWithin 10 days of the hearing, the committee will issue its decision whether there is \'cause\' or \'insufficient evidence\' to show that a violation of policy has occurred.\nAPPEALS\nIf either party disagrees with the decision of the Hearing Committee, they may submit an appeal within five days.\nIf a timely appeal is not received, the decision becomes final.\nFINAL DECISION\nIf the decision of the Hearing Committee is appealed, the appeal goes to the cognizant Vice President or Designee, or in cases involving a faculty member, the appeal goes to the President or designee.
