Who are responsible employees and who are campus security authorities?
Responsible employees and Campus security authorities (CSAs) have different obligations. Responsible employees are defined by Title IX and CSAs are defined under the Clery Act. Though certain people/positions may be both, the concepts and requirements are different. On our campus, responsible employees are required to report any information about possible sexual misconduct or discrimination to the OEO/AA. CSAs are required to report crimes that occurred on campus to campus police.
Responsible employees are university employees, including students in paid leadership positions, who are required to report sexual misconduct to the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action per university regulations. Examples of responsible employees include:
Professors and other faculty
Administration and staff (non-mental health)
Resident advisors
Student employees
Campus police or campus security officials
Athletic coaches/assistants
Campus security authorities are university employees who have significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including but not limited to student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings and are designated to receive and report criminal incidents to the University of Utah Police Department.
Resources for responsible employees/mandatory reporters:
Tips on how to respond if someone discloses an issue of sexual misconduct to you:
If safety is an immediate concern, call 9-1-1 or University Police at 801-585-2677.
Let the person notifying you know that you are a mandatory reporter and under university policy you are required to inform the Title IX coordinator of the incident. Let the survivor know that you and the Title IX coordinator will preserve their privacy and that they can file a complaint through Title IX (OEO/AA), if they wish.
Examples of what to say:
I am required to report this information so the university can provide support for your safety and ensure you have information about your options.
A victim advocate or the Title IX coordinator will be reaching out to you. As part of that process, you have the right to choose to whom you may speak, what resources you use and what you say.
The information you share with me and the Title IX coordinator is private and will only be shared on a need-to-know basis.
Start by believing. It isn’t your job to investigate the issue. Suspend any judgement and avoid victim-blaming. Victim-blaming includes placing any portion of the blame, no matter how small, on the person who experienced the misconduct. Listen and use supportive phrases, such as, “I’m so sorry this happened to you” and “I want to help you get support through this,” etc.
Refer the survivor to campus resources such as the victim advocates, the University Counseling Center or the Women’s Resource Center. They can make sure the survivor knows exactly what resources and options are available to them after experiencing sexual misconduct. More information on resources for survivors can be found here.
Report the information to the Title IX coordinator in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 801-581-8365.

Title IX (On-Campus) Reporting
Submit a Title IX Complaint (Sexual Misconduct)
What is Title IX?
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination against all genders in educational institutions. Schools are required to ensure that campuses are free of sex discrimination and have an established procedure for handling complaints. The University of Utah has a Title IX coordinator to handle complaints of sex discrimination, including complaints of sexual assault and harassment:

Know Your Title IX
What is the Title IX reporting process like?
When disclosing information to a Title IX investigator, you may be asked for a description of the incident including the date, time, location, and information about the perpetrator(s). Reports of sexual misconduct are processed through the Title IX Coordinator, who is housed in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (OEO/AA). If you or a mandatory reporter disclose information to the OEO/AA, you may be contacted to provide more information. Throughout the process, you can control the information you share and can choose to stop sharing at any point. You may also choose to file a formal complaint and proceed with an investigation or resolve the matter through informal resolution.
Supportive Measures are available to help support you, whether or not you wish to file a formal complaint with our office. Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge.  If you choose, we can work with the appropriate campus office to obtain extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, refer you to counseling and/or victim advocacy services, and also implement safety and protective measures, such as no-contact directives, campus escort services, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus and other similar measures. You may also request one-on-one training, education, or other requests as defined by you such as asking us to tell the other party that their behavior is expected to stop.  Training may be able to be implemented anonymously but that may limit our ability to address the behavior. Supportive Measures are available, whether or not you file a Formal Complaint with OEO/AA.
Choosing to report an incident of sexual misconduct can feel empowering for a survivor. However, the reporting process can be emotionally difficult. Some students may be reluctant to report to the police. Some students may also be wary of re-victimization and re-traumatization. The survivor should have the choice of whether or not to report and continue with an investigation. Talking to a confidential resource can help a survivor decide which options are best for them.
What is the investigation/adjudication process like?
Each investigation and adjudication process is individualized, but the following is a basic outline of the Title IX process related to allegations of sexual misconduct.  Under Title IX, there are two different types of cases:  1) Sexual misconduct is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors. It includes Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment, Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Violence, Stalking, Nonconsensual Sexual Contact, and Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration. Sexual Misconduct is a type of Sex or Gender-Based Discrimination; and 2) Discrimination - Being treated differently because of sex/gender.
After a Title IX formal complaint is filed, the complaint is assessed to determine whether or not the conduct violates the university's nondiscrimination policies. Both the complaining party (person making the complaint) and the responding party (person who is accused of misconduct) are interviewed for information regarding the complaint. Parties may have an advisor of their choice with them when being interviewed. When available, documentary evidence is reviewed, and witnesses are interviewed as well. Investigations may take up to 60 days or the parties will be informed of the reasons the investigation cannot be completed within 60 days.
1) Procedures for sexual misconduct cases:
At the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO will issue recommendations that are published in a report that is shared with both parties to the complaint. Recommendations are categorized as either “cause,” or “insufficient evidence” as to whether university policy was violated.
If the OEO recommends that there is cause to believe that university policy has been violated, recommendations for disciplinary actions (sanctions) will be made. In the case of students, the Office of the Dean of Students makes recommendations for sanctions.
After the issuance of the OEO report, a hearing will be scheduled before a three-person hearing committee.  The hearing committee will make the decision whether or not a violation of university policy has occurred. The Hearing Committee will also make the decision as to any sanctions should be imposed against the Respondent and any remedies that should be provided to the Complainant.  Parties may have one advisor and one support person of their choice present at hearings. If a party does not have an advisor, a university-appointed advisor will be appointed, without fee or charge to the party.  A university-appointed advisor cannot provide advice, including legal advice to a party.  The role of a University-appointed advisor is for the sole purpose of conducting questioning of the other party, any witnesses, and any others who have provided information as part of the investigative or hearing process.  Hearings are usually held using Zoom or other similar technology. Students and staff may appeal the decision of the hearing committee to the applicable vice president. Faculty may appeal the decisions of the hearing committee to the president.
2) Procedures for sex/gender discrimination cases:
At the conclusion of the investigation, the OEO will issue findings that are published in a report that is shared with both parties to the complaint. Recommendations are categorized as either “cause,” or “insufficient evidence” as to whether university policy was violated.
If the OEO recommends that there is cause to believe that university policy has been violated, recommendations for disciplinary actions (sanctions) will be made. In the case of students, the Office of the Dean of Students makes recommendations for sanctions.
In discrimination cases, a hearing is not automatically scheduled.  Rather, either party may request a hearing before a hearing committee.  The process is similar to a sexual misconduct hearing as described above.  Parties may choose to have one advisor and one support person; except university-provided advisors are not appointed if a party does not have an advisor of their choice.

OEO/TITLE IX PROCESS
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS OUTLINE
The University of Utah is committed to maintaining a professional working and learning environment for all.
Contact Us
UNIVERSITY COMMITMENT
THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A PROFESSIONAL WORKING AND LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL.
The Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, which also oversees Title IX, is entrusted with protecting this environment and accomplishes this by implementing and enforcing policies on nondiscrimination. The institution’s disciplinary process is designed to:
DETERMINE IF INSTITUTIONAL POLICY HAS BEEN VIOLATED
PROVIDE RESOLUTIONS THAT EDUCATE RESPONDENTS
REMEDY THE EFFECTS OF MISCONDUCT
PROTECT INDIVIDUALS IN THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY FROM FURTHER
MISCONDUCT
OEO/Title IX conducts investigations into allegations of discrimination or sexual misconduct.  When a violation of university policy has occurred, sanctions may be implemented by the appropriate sanctioning body.
Incidents reported to OEO/Title IX are generally not reported to the police (exceptions may occur when circumstances raise concerns of safety of others, including the broader campus community). Incidents reported to the University of Utah police are reported to OEO/Title IX.
Criminal and university administrative processes are independent of one another and may result in different outcomes and resolutions.
GENERAL OEO INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS
When an incident of discrimination or sexual misconduct occurs, it should be reported to OEO/Title IX. Once the office receives information about an incident, OEO/Title IX begins to review and determine how to respond to the reported incident:
REPORT OF DISCRIMINATION OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT
When OEO/Title IX becomes aware of an incident of discrimination or sexual misconduct, the office immediately begins to explore the issue further to determine the appropriate steps to take based upon the information reported.
PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE MEASURES
OEO/Title IX immediately connects individuals with information about supportive measures, resources and information about filing options, including how to file a formal complaint with OEO/AA and law enforcement, if applicable.
PRELIMINARY REVIEW
Upon gathering more information about the incident, OEO/Title IX will assess whether it has a duty to warn the campus community and/or take other actions, as necessary.
COMPLAINT FILED
After an initial review, OEO/Title IX will determine whether the complaint states sufficient facts demonstrating that a violation of university policy may have occurred. If the complaint states facts that, if proven, would be a violation of the  discrimination policy, an  investigation will move forward. If not, the complaint will be dismissed.
A complaint dismissal may be appealed to the Chief Human Resources Officer for employees and students, or to the Customer Services Director for University Hospitals and Clinics when a complaint is filed by a patient, who will either agree or disagree with the initial decision. If this person disagrees with OEO/Title IX, the case will be remanded back to OEO/Title IX for investigation.
NOTICE OF INVESTIGATION
When an investigation begins, notice is provided to the person against whom the complaint is filed (the "Respondent") as well as the cognizant university vice president over the Respondent and any other university administrators who have a business need-to-know.
INTERVIEWS AND EVIDENCE GATHERING
OEO/Title IX will interview the complainant and respondents separately, interview witnesses, gather documents, and other evidence.
OEO DRAFT REPORT
Once the investigation is completed, OEO/Title IX will draft a report that is shared with the parties involved. The parties have ten (10) days to submit a response and/or additional information.
From the time a complaint is accepted for investigation to the time the report is drafted, OEO/Title IX will endeavor to complete the investigation within 60 calendar days.
OEO REPORT
In cases alleging Sexual Misconduct, OEO will issue a recommendation of whether or not a policy violation has occurred.  The determination about whether a policy was violated will be determined in a hearing (see Hearing).
In cases alleging other types of discrimination, OEO will issue a finding of whether or not a policy violation has occurred.
Findings and/or recommendations are shared with the Complainant, Respondent(s), the cognizant vice president over the Respondent(s), and may also be shared with Human Resources, Office for Faculty, and/or the Office of the Dean of Students.
The OEO report will have one of two outcomes:
CAUSE - this means that OEO has made a finding or a recommendation that a violation of the university's nondiscrimination policy HAS occurred.
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE - this means that OEO has made a finding or a recommendation that a policy of the university's nondiscrimination policy has NOT occurred.
HEARING
In cases alleging sexual misconduct, the case automatically is scheduled for a hearing before a hearing committee.
In cases alleging other types of discrimination, if either party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the OEO/Title IX report, they may request a hearing within five days of the issuance of the OEO Report. If no hearing is requested, the process concludes and the OEO Report becomes the final decision of the University.
INITIAL REVIEW BY HEARING COMMITTEE
In discrimination cases that result in a finding of "insufficient evidence," the hearing Committee will first review the OEO/Title IX report and accompanying evidence to determine whether a hearing should be held.
The Committee is composed of a three-person panel, which includes a committee Chair.
Discrimination cases that result in a "cause" finding and all cases alleging sexual misconduct, do not involve an initial review and instead move directly to the hearing.
COMMITTEE HEARING
A hearing will be convened with notice given to both parties of the time, date, and location of the hearing.  Generally, hearings will be held using technology allowing all parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or the witness answering questions. Each party may be accompanied by an advisor of their choice, which may be an attorney, and also may also be accompanied by one support person of their choice.  If a party does not have an advisor, the University will provide an advisor for the limited purpose of conducting cross examination of the other party and any witnesses.  Each party will be permitted up to 45 minutes for opening statements, and extensions of time may be granted by the Chair of the Hearing Committee. Each party may also call witnesses and provide documents and other evidence.
Within 10 days of the hearing, the committee will issue its decision whether there is 'cause' or 'insufficient evidence' to show that a violation of policy has occurred.
APPEALS
If either party disagrees with the decision of the Hearing Committee, they may submit an appeal within five days.
If a timely appeal is not received, the decision becomes final.
FINAL DECISION
If the decision of the Hearing Committee is appealed, the appeal goes to the cognizant Vice President or Designee, or in cases involving a faculty member, the appeal goes to the President or designee.  The decision is the final outcome by the university.
SUPPORTIVE MEASURES
The University provides equitable resources and campus services to all parties involved. When an incident is brought to the attention of OEO/Title IX, Complainants (those who have experienced discrimination or sexual misconduct) and Respondents (those alleged to have engaged in discrimination or sexual misconduct) have access to a variety of resources and supportive measures aimed at protecting safety and minimizing disruption to academic pursuits. These are available regardless of whether or not a complaint is filed or of the resulting outcomes.

Privacy Statement
The University of Utah has created this statement to demonstrate our firm commitment
to your privacy. This document explains how we gather, use, and protect your information.
We Don't Sell Your Contact Information
While using this site, you may choose to submit personal information through email
or online forms. We will use this information to process your requests. But we will
not intentionally sell, share, or distribute your personal information to third parties,
except as required by law or university policy.
EU General Data Protection Regulation
Please be aware of the University’s GDPR Privacy Notice that supplements this Privacy
Statement. The GDPR Privacy Notice applies generally to the provision of personal
information by individuals in the European Economic Area. The GDPR Privacy Notice
explains how we meet our obligations under the European Union General Data Protection
Regulation with respect to such information. The GDPR Privacy Notice can be found
at https://www.utah.edu/privacy/gdpr.php.
Statistical Logs Kept
The University uses reporting programs to collect data about visitor traffic to our
site. We do not attempt to personally identify visitors. Instead we collect data to
analyze in aggregate to determine trends and improve our sites. Here are some examples
of the types of data we routinely collect:
Internet address of computer
Browser type
Referring web page
Date, time & duration of visit
Cookies Used to Preserve Data
Some U sites require the use of cookies (bits of data passed by your browser to our
site). For instance, the My.Utah.edu portal uses cookies (active only during your
session) to remember password and menu settings. You are not required to use My.Utah.edu;
this tool is provided for your convenience. If you prefer not to receive cookies,
you can turn them off in your browser or set your browser to ask you before accepting
new cookies.
Security Programs Running
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to assist in maintaining data security,
and to assist in correctly using the information we collect online. We do not intentionally
release personal information gleaned from these programs to others, except as required
by law.
Security Precautions You Should Take
Although we make every effort to secure our networks, the University cannot guarantee
privacy of online communications. Use discretion in providing information in online
classes, chatrooms, or other open forums on the Web. If you use My.Utah.edu to access
personal records, be sure to "lock up" when you leave by exiting the site AND closing
your browser. Otherwise, the next person to use the computer may see your information.
Alternate Ways to Submit Information
You have a choice about whether to provide personal information online. For other
options, contact the site manager and learn how you can provide information by phone,
mail, fax or in person.
Other Sites Have Different Policies
This site contains links to other independently managed U sites. Some may use information
for purposes other than stated above; be sure to read their separate privacy statements.
U sites also contain links to sites outside the university; these sites may have their
own privacy statement--or none at all. We urge you to exercise caution when providing
personal data to any site. Check their policies and contact them if you have questions.
Protecting Children's Privacy
We encourage parents to explore our website with their children. If we learn that
a child under age 13 has provided personally identifiable information to our sites,
we will promptly remove this from our files. For more on children's privacy rights,
read about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act at the FTC's website.
