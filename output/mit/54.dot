MIT complies with applicable state and federal statutes, including Title IX. Sexual assault and sexual harassment are forms of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. Read MIT's full non-discrimination policy here. This applies to academic, educational, athletic, residential, and other MIT operated programs.\nMIT is committed to fostering providing a learning, living and working environment free from gender-based discrimination. Gender-based discrimination, committed by MIT students, staff, or faculty will not be tolerated. Gender-based discrimination includes sexual misconduct (a term used to describe a range of behaviors including sexual harassment,\xc2\xa0non-consensual sexual contact/sexual assault, non-consensual sexual penetration/rape, and sexual exploitation), intimate partner violence, and stalking.

Title IX protects people from  discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive  federal financial assistance. Title IX states:\nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education  program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\nScope of Title IX\nTitle IX applies to  schools, local and state educational agencies, and other institutions that  receive federal financial assistance from the Department. These recipients include  approximately 17,600 local school districts, over 5,000 postsecondary  institutions, and charter schools, for-profit schools, libraries, and museums.  Also included are vocational rehabilitation agencies and education agencies of  50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories of the United States.\nA recipient institution that receives Department funds must operate its education program or activity in a nondiscriminatory manner free of discrimination based on sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Some key issue areas in which recipients have Title IX obligations are: recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; treatment of LGBTQI+ students; discipline; single-sex education; and employment. Also, no recipient or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or its implementing regulations, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in a proceeding under Title IX. For a recipient to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. The Department\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX regulations (Volume 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 106) provide additional information about the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.\nOCR\xe2\x80\x99s Enforcement of  Title IX\nOCR vigorously  enforces Title IX to ensure that institutions that receive federal financial  assistance from the Department comply with the law. OCR evaluates,  investigates, and resolves\xc2\xa0complaints\xc2\xa0alleging sex discrimination. OCR also  conducts proactive investigations, through directed investigations or compliance  reviews, to examine potential systemic violations based on sources of  information other than complaints.\nIn addition to its  enforcement activities, OCR provides information and guidance\xc2\xa0to schools, universities and other educational  institutions and agencies to assist them in voluntarily complying with the law.\nTo learn more about  filing a complaint with OCR, please visit https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html.

The Institute prohibits discrimination against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, employment policies, scholarship and loan programs, and other Institute administered programs and activities; the Institute may, however, favor US citizens or residents in admissions and financial aid.*\nThe Vice President for Human Resources is designated as the Institute\'s Equal Opportunity Officer. Inquiries concerning the Institute\'s policies, compliance with applicable laws, statutes, and regulations, and complaints may be directed to Ramona Allen, Vice President for Human Resources, Building NE49-5000, 617-324-5675. In addition, inquiries about Title IX (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex) may be directed to the Institute\'s Title IX Coordinator, Sarah Rankin, Room W31-223, 617-324-7526, idhr@mit.edu. Information about the grievance procedures and process for discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including how to report or file a complaint of sex discrimination, how to report or file a formal complaint of sexual harassment, and how MIT will respond is available at idhr.mit.edu.

For emergencies, including safety concerns for members of the MIT community, call the MIT Police at 617-253-1212 or 100 from a campus phone.  For health concerns, call MIT Medical and Urgent Care at 617-253-4861.  Please visit the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office website at http://idhr.mit.edu for additional information about:\nresources and support services\nInstitute policies and procedures related to discrimination\ndefinitions of key terms\nfrequently asked questions\nBackground Information\nWhat happens when we receive your report? Upon receiving a report of bias or discrimination, the Bias Response Team\xe2\x80\x99s initial response will be determined based on the information immediately available. The timing and manner in which the Bias Response Team (BRT) addresses the report will vary depending on the initial information provided and whether you wish to remain anonymous.  Generally, a member of the BRT will follow up with you to discuss the situation, review formal and informal reporting options, and explore possible resolutions. Your request for resolution will be strongly considered by the BRT. In the event the BRT determines the reported conduct could be considered a \xe2\x80\x9cHate Crime\xe2\x80\x9d under Massachusetts law, the MIT Police will be contacted and will create and coordinate the immediate response plan. What happens if you decide to make an anonymous report? In general, because we are unable to follow up with the reporting party, the BRT will likely take no action regarding anonymous reports. These reports will be used for data gathering purposes. There are some situations where the BRT may take action on an anonymous report. When making this determination, the BRT will weigh the reporting party\xe2\x80\x99s request for anonymity with the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to provide a reasonably safe and non-discriminatory environment. In cases where the BRT determines action is needed, we will keep any potentially identifying information about the reporting party as confidential as possible. Please note:  The information in this report may become part of the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s record and may be available to the students to which they pertain under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
