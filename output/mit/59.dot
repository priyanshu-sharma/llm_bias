See the update history page for more information.\nIn order to create a respectful, welcoming and productive community, the Institute is committed to providing a living, working and learning environment that is free from harassment.\nHarassment is defined as unwelcome conduct of a verbal, nonverbal or physical nature that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a work or academic environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile or abusive and that adversely affects an individual\xe2\x80\x99s educational, work, or living environment.\nIn determining whether unwelcome conduct is harassing, the Institute will examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the conduct, including its frequency, nature and severity, the relationship between the parties and the context in which the conduct occurred. Below is a partial list of examples of conduct that would likely be considered harassing, followed by a partial list of examples that would likely not constitute harassment:\nExamples of possibly harassing conduct: Public and personal tirades; deliberate and repeated humiliation; deliberate interference with the life or work of another person; the use of certain racial epithets; deliberate desecration of religious articles or places; repeated insults about loss of personal and professional competence based on age.\nExamples of conduct that is likely not harassment: Administrative actions like performance reviews (including negative performance reviews) and making work assignments; other work-related decisions like moving work areas or changing work colleagues; and isolated incidents (unless, as noted above, they are very severe, such as the use of certain racial epithets).\nInformation on different ways to raise concerns about harassment can be found on the Complaint Process and Resolution website.\nConduct that does not rise to the level of harassment may still violate Section 9.2. Even conduct that does not violate an MIT policy may be inappropriate and any inappropriate conduct should be addressed by the supervisor or department head.\nWhile MIT\xe2\x80\x99s harassment policy is not limited to harassment based on the protected categories listed in Section 9.3, the Institute is particularly committed to eliminating harassment based on those categories. Harassment that is based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin is not only a violation of MIT policy but may also violate federal and state law, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Mass. General Laws Chapter 151B.\xc2\xa0 For information on how to file complaints of violation of law with governmental agencies see Section 9.8.5.9 Legal Information.\n9.5.1 Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, Gender-Based Harassment, Title IX Sexual Harassment\nThe Institute\xe2\x80\x99s policy against harassment specifically includes a prohibition against sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender-based harassment if the conduct meets the standards of harassment set forth above and has a connection to MIT as described in Section 9.1.\xc2\xa0 Additional guidance is set forth on the Institute Discrimination &\xc2\xa0Harassment Response Office website.\nIn addition, special procedures apply to formal complaints of sexual harassment covered under Title IX Sexual Harassment as defined in Section 9.5.1.4.\n9.5.1.1 Sexual Harassment\nSexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when:\nSubmission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s employment or academic standing; or\nSubmission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for significant employment decisions (such as advancement, performance evaluation, or work schedule) or academic decisions (such as grading or letters of recommendation) affecting that individual; or\nThe conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would consider it intimidating, hostile or abusive and it adversely affects an individual\xe2\x80\x99s educational, work, or living environment.\nA partial list of examples of conduct that might be deemed to constitute sexual harassment if sufficiently severe or pervasive include:\nExamples of verbal sexual harassment may include unwelcome conduct such as sexual flirtation, advances or propositions or requests for sexual activity or dates; asking about someone else\'s sexual activities, fantasies, preferences, or history; discussing one\xe2\x80\x99s own sexual activities, fantasies, preferences, or history;\xc2\xa0verbal abuse of a sexual nature; suggestive comments; sexually explicit jokes; turning discussions at work or in the academic environment to sexual topics;\xc2\xa0and making offensive sounds such as \"wolf whistles.\nExamples of nonverbal sexual harassment may include unwelcome conduct such as displaying sexual objects, pictures or other images; invading a person\'s personal body space, such as standing closer than appropriate or necessary or hovering; displaying or wearing objects or items of clothing which express sexually offensive content; making sexual gestures with hands or body movements; looking at a person in a sexually suggestive or intimidating manner; or delivering\xc2\xa0unwanted letters, gifts, or other items of a sexual nature.\n9.5.1.2 Sexual Misconduct\nSexual misconduct is a broad term that includes sexual assault (rape, sexual fondling, incest or statutory rape) as well sexual exploitation and sexual harassment. Further definitions can be found on the Institute Discrimination &\xc2\xa0Harassment Response Office website.\nDomestic violence and dating violence by an MIT faculty, staff or other community member also violate this policy. Domestic violence and dating violence are defined on the Institute Discrimination &\xc2\xa0Harassment Response Office website.\n9.5.1.3 Gender-Based Harassment\nGender-based harassment is unwelcome verbal or nonverbal conduct based on gender, sex, sex-stereotyping, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy that meets the definitions above of harassment. Gender-based harassment may also involve conduct of a sexual nature.\n9.5.1.4\xc2\xa0Title IX Sexual Harassment\nAlthough MIT broadly prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of sexual misconduct, federal Title IX regulations require MIT to follow specific processes when the Institute has actual knowledge of a report of certain categories of sexual misconduct, referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX Sexual Harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTitle IX Sexual Harassment means: Conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:\nAn employee of MIT conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of MIT on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;\nUnwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to MIT\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity; or\n\xe2\x80\x9cSexual assault,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdating violence,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstalking,\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by federal law and set out on the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR) website.\nMIT must follow the specific processes cited below when it receives a formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment and where all of the following apply:\nAt the time of filing a formal complaint, the Complainant was/is participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity at MIT;\nThe alleged conduct occurred in an education program or activity controlled by MIT; and\nThe alleged conduct occurred against a person in the United States.\nInformation about MIT\xe2\x80\x99s processes for responding to reports of Title IX Sexual Harassment is available here.\xc2\xa0 Formal Complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment are investigated in accordance with the IDHR Investigation Guide and hearings are held in accordance with the process available here\xc2\xa0 for complaints against a faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) and in the Title IX Sexual Harassment Hearing Procedures in the Committee on Discipline Rules for complaints against students.\nFormal Complaints of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct that do not meet the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment are addressed under the complaint resolution process described in Section 9.8 for complaints against a faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) and in the Sexual Misconduct Hearing Procedures (Non-Title IX Sexual Harassment) in the Committee on Discipline Rules for complaints against students.\nMIT prohibits retaliation as set forth in Section 9.7 and the Mind and Handbook. In the context of Title IX Sexual Harassment, this means that: No person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual:\nfor the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX, or\nbecause the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in a Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation, proceeding, or hearing.\nIn addition, retaliation also includes intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX.\nClick here for additional definitions relevant to this Title IX Sexual Harassment policy.\n9.5.1.5\xc2\xa0Notification of Allegations of Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment of Students\nAny MIT employee (including faculty and staff) who is informed of an allegation of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct involving an MIT student must promptly notify the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office (IDHR) of the allegation. Graduate resident advisors, teaching assistants, and other students with advising or teaching responsibilities have this obligation to disclose when they are informed of an allegation due to their respective role, by notifying IDHR. Note that, as defined above, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct are broad terms and include dating and domestic violence as well as stalking.\nStaff who are designated as Confidential Resources do not have this obligation to disclose.\nSee Section 7.3.1 about responsibilities of supervisors to report certain allegations made against employees.\n9.5.2 Stalking\nStalking, whether or not sexual in nature, is prohibited by MIT. \xc2\xa0Stalking is defined as engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others, or to suffer substantial emotional distress.\nStalking can take many forms. Examples include, but are not limited to, two or more instances of the following conduct (that also meet the definition of stalking above): following a person; appearing at a person\xe2\x80\x99s home, class, or work; continuing to contact a person after receiving requests not to; leaving written messages, objects, or unwanted gifts; vandalizing a person\xe2\x80\x99s property; photographing a person; and other threatening, intimidating or intrusive conduct.\nStalking may also involve the use of electronic media such as the internet, social networks, blogs, cell phones, texts, or other similar devices (often referred to as cyber-stalking). Such conduct may include, but is not limited to, non-consensual communication, telephone calls, voice messages, emails, texts, letters, notes, gifts, or any other communications that are repeated and undesired.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4 The Administration\n1.5 The Faculty\n1.6 Institute Councils and

Further definitions can be found on the\xc2\xa0Institute Discrimination &\xc2\xa0Harassment Response Office website.\nDomestic violence and dating violence by an MIT faculty, staff or other community member also violate this policy. Domestic violence and dating violence are defined on the\xc2\xa0Institute Discrimination &\xc2\xa0Harassment Response Office website.\nFurther definitions of Sexual Misconduct and Domestic Violence and Dating Violence, collectively Intimate Partner Violence, for members of the MIT community:\nSexual Misconduct Definitions\nDue to the sensitive and sometimes violent nature of incidents involving sexual misconduct, the following definitions are provided for informational use by members of the MIT community and for guidance in the investigation and processing of alleged violations. It is possible that a particular action may constitute sexual misconduct even if not specifically mentioned in these examples.\n1.\xc2\xa0Sexual Misconduct\nSexual misconduct is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors including sexual harassment, nonconsensual sexual contact, nonconsensual sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. This definition of sexual misconduct includes sexual assault (rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape) as defined by the Clery Act. The Clery Act is a federal law on campus safety and security \xe2\x80\x93 more information on the Clery Act can be found in MIT\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Annual Security Report.\nSexual misconduct can occur between individuals who know each other, individuals who do not know each other, individuals who have an established relationship, and individuals who have previously engaged in consensual sexual activity.\nSexual misconduct can be committed by persons of any gender identity, and it can occur between people of the same or different sex.\nUse of alcohol or other drugs will not excuse any behavior that violates this policy.\n2.\xc2\xa0Effective Consent\nMIT community members who engage in sexual behavior of any kind are expected to do so only with the effective consent of all parties involved. Doing otherwise constitutes sexual misconduct and is a violation of this policy.\nConsent is ultimately about respecting another\xe2\x80\x99s autonomy to make choices about their own body, their own boundaries, and their own behavior. The fundamental purpose of the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s sexual misconduct policy is to reinforce the expectation that individuals give and receive this respect in their sexual interactions.\nGiven the importance of sexual autonomy and the potential impact on those subjected to nonconsensual sexual activity, the Institute places the responsibility for obtaining effective consent on the person who initiates the sexual activity. That responsibility is significant.\nThe Institute recognizes that there are a wide variety of sexual interactions, that there is no single way to communicate consent, and that context matters. At all times, each party is free to choose where, when, and how they participate in sexual activity. Accordingly, when evaluating whether sexual activity was consensual, the Institute will consider the entirety of the sexual interaction and the relevant circumstances.\nEffective Consent is:\ninformed;\nfreely and voluntarily given;\n\xe2\x80\x8bmutually understandable words or actions\xc2\xa0which indicate willing participation in\xc2\xa0mutually agreed upon sexual activity.\nFurther:\nBy definition, effective consent cannot be obtained by\nunreasonable pressure, which can generally be understood as conduct that pressures another person to \xe2\x80\x9cgive in\xe2\x80\x9d to sexual activity rather than to choose freely to participate; factors that may be considered include (1) the frequency, nature, duration, and intensity of the requests for sexual activity; (2) whether and how previous requests were denied; and (3) whether the person initiating the sexual activity held a position of power over the other person;\nemotional intimidation, which can include (1) overtly degrading, humiliating, and shaming someone for not participating in sexual activity; (2) blackmail; and (3) threats to reputation;\nphysical intimidation and threats, which can be communicated by words or conduct, and\xc2\xa0physical force.\nEffective consent cannot be obtained from someone who is incapable of giving consent for any reason, including when:\nthe person has a mental, intellectual, or physical disability that causes the person to be temporarily or permanently unable to give consent;\nthe person is under the legal age to give consent;\nor\xc2\xa0the person is asleep, unconscious, physically helpless, or otherwise incapacitated, including by alcohol or other drugs.\nAn individual violates this policy if the individual initiates and engages in sexual activity with someone who is incapacitated, and (1) the individual knew the other person was incapacitated, or (2) a sober reasonable person under similar circumstances as the person initiating the sexual activity would have known the other person was incapacitated.\nFor purposes of this policy, silence and passivity\xc2\xa0do not\xc2\xa0signal consent.\nThere is no requirement that a person express non-consent or that they resist a sexual advance or request. For example, someone might not consent to sexual activity even though they do not say \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d or physically resist in any way.\xc2\xa0Physical or verbal resistance is evidence that there was not effective consent.\nSome behaviors and statements do not indicate consent, including the following:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\"Maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWithout more, ambiguous responses such as \xe2\x80\x9cuh huh\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmm hmm,\xe2\x80\x9d and giggling.\nA verbal \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d even if it may sound indecisive or insincere.\nMoving away.\n\xe2\x80\x8bA factor that may be considered when evaluating consent is whether, under similar circumstances as the person initiating the sexual activity, a sober reasonable person would have concluded that there was effective consent.\nIt is important for those who initiate sexual activity to understand that:\neven though someone gave effective consent to sexual activity in the past, that does not mean they have given effective consent to sexual activity in the future;\neven though someone gives effective consent to one type of sexual activity during a sexual interaction, that does not automatically mean they have given effective consent to other types of sexual activity;\neffective consent can be withdrawn at any time, and once a person withdraws effective consent, the other person must stop.\nEffective consent is clearest when obtained through direct communication about the decision to engage in specific sexual activity. Effective consent need not be verbal, but verbal communication is the most reliable and effective way to seek, assess, and obtain consent. Nonverbal communication can be ambiguous. For example, heavy breathing or moaning can be a sign of arousal, but it can also be a sign of distress. Talking with sexual partners about desires, intentions, boundaries, and limits can be uncomfortable, but it serves as a strong foundation for respectful, healthy, positive, and safe intimate relationships.\n3. Incapacitation\nIncapacitation is the physical and/or mental inability to make informed, rational judgments and decisions. Someone is incapacitated if they are asleep or unconscious. Someone can also be incapacitated by alcohol or other substances.\nBecause the impact of alcohol and other drugs varies from person to person, one should be cautious before engaging in sexual contact or intercourse when either person has been drinking alcohol or using other drugs. The use of alcohol or other drugs may create ambiguity about consent. If there is any doubt about either party\xe2\x80\x99s level of intoxication, the safe thing to do is to forgo all sexual activity.\nWhere alcohol or other substances are involved, incapacitation is determined by how the substance impacts a person\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make informed judgments. Incapacitation is a state beyond drunkenness or intoxication, and a person is not incapacitated merely because they have been drinking or using drugs.\nIncapacitation is not determined by technical or medical definitions. The question is whether a person has the physical and/or mental ability to make informed, rational judgments and decisions.\nAlthough each individual is different, there are some common and observable signs that someone is incapacitated or approaching incapacitation, including slurred or incomprehensible speech, unsteady gait, combativeness, emotional volatility, vomiting, or incontinence. A person who is incapacitated may not be able to understand or answer coherently some or all of the following questions:\nDo you know where you are?\nDo you know how you got here?\nDo you know what is happening?\nDo you know who you are with?\n4. Nonconsensual Sexual Penetration\nNonconsensual sexual penetration is the sexual penetration or attempted sexual penetration of any bodily opening with any object or body part without effective consent.\nNonconsensual sexual penetration includes the Clery Act definition of\xc2\xa0rape: the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim; the Clery Act definition of\xc2\xa0incest: sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law; and the Clery Act definition of\xc2\xa0statutory\xc2\xa0rape: sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent.\n5. Nonconsensual Sexual Contact\nNonconsensual sexual contact is any physical contact with another person of a sexual nature without effective consent, including touching someone\xe2\x80\x99s intimate parts (such as genitalia, groin, breast, or buttocks, either over or under clothing); touching a person with one\xe2\x80\x99s own intimate parts; or forcing a person to touch another\xe2\x80\x99s intimate parts.\nNonconsensual sexual contact includes the Clery Act definition of\xc2\xa0fondling: the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of their age or because of their temporary or permanent mental incapacity.\n6. Sexual Harassment\nSee P&P, Section 9.4.1.1\n7. Sexual Exploitation\nSexual exploitation means taking sexual advantage of another person and includes:\nProviding alcohol or other drugs to someone without that person\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, or unreasonably pressuring the person to consume alcohol or drugs, with the purpose of causing incapacitation in order for one to take sexual advantage of the person.\nRecording, photographing, transmitting, or allowing another to view images of private sexual activity and/or the intimate parts of another person without effective consent.\nAllowing third parties to observe private sexual acts without effective consent.\nVoyeurism, including by electronic means.\nIndecent exposure.\nKnowingly or recklessly exposing another person to a significant risk of sexually transmitted infection, including HIV, without their knowledge.\xe2\x80\x8b\nIntimate Partner Violence Definitions\nMIT prohibits intimate partner violence. Intimate Partner Violence is defined as actual or threatened physical violence, intimidation, or other forms of physical or sexual abuse directed toward a partner in an intimate relationship that would cause a reasonable person to fear harm to self or others. For this policy, \xe2\x80\x9cintimate relationship\xe2\x80\x9d means marriage, domestic partnership, engagement, casual or serious romantic involvement, and dating, whether current or former. Intimate Partner Violence can occur between persons of any gender identity, any sexual orientation, and it can occur in any type of intimate relationship including monogamous, non-committed, and relationships involving more than two partners. Intimate Partner Violence can be a single act or a pattern of behavior. Intimate Partner Violence also includes, without limitation, dating violence and domestic violence as defined by the Clery Act. (The Clery Act is a federal law on campus safety and security \xe2\x80\x93 more information can be found in MIT\xe2\x80\x99s Annual Security Report.)\nDating violence is defined as violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. The existence of such a relationship is determined based on the reporting party\xe2\x80\x99s statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. For the purposes of this definition, \xe2\x80\x9cdating violence\xe2\x80\x9d includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence.\nDomestic violence is defined as a felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or dating/domestic of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the victim as a spouse or dating/ domestic, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person\xe2\x80\x99s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred. To be considered domestic violence, the relationship must be more than just two people living together as roommates.\nIntimate Partner Violence can take many forms. Examples include, but are not limited to, situations in which the following behaviors are directed toward a partner in a current or former intimate relationship: hitting, kicking, punching, strangling, or other violence; property damage; and threat of violence to one\xe2\x80\x99s self, one\xe2\x80\x99s partner, or the family members, friends, pets, or personal property of the partner.\nSubmit an Incident Report\nMIT encourages individuals to seek assistance for incidents of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\nEmergency Contact\nMIT Police: 617-253-1212\nUrgent Care: 617-253-4481\nDean on Call: 617-253-1212*\n*Dean on Call reached via MIT Police\nInstitute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n120 Massachusetts Avenue, W31-310, Cambridge, MA 02139\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nQuick Exit'"];

See the update history page for more information.\n7.1. Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action and Serious Search\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in education and employment. Through its Affirmative Action program, the Institute seeks to expand its efforts to guarantee equality of opportunity in employment and to reduce underrepresentation and underutilization of minorities, women, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities at MIT. The Institute\'s Affirmative Action Serious Search policy is a means both to further its commitment to equal opportunity and to fulfill its legal obligations of affirmative action.\nMIT\'s policy on nondiscrimination is at Section 9.3 and its policy on non-retaliation is at Section 9.7.\n7.1.1 Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action\nThe Institute\'s objective for its workforce is to achieve a representation of women, minorities, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities that is at least in proportion to their current availability in the relevant field, and to provide them with new opportunities for career development. See Section 7.1.2.\nMIT\'s obligations as a federal contractor include the development of an affirmative action program which provides for analysis of utilization of minorities, women, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities in all job groups in each organizational unit. The Institute\'s Affirmative Action Plan may be reviewed for further understanding of the responsibilities assigned and the procedures developed to carry out the Institute\'s equal opportunity policy. The Serious Search policy, below, is one method of implementing MIT\'s commitment to affirmative action.\n7.1.2 Affirmative Action Serious Search Policy\nAs part of its commitment to affirmative action, the Institute requires a thorough search of the relevant employment market for qualified candidates, including women, minority candidates, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities for its faculty and most other salaried positions.\nMIT\'s affirmative action serious search policy requires that:\nOpen positions be posted\nFor faculty searches, a person must serve as the equal opportunity representative for each search; this step is recommended for staff searches\nA search plan be written and approved before a position is posted, and\nA search report be submitted and approved before a job offer is made\nThe details of the process vary somewhat between searches for faculty and senior research scientists, engineers, and associates, and other salaried positions covered by this policy.\nEven where a serious search is not required under this policy, such as for certain positions or for part-time staff, the Institute encourages departments, labs, and centers to consider additional avenues to encourage applications from women, minorities, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities, particularly where some or all of those groups are not well represented in that unit.\n7.1.2.1 Positions Covered by the Serious Search Process\nFaculty and Senior Research Scientists, Engineers, and Associates\nSalaried appointments for nine \xc2\xa0months or longer to the Faculty require a serious search: assistant professor, associate professor without tenure, associate professor with tenure, full professor. For coaching positions, the following also require a serious search: assistant professor/coach, associate professor/coach, associate professor/senior coach. Promotions of MIT faculty into these positions generally do not require a search, with the exception of promotions into the first step in the tenure track or professorial promotion ladder.\nFull-time appointments as Senior Research Scientists, Senior Research Engineers, and Senior Research Associates generally follow the same Serious Search process as faculty appointments.\nOther Salaried Appointments\nThis policy also applies to full-time salaried appointments for nine months or longer to the following employment categories:\nAll campus sponsored research staff ranks (principal research scientist/engineer/associate; research scientist/engineer/associate; research specialist, technical associate; sponsored research technical staff; research administrators). Note that Lincoln Laboratory staff are excluded from the Serious Search policy and covered by a different search process approved by the Vice President for Research.\nSome academic instructional staff ranks (instructor, technical instructor, senior technical instructor, instructor/coach; lecturer, senior lecturer); and\nAdministrative staff (including medical staff).\nIf one of the positions covered by this policy changes from part-time to full-time, a Serious Search must be done at that time.\n7.1.2.2 Waivers of Search; Promotions\nWaivers\nA waiver of search is granted only if unusual circumstances justify the waiver.\nA request to waive the posting of a specific job or to waive the search process after a job has been posted may be granted only by the Provost for any faculty or senior researcher search, and by the relevant Academic Council member or their designee for all other searches.\nThe fact that a search was waived must be noted in the system of record for the individual hired. Documentation of the request and approval of the waiver must be retained by the approver or their designee.\nPromotions\nPromotions of current faculty or staff into positions covered by this policy are excluded from the serious search policy in the following cases:\nPromotions of faculty and academic instructional staff into a higher rank of their current job (such as assistant professor to associate professor, instructor to technical instructor) are covered by specific promotion criteria and are not subject to serious search\nPromotions of administrative and sponsored research staff are not subject to serious search if:\nThe staff member\'s job is reclassified into a job that more accurately reflects their current duties\nThe staff member is promoted to a position in which significant duties are added to their current duties\nHowever, if a vacant position is being filled, this promotion exception does not apply and a serious search is required (unless a waiver is granted)\nFor other promotions, a serious search is generally required for positions covered by this policy; a waiver of search may be requested in unusual circumstances.\n7.1.3 Search Process for Faculty Searches\nAdditional information on the process for faculty searches is set forth at Section 3.1 and at Section 5.3.1 for principal research scientists, engineers and associates.\n7.1.3.1 Search Plan\nAt the time a search is begun for a faculty position, the department head will submit to the Dean or designee for approval a search plan for the position. The search plan must specify the qualifications being sought, a brief description of the search process, the specific steps by which active efforts will be made to identify candidates who are minorities, women, protected veterans, or individuals with disabilities. Recommended steps for outreach can be found on the Human Resources website on Hiring at MIT.\nOnce the search plan is approved, the department head must ensure that at least one member of the search committee is assigned the specific responsibility as an \xe2\x80\x9cequal opportunity representative\xe2\x80\x9d to see that a serious search is carried out. The equal opportunity representative may be on the search committee or someone outside the committee, such as a departmental human resources professional; the equal opportunity representative serves, ex officio, as a member of each search committee that is formed.\nThe equal opportunity representative will review the composition of the pool of candidates at least one time during the search, and inform the department head of the results of the review of the pool. The department head may take or request that additional steps be taken, or may encourage exploration of other ways to strengthen the search process. The equal opportunity representative may consult with the School\'s Affirmative Action administrator, and share relevant information with the search committee. See the Human Resources website on Hiring at MIT for more information on the role of the equal opportunity representative.\nSearches for Senior Research Scientists/Engineers/Associate appointments follow the same process as above, except that the process may be initiated by the director of a research unit.\n7.1.3.2 Search Report\nAt the conclusion of a search, and before an offer is approved by the Dean or designee, the department head must submit to the Dean or designee a report on the results of the search. The report must contain a description of:\nThe title, department, and a reference to the approved search plan, including special steps taken to locate minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans.\nThe selection process, including the number of applicants and the number of minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans and their ranking, if ranked.\nFor the proposed candidate and any other candidates who met with the whole search committee:\nTheir name\nAccess to their curriculum vitae (CV) and other application materials\nA notation whether they are a woman, minority, veteran, or individual with disabilities\nSpecific reasons the candidate was selected or not selected, referencing the stated position requirements\nIf a candidate was offered the position but declined, their reasons for declining\nThe Dean or designee must approve the search report before the offer is made. A copy of the approved search report for faculty must be sent to the Office of the Provost.\n7.1.4. Search Process for Non-Faculty Salaried Appointments\nThe following process is used for salaried appointments listed in Section 7.1.2.1 other than Faculty and Senior Research Scientists, Senior Research Engineers, and Senior Research Associates.\n7.1.4.1 Search Plan\nAt the time a search is begun, the hiring manager will submit a search plan for the position to the appropriate Academic Council member or their designee. The search plan must include the job description with qualifications being sought, a brief description of the search process, the specific steps by which active efforts will be made to identify candidates who are minorities, women, protected veterans, or individuals with disabilities. Recommended steps for outreach can be found on the Human Resources website on Hiring at MIT. The search plan must be approved before the job is posted.\nOnce a search plan is approved, the search may be conducted directly by the hiring manager or by another staff member; some searches use a search committee for all or part of the search. The hiring manager should ensure that a person is assigned the specific responsibility as an \"equal opportunity representative\" to see that an active search is carried out. The hiring manager may play this role, or a member of a search committee if one is formed, or another staff member designated.\nThe equal opportunity representative will review the composition of the pool at least one time during the search, and inform the hiring manager of the results of the review of the pool. The hiring manager may take or request that additional steps be taken, or encourage exploration of other ways to strengthen the search process. The equal opportunity representative may consult with the Affirmative Action administrator of the area, and share relevant information with the search committee.\n7.1.4.2 Search Report\nAt the conclusion of a search, and before an offer is approved, the hiring manager or departmental Human Resources representative must submit a report on the results of the search to the appropriate member of Academic Council or designee. The report must contain a description of:\nThe position and a reference to the approved search plan, including special steps taken to locate minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans.\nThe selection process, including the number of applicants and the number of minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans and their ranking, if ranked.\nA description of the pool of applicants and other relevant demographic data on the search process.\nFor the successful candidate and all other finalists:\nTheir name\nAccess to their resume and other application materials,\nA notation whether they are a woman, minority, veteran, or individual with disabilities\nThe specific reasons the candidate was selected and not selected, referencing the stated position requirements\nIf a candidate was offered the position but declined, their reasons for declining\nThe member of Academic Council or designee must approve the search report before the offer is made.\n7.1.5 Reporting on Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action\nThe Provost reports annually to the faculty on faculty and graduate student diversity, and also presents this information to Academic Council and other appropriate committees or groups. In addition, the Provost and the Vice President for Human Resources report annually about staff diversity to Academic Council and other committees or groups.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The

See the update history page for more information.\nInstitute and federal policies prohibit the acceptance of personal gifts or gratuities from vendors, subcontractors, and contractors (referred to in this section as \"suppliers\").\nIt is the Institute\'s objective to award business to suppliers on the basis of considerations such as quality, service, competitive pricing, and technical abilities. Acceptance of personal gifts or gratuities from suppliers that could be construed as a means of inducing business with the Institute is totally inconsistent with this objective.\nInstitute policy prohibits Institute employees from accepting personal gifts or gratuities of any kind from suppliers. This includes the use of property or facilities, gift certificates, entertainment, or other favors of value extended to employees or their families.\nFederal regulations, which govern procurement under contracts and grants, impose a like prohibition mandated by Public Law 99-634, known as the \"Anti-Kickback Enforcement Act of 1986.\" \"Kickback\" is defined as any money, fee, commission, credit, gift, gratuity, thing of value, or compensation of any kind that is provided by a supplier, directly or indirectly, to any employee for the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable treatment in connection with procurement under a federal contract or grant.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4

See the update history page for more information.\nThe Institute's nondiscrimination policy applies to faculty, staff, students and all other members of the MIT community. It is included in the MIT Bulletin (course catalog) and in other publications describing MIT's academic programs.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in education and employment. The Institute prohibits discrimination against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, employment policies, scholarship and loan programs, and other Institute administered programs and activities; the Institute may, however, favor US citizens or residents in admissions and financial aid.*\nThe Vice President for Human Resources is designated as the Institute's Equal Opportunity Officer. Inquiries concerning the Institute's policies, compliance with applicable laws, statutes, and regulations, and complaints may be directed to Ramona Allen,\xc2\xa0Vice President\xc2\xa0for Human Resources, Building NE49-5000, 617-324-5675.\xc2\xa0In addition, inquiries about Title IX (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex) may be directed to the Institute's Title IX Coordinator, Sarah Rankin, Room W31-223, 617-324-7526, titleIX@mit.edu. Information about the grievance\xc2\xa0procedures and process for discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including how to report or file a complaint of sex discrimination, how to report or file a formal complaint of sexual harassment, and how MIT will respond is available at\xc2\xa0idhr.mit.edu. Inquiries about the laws and about compliance may also be directed to the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Region I, 5 Post Office Square, 8th Floor, Boston, MA 02109-3921, 617-289-0111,\xc2\xa0OCR.Boston@ed.gov.\n*The ROTC programs at MIT are operated under Department of Defense (DoD) policies and regulations, and do not comply fully with MIT's policy of nondiscrimination with regard to gender identity. MIT continues to advocate for a change in DoD policies and regulations concerning gender identity, and is committed to providing alternative financial assistance under a needs-based assessment to any MIT student who loses ROTC financial aid because of these DoD policies and regulations.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The

See the update history page for more information.\nIn order to create a respectful, welcoming and productive community, the Institute is committed to providing a living, working and learning environment that is free from harassment.\nHarassment is defined as unwelcome conduct of a verbal, nonverbal or physical nature that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a work or academic environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile or abusive and that adversely affects an individual\xe2\x80\x99s educational, work, or living environment.\nIn determining whether unwelcome conduct is harassing, the Institute will examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the conduct, including its frequency, nature and severity, the relationship between the parties and the context in which the conduct occurred. Below is a partial list of examples of conduct that would likely be considered harassing, followed by a partial list of examples that would likely not constitute harassment:\nExamples of possibly harassing conduct: Public and personal tirades; deliberate and repeated humiliation; deliberate interference with the life or work of another person; the use of certain racial epithets; deliberate desecration of religious articles or places; repeated insults about loss of personal and professional competence based on age.\nExamples of conduct that is likely not harassment: Administrative actions like performance reviews (including negative performance reviews) and making work assignments; other work-related decisions like moving work areas or changing work colleagues; and isolated incidents (unless, as noted above, they are very severe, such as the use of certain racial epithets).\nInformation on different ways to raise concerns about harassment can be found on the Complaint Process and Resolution website.\nConduct that does not rise to the level of harassment may still violate Section 9.2. Even conduct that does not violate an MIT policy may be inappropriate and any inappropriate conduct should be addressed by the supervisor or department head.\nWhile MIT\xe2\x80\x99s harassment policy is not limited to harassment based on the protected categories listed in Section 9.3, the Institute is particularly committed to eliminating harassment based on those categories. Harassment that is based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin is not only a violation of MIT policy but may also violate federal and state law, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Mass. General Laws Chapter 151B.\xc2\xa0 For information on how to file complaints of violation of law with governmental agencies see Section 9.8.5.9 Legal Information.\n9.5.1 Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, Gender-Based Harassment, Title IX Sexual Harassment\nThe Institute\xe2\x80\x99s policy against harassment specifically includes a prohibition against sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender-based harassment if the conduct meets the standards of harassment set forth above and has a connection to MIT as described in Section 9.1.\xc2\xa0 Additional guidance is set forth on the Institute Discrimination &\xc2\xa0Harassment Response Office website.\nIn addition, special procedures apply to formal complaints of sexual harassment covered under Title IX Sexual Harassment as defined in Section 9.5.1.4.\n9.5.1.1 Sexual Harassment\nSexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when:\nSubmission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s employment or academic standing; or\nSubmission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for significant employment decisions (such as advancement, performance evaluation, or work schedule) or academic decisions (such as grading or letters of recommendation) affecting that individual; or\nThe conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would consider it intimidating, hostile or abusive and it adversely affects an individual\xe2\x80\x99s educational, work, or living environment.\nA partial list of examples of conduct that might be deemed to constitute sexual harassment if sufficiently severe or pervasive include:\nExamples of verbal sexual harassment may include unwelcome conduct such as sexual flirtation, advances or propositions or requests for sexual activity or dates; asking about someone else\'s sexual activities, fantasies, preferences, or history; discussing one\xe2\x80\x99s own sexual activities, fantasies, preferences, or history;\xc2\xa0verbal abuse of a sexual nature; suggestive comments; sexually explicit jokes; turning discussions at work or in the academic environment to sexual topics;\xc2\xa0and making offensive sounds such as \"wolf whistles.\nExamples of nonverbal sexual harassment may include unwelcome conduct such as displaying sexual objects, pictures or other images; invading a person\'s personal body space, such as standing closer than appropriate or necessary or hovering; displaying or wearing objects or items of clothing which express sexually offensive content; making sexual gestures with hands or body movements; looking at a person in a sexually suggestive or intimidating manner; or delivering\xc2\xa0unwanted letters, gifts, or other items of a sexual nature.\n9.5.1.2 Sexual Misconduct\nSexual misconduct is a broad term that includes sexual assault (rape, sexual fondling, incest or statutory rape) as well sexual exploitation and sexual harassment. Further definitions can be found on the Institute Discrimination &\xc2\xa0Harassment Response Office website.\nDomestic violence and dating violence by an MIT faculty, staff or other community member also violate this policy. Domestic violence and dating violence are defined on the Institute Discrimination &\xc2\xa0Harassment Response Office website.\n9.5.1.3 Gender-Based Harassment\nGender-based harassment is unwelcome verbal or nonverbal conduct based on gender, sex, sex-stereotyping, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy that meets the definitions above of harassment. Gender-based harassment may also involve conduct of a sexual nature.\n9.5.1.4\xc2\xa0Title IX Sexual Harassment\nAlthough MIT broadly prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of sexual misconduct, federal Title IX regulations require MIT to follow specific processes when the Institute has actual knowledge of a report of certain categories of sexual misconduct, referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX Sexual Harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTitle IX Sexual Harassment means: Conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:\nAn employee of MIT conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of MIT on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;\nUnwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to MIT\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity; or\n\xe2\x80\x9cSexual assault,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdating violence,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic violence,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstalking,\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by federal law and set out on the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR) website.\nMIT must follow the specific processes cited below when it receives a formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment and where all of the following apply:\nAt the time of filing a formal complaint, the Complainant was/is participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity at MIT;\nThe alleged conduct occurred in an education program or activity controlled by MIT; and\nThe alleged conduct occurred against a person in the United States.\nInformation about MIT\xe2\x80\x99s processes for responding to reports of Title IX Sexual Harassment is available here.\xc2\xa0 Formal Complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment are investigated in accordance with the IDHR Investigation Guide and hearings are held in accordance with the process available here\xc2\xa0 for complaints against a faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) and in the Title IX Sexual Harassment Hearing Procedures in the Committee on Discipline Rules for complaints against students.\nFormal Complaints of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct that do not meet the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment are addressed under the complaint resolution process described in Section 9.8 for complaints against a faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) and in the Sexual Misconduct Hearing Procedures (Non-Title IX Sexual Harassment) in the Committee on Discipline Rules for complaints against students.\nMIT prohibits retaliation as set forth in Section 9.7 and the Mind and Handbook. In the context of Title IX Sexual Harassment, this means that: No person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual:\nfor the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX, or\nbecause the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in a Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation, proceeding, or hearing.\nIn addition, retaliation also includes intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX.\nClick here for additional definitions relevant to this Title IX Sexual Harassment policy.\n9.5.1.5\xc2\xa0Notification of Allegations of Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment of Students\nAny MIT employee (including faculty and staff) who is informed of an allegation of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct involving an MIT student must promptly notify the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office (IDHR) of the allegation. Graduate resident advisors, teaching assistants, and other students with advising or teaching responsibilities have this obligation to disclose when they are informed of an allegation due to their respective role, by notifying IDHR. Note that, as defined above, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct are broad terms and include dating and domestic violence as well as stalking.\nStaff who are designated as Confidential Resources do not have this obligation to disclose.\nSee Section 7.3.1 about responsibilities of supervisors to report certain allegations made against employees.\n9.5.2 Stalking\nStalking, whether or not sexual in nature, is prohibited by MIT. \xc2\xa0Stalking is defined as engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others, or to suffer substantial emotional distress.\nStalking can take many forms. Examples include, but are not limited to, two or more instances of the following conduct (that also meet the definition of stalking above): following a person; appearing at a person\xe2\x80\x99s home, class, or work; continuing to contact a person after receiving requests not to; leaving written messages, objects, or unwanted gifts; vandalizing a person\xe2\x80\x99s property; photographing a person; and other threatening, intimidating or intrusive conduct.\nStalking may also involve the use of electronic media such as the internet, social networks, blogs, cell phones, texts, or other similar devices (often referred to as cyber-stalking). Such conduct may include, but is not limited to, non-consensual communication, telephone calls, voice messages, emails, texts, letters, notes, gifts, or any other communications that are repeated and undesired.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4 The Administration\n1.5 The Faculty\n1.6 Institute Councils and

See the update history page for more information.\nMIT is committed to providing a prompt, fair and impartial process, with informal and formal options, to address concerns of harassment, discrimination, or other inappropriate conduct prohibited by MIT policy. The goals of the complaint resolution process are to stop inappropriate conduct, to respond effectively to allegations of inappropriate conduct, and to restore a productive and welcoming working or learning environment.\n9.8.1 Application of Policy\nThe complaint resolution process described in Section 9.8 is available for any complaint by an MIT community member that an MIT faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) engaged in conduct that violates any of the following \xe2\x80\x9cConduct Policies:\xe2\x80\x9d\nDiscrimination or Discriminatory Harassment\nHarassment when the alleged conduct is based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s protected class as defined in Section 9.3 (Section 9.5)\nNondiscrimination (Section 9.3)\nRacist Conduct (Section 9.4)\nRetaliation when the alleged conduct is based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s protected class as defined in Section 9.3 (Section 9.7)\nViolence against Community Members (Section 9.6) based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s protected class\nOther Inappropriate Conduct\nHarassment not based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s protected class (Section 9.5)\nPersonal Conduct and Responsibilities Towards Students and Employees (Section 9.2)\nIntroduction to\xc2\xa0Relations and Responsibilities Within the MIT Community (Section 9.1)\nRetaliation not based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s protected class (Section 9.7)\nViolence against Community Members (Section 9.6) not based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s protected class\nWhile non-MIT community members may not file a Complaint, the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response office may file an Administrative Complaint (defined below) for allegations brought by a non-MIT community member that an MIT faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar violated one or more Conduct Policies.\nThis complaint resolution process is not for complaints against students. Complaints against students follow the procedures set forth in the Mind and Hand Book Section VI and the Committee on Discipline rules, unless a student is alleged to have violated one of MIT\xe2\x80\x99s Conduct Policies while primarily acting in a capacity where they are paid by MIT for their services. Also, this process generally does not apply to complaints against affiliates or other unpaid members of the MIT community (other than complaints against postdoctoral fellows).\nThis process does not apply to complaints about academic decisions (such as grade appeals, thesis issues, or authorship issues), allegations of research or academic misconduct, and to any other allegations where other internal complaint handling procedures have been established by MIT. This policy also does not apply to reviews of conduct where a Complaint has not been filed, such as a review initiated by manager or supervisor.\nFor any complaint made against an MIT faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar that does not allege violation of a Conduct Policy, MIT will determine the process for review of the complaint on a case-by-case basis. In any formal investigation, the steps in Section 9.8.4.2 are usually followed.\nProcedures for reporting Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, and stalking, are available on the Institute Discrimination & Harassment website. Information on formal complaint processes can also be found on the IDHR\xc2\xa0website.\n9.8.2 Definitions\nComplaint: A written statement filed online\xc2\xa0or with the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response office alleging a violation of one of the Conduct Policies. \xc2\xa0A Complaint may be filed by any member of the MIT community.\nComplainant: The faculty, student, staff, or other member of the MIT community who files a Complaint.\nAdministrative Complaint: A Complaint filed by the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response office where a concern is raised by a non-MIT community member or by an MIT community member who does not want to be a Complainant, and where, in the judgment of the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response office, the concern warrants investigation.\nRespondent: The MIT faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar who is alleged to have violated one of the Conduct Policies.\nFaculty Panel: \xc2\xa0A panel of three tenured faculty members who determine whether there is a violation of a Conduct Policy when the Respondent is a faculty member, a senior research scientist, senior research engineer, or senior research associate. The three faculty members serving on a particular Faculty Panel are selected by the Associate Provost.\n9.8.3 Informal Options for Resolving Complaints\nWhen appropriate and possible, faculty, supervisors, managers and other employees are encouraged to talk directly with one another about any concerns, with the goal of understanding perspectives and resolving differences. Supervisors are encouraged to address concerns informally, and as early as possible\xc2\xa0(see\xc2\xa0Section 7.3.1). Employees may also seek assistance from the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response office (IDHR), a human resources professional in their department, lab, or center or in the Human Resources office, or from an MIT Ombudsperson to informally resolve a concern.\nIn some cases, a more structured informal process may be selected by the Complainant and the Respondent. This may include facilitation of an agreement between the parties, individual or group educational or training programs, and coaching or counseling assistance. This type of informal resolution may be conducted with the assistance of the IDHR, a human resources professional in the department, lab or center, the Ombuds Office, or the Human Resources office. As part of this more structured process, there may be factual inquiries to assist in informally resolving the concern. Any resolution resulting from this process is documented by the IDHR (with the exception of resolutions resulting from work with the Ombuds Office, which does not generate records).\nWith all informal resolution options, no determination is made as to whether a Conduct Policy was violated.\nAt any time, either the Complainant or the Respondent may end any attempt at informal resolution of a Complaint, in which case the formal investigation process begins or resumes under Section 9.8.4. The IDHR office may also decide that a Complaint needs to be formally investigated even if both Complainant and the Respondent wish to resolve the matter informally.\nSee the IDHR website\xc2\xa0or HR website for more information.\n9.8.4 Investigation of Complaints\n9.8.4.1\xc2\xa0 Filing and Initial Assessment of a Complaint\nAny member of the MIT community may file a Complaint online or with the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office (IDHR) to initiate an investigation of an alleged violation of a Conduct Policy.\nThe Complainant is encouraged to file a Complaint as soon as possible after the offending conduct occurred. Although MIT does not impose a specific time limit for reviewing a Complaint, the Institute can respond more effectively to a Complaint that is filed while the underlying facts are recent. In its discretion, the IDHR may decide not to undertake an investigation due to the passage of time.\nWhen a Complaint is filed, the IDHR does an initial assessment of the Complaint to determine whether the behavior would violate a Conduct Policy, assuming for purposes of this analysis that the factual allegations contained in the Complaint are true. If the IDHR determines that:\nThe Complaint does not state a violation of a Conduct Policy, the IDHR closes the Complaint.\nThe Complaint states a violation of a Conduct Policy in the category of Discrimination or Discriminatory Harassment (see Section 9.8.1), the IDHR will begin an investigation of the Complaint or attempt informal resolution.\nThe Complaint states a violation of a Conduct Policy in the category of Other Inappropriate Conduct (see Section 9.8.1), the Complaint is referred to the Human Resources office to begin an investigation or attempt informal resolution.\nThe IDHR will inform the Complainant of its initial assessment decision. The IDHR\xe2\x80\x99s initial assessment decision is final and cannot be appealed.\n9.8.4.2 Investigation Process\nThe formal Investigation Process includes the following steps:\nThe Complainant and Respondent are notified in writing of the name of the investigator, the nature of the allegations, and a summary of the process that will be followed.\xc2\xa0 A copy of the written notification is also provided to the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor or manager.\nThe Complainant and Respondent meet separately with the investigator and provide any information they would like the investigator to consider.\nThe investigator may interview witnesses, collect other information, and consult with other individuals or offices, all as the investigator deems appropriate.\nThe Complainant and the Respondent have an opportunity to review a draft investigation report and provide comments to the investigator.\nThe investigator uses a preponderance of the evidence standard (\xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not\xe2\x80\x9d) in drafting the investigation report.\nInvestigations are usually completed within 75 calendar days from the date the investigation begins. See IDHR\xc2\xa0website for more information.\n9.8.4.3\xc2\xa0Findings and Discipline \xe2\x80\x93 Faculty Members, Senior Research Scientists, Senior Research Engineers, and Senior Research Associates\nIf the Respondent is a faculty member, senior research scientist, senior research engineer, or senior research associate, the investigator investigates and prepares a report with findings of fact and a recommendation as to whether the Respondent violated any Conduct Policy. The report is provided to a Faculty Panel. The Faculty Panel may meet or consult with the investigator or others but generally does not meet with the Complainant or the Respondent. The Faculty Panel decides if the Respondent violated one or more of the Conduct Policies.\nIf the Faculty Panel decides that the Respondent violated a Conduct Policy, the Faculty Panel recommends to the appropriate Dean (or other Academic Council member for some senior research scientists, engineers, and associates) what action should be taken in light of the finding. Examples of discipline include, but are not limited to, a reprimand (oral or written), a suspension, a salary reduction, a demotion, a removal of privileges, or termination of employment or appointment. See Section 3.4.2 Faculty Misconduct or Performance Below Standards regarding discipline for tenured faculty.\nThe Dean reviews the recommendation from the Faculty Panel and determines what discipline will be imposed or other action taken. If the Dean disagrees with the Panel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, the Dean must meet with the Faculty Panel to discuss. If the Dean continues to disagree with the Faculty Panel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation after that discussion, the Dean must inform the Provost in writing of the reason(s) for their disagreement on discipline. In such cases, the Provost will make the final decision on discipline and will inform the Dean and the Faculty Panel of the decision.\nThe investigation report and the Faculty Panel\xe2\x80\x99s determination regarding any policy violation are confidentially shared with the Complainant, the Respondent, and the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor and/or higher level manager. If the Faculty Panel determines that the Respondent violated a Conduct Policy, the report and conclusions are also sent to the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s department/unit head and to the Dean of the unit in which the Respondent works.\nThe Respondent and the IDHR are provided written notice of any discipline. The Complainant is not generally provided with information about the discipline issued unless the discipline directly affects the Complainant, such as a \xe2\x80\x9cno contact\xe2\x80\x9d order. However, in cases alleging a violation of Section 9.5.1 Sexual Harassment, Section 9.5.1.2 Sexual Misconduct, Section 9.5.1.3\xc2\xa0Gender-Based Harassment, Section 9.5.1.4 Title IX Sexual Harassment, or\xc2\xa0Section 9.5.2 Stalking, the Complainant and Respondent receive simultaneous notification in writing of the result of the investigation (including discipline), procedures for appeal (if applicable), any change to the result, and when the results become final.\nDecisions on discipline are final and cannot be appealed.\n9.8.4.4\xc2\xa0Findings and Discipline - Staff Members and Postdoctoral Scholars\nIf the Respondent is a staff member or postdoctoral scholar, the investigator investigates and prepares a report with findings of fact and a determination as to whether a Conduct Policy was violated. The report is confidentially shared with the Complainant, the Respondent, and the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor and/or higher level manager. If the investigator determines that the Respondent violated a Conduct Policy, the report is also sent to the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s department/unit head and to the appropriate Dean or other Academic Council member of the unit in which the Respondent works.\nThe Dean or other Academic Council member will determine the appropriate action to take against the Respondent. This may include, but is not limited to, a reprimand (oral or written), suspension, a salary reduction, a demotion, a removal of privileges, or termination of employment or appointment.\nThe Respondent and the IDHR are provided written notice of any discipline. The Complainant is not generally provided with information about any discipline issued unless the discipline directly affects the Complainant, such as a \xe2\x80\x9cno contact\xe2\x80\x9d order. However, in cases alleging a violation of Section 9.4.1 Sexual Harassment, Section 9.5.1.2 Sexual Misconduct, Section 9.5.1.3 Gender-Based Harassment, Section 9.5.1.4 Title IX Sexual Harassment, or\xc2\xa0Section 9.5.2 Stalking, the Complainant and Respondent both receive written notice of the result of the investigation (including the discipline), procedures for appeal (if applicable), any change to the result, and when the results become final.\nDecisions on discipline are final and cannot be appealed.\n9.8.4.5 Appeals\nEither the Complainant or the Respondent may appeal a finding as to whether a policy violation occurred. Neither party may appeal a decision on discipline or other action taken. An appeal must be filed in writing with the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response office within 21 calendar days of the date of the written notice of the decision as to whether a policy violation occurred. \xc2\xa0An appeal is limited to one or more of the following grounds:\nNew significant information: There exists significant, substantive, and relevant information that was not available at the time of the decision.\nMaterial procedural issue: There was a substantial departure from the procedures in Section 9.8 that significantly affected the outcome.\nMaterial finding against the weight of evidence: A material finding that formed a basis for the decision by the investigator or Faculty Panel was substantially against the weight of the evidence.\nAppeals are decided as follows:\nThe Provost decides appeals on cases in which the Respondent is a faculty member, senior research scientist/engineer/associate, principal research scientist/engineer/associate, research scientist/engineer/associate, or Academic Instructional staff. However, if the Provost made the decision on discipline due to disagreement between the Faculty Panel and the Dean, the President will decide the appeal.\nThe Vice President for Research or the Provost decides appeals on cases in which the Respondent is a postdoctoral scholar.\nThe Executive Vice President and Treasurer decides appeals on cases in which the Respondent is another category of employee.\nBoth the Complainant and the Respondent will be informed in writing of the decision on the appeal. The decision on an appeal is final. Generally, the decision on an appeal is made within 30 calendar days from the date the appeal was submitted.\n9.8.5 Provisions Common to Section 9.8\nThe following provisions apply to all complaints or concerns raised under Section 9.8, whether using an informal resolution option or a formal investigation.\n9.8.5.1 Interim and Supportive Measures\nThe Institute will offer reasonable and appropriate measures if needed for the Complainant and Respondent to facilitate their continued employment or education during any informal resolution process and during an investigation. These measures may be remedial or protective, such as a no-contact order, change in work schedule or location, or placement of the Respondent on administrative leave during the Complaint review process. Additional information about supportive measures in Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment matters can be found on the IDHR website.\n9.8.5.2 False Accusations or Testimony\nA false Complaint determined by the Institute to have been made in bad faith and any dishonesty in the context of an investigation or other review are serious offenses. Such offenses may be investigated and may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or other affiliation with MIT. False accusations, false testimony, or dishonesty by a student in the course of the complaint process will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct.\n9.8.5.3 Confidentiality and Privacy\nMIT recognizes that many participants in the Section 9.8 Complaint Resolution process may wish that these matters remain confidential and want the Institute to protect the privacy of all involved, to the extent possible. MIT also recognizes that participants may need or wish to disclose information related to matters resolved under Section 9.8.3 Informal Options for Resolving Complaints, or Section 9.8.4 Investigation of Complaints. MIT seeks to balance these competing interests to encourage parties and witnesses to participate in the process to ensure its integrity and to resolve the issues without undue disruption. To meet these competing interests:\nMIT expects the parties to maintain the confidentiality of an ongoing Section 9.8 Complaint Resolution process, except as necessary to gather and present relevant evidence.\nMIT prohibits the parties from distributing, in any form or by any medium, documents (which include emails) obtained in the course of their participation in a Section 9.8 Complaint Resolution process\xe2\x80\x94including but not limited to, the complaint, interview transcripts and summaries, and the investigative record and report\xe2\x80\x94other than for the purpose of consulting with their advisor, or as part of a civil, criminal, or administrative legal proceeding.\nIn certain circumstances, disclosing information about a Section 9.8 Complaint Resolution process may be construed as retaliation or harassment in violation of MIT policy. Participants should keep in mind that any action that would discourage a reasonable person from participating in an informal or formal complaint or investigation process may be construed as retaliation.\nParticipants should also keep in mind that during the investigation of a Section 9.8 Complaint, disclosure of information about the matter by the parties or any witnesses has the potential to compromise the integrity of the investigation.\nOnce a Section 9.8 Complaint Resolution process is complete, the parties are not prohibited from sharing the determination as to whether a Conduct Policy was violated; however, MIT nonetheless strongly encourages all parties to be thoughtful about whether they share information and to be mindful of the prohibitions against retaliation and harassment as noted above.\nThe Institute will take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of proceedings under Section 9.8 and records created or collected during any Section 9.8 Complaint Resolution process. MIT will communicate information regarding a Section 9.8 Complaint Resolution process\xe2\x80\x94including: interim measures; an informal resolution under Section 9.8.3; or the findings of fact, determination as to whether a Conduct Policy was violated, and discipline under Section 9.8.4\xe2\x80\x94to individuals at MIT only on a legitimate need-to-know basis, as required by law, or in appropriate circumstances as determined by senior administrators.\xc2\xa0 In addition, in some matters, MIT may be obligated to notify agencies or research sponsors about certain violations of MIT\xe2\x80\x99s policies on harassment or discrimination.\n9.8.5.4 Assistance During the Complaint Resolution Process\nAll parties involved in a dispute are encouraged to seek assistance from resources at the Institute such as their departmental human resources professional, their human resources officer, ombudspersons, or other departmental managers.\nDuring an informal resolution process or during a formal investigation, both the Complainant and the Respondent may be accompanied by a member of the MIT community to any meeting about the Complaint. These individuals may not be family members, subordinates, or attorneys (except as noted below), although parties may, of course, consult with an attorney or other advisor on their own before or after any meeting at MIT. \xc2\xa0In cases alleging a violation of Section 9.5.1 Sexual Harassment, Section 9.5.2.1 Sexual Misconduct, Section 9.5.1.3 Gender-Based Harassment, Section 9.5.1.4 Title IX Sexual Harassment, or\xc2\xa0Section 9.5.2 Stalking, the parties may have an advisor who is an attorney or person outside the MIT community, as long as that person is not a witness or party to the Complaint.\nIn cases of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence or stalking, the parties may have an advisor who is an attorney or person outside the MIT community, as long as that person is not a witness or a party to the Complaint.\n9.8.5.5 Pay Status for Time Spent in\xc2\xa0Complaint Resolution Process\nWhere complaint resolution occurs during an employee\xe2\x80\x99s normal working hours, a reasonable amount of paid release time may be granted.\n9.8.5.6 Departure of Complainant or Respondent from MIT\nIf either the Complainant or the Respondent leaves MIT after a Complaint is filed, MIT generally continues the investigation to the extent possible. If an individual sues or files a complaint with an external agency before MIT\xe2\x80\x99s complaint resolution process is completed, MIT also generally continues an ongoing investigation. However, the provisions of this Section 9.8 may be modified by MIT to reflect the fact that one or more parties is no longer at the Institute.\nNotwithstanding the above, MIT may decide to terminate an investigation if one or both of the parties have left MIT, or if a lawsuit or agency complaint has been filed.\n9.8.5.7 Legal Information\nThese procedures serve as the complaint and grievance procedure for employees (including student employees) as required by all relevant state and federal laws, specifically including concerns about race, sex, gender, disability, color, nationality, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, and veteran\'s status (including Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title IX of the Federal Education Amendments of 1972), and all other forms of proscribed discrimination. Questions on this subject may be addressed to the Ombuds Office, the Vice President for Human Resources as the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Opportunity Officer, or the Title IX Coordinator.\nIndividuals may also file complaints of violations of law with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), John F. Kennedy Federal Building, 475 Government Center, Boston, MA 02203, (800) 669-4000; and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"), One Ashburton Place, Rm. 601, Boston, MA 02108, (617) 994-6000. \xc2\xa0For both the EEOC and the MCAD, the time period for filing a complaint is 300 days from the date of the last alleged discriminatory event.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The

See the update history page for more information.\n9.9.1 Introduction\nSexual or romantic relationships may raise concerns of conflict of interest, abuse of authority, favoritism, and unfair treatment when both people are in the MIT work or academic environment, and one person holds a position of power or authority over the other.\xc2\xa0These relationships may also affect others in the work or academic environment, undermining the integrity of their supervision and evaluation as well.\nThese concerns exist even when the relationship is considered consensual by both individuals. In some instances, consent may not be as freely given as the more senior person in the relationship believes. Also, consent may change and relationships may end, with possible adverse effects on the more junior party\xe2\x80\x99s education or career.\nBecause of the possible adverse effects on the other party and on their fellow students, co-workers, colleagues, and others, the Institute prohibits all faculty, other academic instructional staff, other employees, and other non-student members of the MIT community (paid or unpaid) from having sexual or romantic relationships with certain MIT students and employees, whether or not the relationship is consensual. A summary of this policy is as follows, with more detail in the noted sections:\nRelationships with undergraduate students: All faculty, academic instructional staff, other employees, and other non-student members of the MIT community are prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with any undergraduate student in the MIT community. (See Section 9.9.3.1)\nNote: Special rules apply to relationships of students who serve as Graduate Resident Tutors or Advisors (Section 9.9.3.1) or as Teaching Assistants, graders, or laboratory assistants. See Section 9.9.3.3.\nRelationships with graduate students and other learners:\nFaculty and other academic instructional staff are prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with an MIT graduate student or other learner at MIT if they have or might reasonably be expected to have academic authority over that individual (See Section 9.9.3.2).\nOther employees whose job duties include broad influence or authority over graduate students and other learners are prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with such a student or learner if the employee has or might reasonably be expected to have influence or authority over that individual (see Section 9.9.3.2).\nPrincipal Investigators\xe2\x80\x99 relationships with graduate students or postdoctoral scholars: Principal Investigators are prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with a graduate student or postdoctoral scholar if they have direct or indirect authority over that student or scholar. (Section 9.9.4)\nSupervisors and Subordinates: Supervisors (including faculty supervisors and supervisors of postdoctoral scholars) are prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with anyone they supervise, evaluate, or otherwise have direct or indirect influence or authority (see Section 9.9.5).\nParticipating in a sexual or romantic relationship prohibited by this policy, and failure to promptly notify and recuse where required by the policy can lead to disciplinary action including termination of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with MIT. Where this policy imposes a duty to notify and recuse, that duty falls on the person in the position of power or authority in the relationship. Where required, notification and recusal must take place as soon as practical after any action has been taken by either party to establish a sexual or romantic relationship.\n9.9.2 Definitions\nAcademic authority includes teaching, grading, advising, mentoring, evaluating or supervising research; participating in decisions on academic status; managing teaching assignments; participating in decisions on funding or other resources affecting students; writing a letter of reference or otherwise recommending for admission, employment, fellowships or awards. For MITx courses and for professional or executive education classes or programs, a faculty or other academic instructional staff member does not have academic authority if they only supply lectures and materials but otherwise do not participate in teaching or managing the course, nor do they have academic authority with respect to any individual learner or participant who is not seeking credit or a credential.\nEmployees whose jobs confer broad influence or authority over MIT graduate students or other learners include counselors; athletic coaches; staff involved in discipline; staff providing services directly for students; staff with the ability to access or modify a student\xe2\x80\x99s academic, financial or other record; and staff working in deans\xe2\x80\x99 offices or academic headquarters.\nA sexual or romantic relationship is any intimate, sexual, or other type of romantic or amorous relationship, whether casual or serious, short or long term, and whether or not consensual. A single sexual encounter is considered a sexual relationship under this policy. Conversely, the relationship does not have to include physical intimacy if a romantic relationship exists that is beyond the reasonable boundaries of a collegial or professional relationship. If there is any doubt whether a relationship falls under this policy, individuals should seek guidance from their supervisor or an MIT human resources professional.\nFor this policy, undergraduate student means any student at MIT who does not have a college degree, regardless of registration status. The term \xe2\x80\x9cundergraduate student\xe2\x80\x9d includes high school students; MIT undergraduate students during the summer or on a leave of absence; visiting, exchange and special students; and summer school students. Graduate student means any student at MIT who has an undergraduate degree, regardless of registration status, including visiting, exchange and special students, and MIT graduate students on leave. Other learner means anyone studying at MIT other than an undergraduate or graduate student; this term includes online learners on an MIT-sponsored site such as MITx and participants in an MIT professional or executive education program or class.\n9.9.3 Relationships with Students\n9.9.3.1 Relationships with Undergraduate Students\nFaculty, other academic instructional staff, other employees, and other members of the MIT community (other than MIT students) are prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with any undergraduate student at MIT.\nAnyone who serves as a graduate resident tutor or graduate resident advisor is prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with any undergraduate student who lives in that residence/housing.\nIf an employee is in a romantic or sexual relationship with an undergraduate student that pre-dates their employment at MIT or their role as a graduate resident advisor or tutor, or that predates the student\xe2\x80\x99s registration at MIT, the employee must notify their supervisor of the relationship.\n9.9.3.2 Relationships with Graduate Students or Other Learners\nFaculty and individuals with academic instructional appointments\nSexual and romantic relationships are prohibited where the faculty member or other academic instructional staff member has or might reasonably be expected to have \xe2\x80\x9cacademic authority\xe2\x80\x9d (defined above) over that graduate student or other learner. (Such relationships with undergraduates are always prohibited. See Section 9.9.3.1.)\nIn addition, faculty members and other academic instructional staff may not exercise academic authority over any graduate student or other learner with whom they had a prior sexual or romantic relationship. In such a case, the faculty or other academic staff member must promptly notify their department head, dean, or other supervisor and must recuse themselves from any academic authority over that student or other learner.\nIf such a sexual or romantic relationship develops with a graduate student or other learner over whom they have academic authority, the faculty or other academic instructional staff member must withdraw from any academic authority or supervision for that individual. The faculty or academic instructional staff member must notify their department head, dean, or other supervisor so that other arrangements for academic authority and supervision can be made for that student or other learner. See Section 9.9.5.1.\nOther employees working with graduate students and other learners\nAn employee whose job confers \xe2\x80\x9cbroad influence or authority\xe2\x80\x9d (defined above) over students or other learners is prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with a graduate student or other learner if the employee has or might reasonably be expected to have influence or authority over that particular individual. (Such relationships with undergraduates are always prohibited. See Section 9.9.3.1.)\nIn addition, employees may not exercise influence or authority over a graduate student or other learner with whom they had a prior sexual or romantic relationship. In such a case, the employee must promptly notify their supervisor and recuse themselves from any influence or authority regarding that graduate student or other learner.\nIf such a sexual or romantic relationship develops with a graduate student or other learner, the employee must withdraw from exercising any influence or authority over that individual. The employee must also notify their supervisor so that other supervisory or evaluative arrangements can be made for that student or other learner. See Section  9.9.5.1.\n9.9.3.3 Undergraduate and Graduate Students Serving in a Teaching or Advising Capacity\nUndergraduate and graduate students who serve as Teaching Assistants, graders, or laboratory assistants may face conflicts of interest if they have a sexual or romantic relationship with a student in their class or laboratory. Therefore, Teaching Assistants, graders, and laboratory assistants are prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with a student \xe2\x80\x93 undergraduate, graduate or other learner \xe2\x80\x93 over whom the TA/ grader/lab assistant has academic authority.\nIn addition, if a student serving as a TA/grader/lab assistant had a prior sexual or romantic relationship with a student or other learner over whom the TA/grader/lab assistant has academic authority, the TA/grader must notify their supervisor of that prior relationship. The TA/grader/lab assistant must withdraw from any academic authority over that student or other learner.\nIf such a relationship develops, the TA/grader/lab assistant must notify their own supervisor and must withdraw from any academic authority over that student or other learner.\n9.9.4\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Relationships between Principal Investigators and Graduate Students or Postdoctoral Scholars\nPrincipal investigators are prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with any graduate student or postdoctoral scholar (postdoctoral associate or fellow) over whom they have direct or indirect supervisory or other authority.\xc2\xa0 (Such relationships with undergraduates are always prohibited. See Section 9.9.3.1.) \xc2\xa0Examples of \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d supervisory authority or \xe2\x80\x9cother authority\xe2\x80\x9d are the ability to evaluate, to assign or recommend a role in research, to write a letter of recommendation, to determine authorship on papers, and to influence who goes to conferences or who has access to equipment or resources. \xc2\xa0Principal investigators are also subject to the policy on relationships with subordinates who are not students or postdoctoral scholars. See Section 9.9.5.\nIn addition, a principal investigator cannot oversee a graduate student or postdoctoral scholar with whom they had a prior sexual or romantic relationship. That principal investigator must notify their department head, dean, or other supervisor and must withdraw from any supervisory or evaluative functions regarding that individual.\nIf such a relationship develops, the principal investigator must withdraw from any supervisory or evaluative functions for that individual. The principal investigator must notify their own supervisor so that other supervisory or evaluative arrangements can be made. See Section 9.9.5.1.\n9.9.5 \xc2\xa0 Relationships between Faculty or Other Supervisors and Subordinates\nA faculty member, other academic instructional staff member, other employee, or any other member of the MIT community who has supervisory responsibility over a faculty member, employee, postdoc scholar, visitor, or other member of the MIT community is prohibited from having a sexual or romantic relationship with that subordinate.\nIn addition, a supervisor cannot oversee someone with whom they had a prior sexual or romantic relationship. The supervisor must recuse themselves from any supervisory or evaluative functions and must notify their own department head or other supervisor.\nIf such a relationship develops, the supervisor must withdraw from any supervisory or evaluative functions for that subordinate and must notify their own supervisor.\nEven if a direct supervisory role does not exist, one person in a relationship may not evaluate the other\xe2\x80\x99s work or exercise direct or indirect influence or authority over the other person\xe2\x80\x99s work or position, including sitting on or writing a letter of reference to a hiring or promotion and tenure committee considering that other person. In such cases, the senior person in the relationship must recuse themselves and must notify their own supervisor.\nSee also Section 7.2, Employment of Members of the Same Family.\n9.9.5.1 Responsibilities of Supervisors Who Learn of a Prohibited Relationship\nA department head, supervisor or other manager who learns of a current or prior sexual or romantic relationship must take steps to eliminate or manage the potential conflict of interest or abuse of authority. The goal is to put in place adequate alternative supervisory or evaluative arrangements that are fair to the subordinate party and also to their colleagues or peers. The alternative arrangements may include measures like anonymous grading (where practical) or direct evaluation or supervision by someone at or above the level of the senior person in the relationship, or by someone in a different line of authority. Where an alternative supervisor or evaluator is used, that alternative person cannot report to the senior person in the relationship.\nThe alternative arrangements will vary depending on the specifics of the relationship and the context, and supervisors are encouraged to consult with their department head or other superior or with an MIT human resources professional.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0

See the update history page for more information.\nThe following policies address the use of cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs at MIT.\n9.13.1 Campus Smoking Policy\nSmoking is prohibited in all spaces of all MIT buildings, including in all MIT residence halls as stated in the Housing Policies.\xc2\xa0The prohibition against smoking includes the use of electronic cigarettes and other nicotine delivery products or devices.\xc2\xa0 Violators of this policy may be subject to serious sanctions. (For employee sanctions, see\xc2\xa0MIT Employment Policy Manual Section 3.2.3 Corrective Action. For student sanctions, see\xc2\xa0MIT\'s Committee on Discipline \"Rules and Regulations.\")\n9.13.2 Policy on the Use of Alcohol\nMIT observes all laws and regulations governing the sale, purchase, and serving of alcoholic beverages by all members of its community, and expects that these laws will be adhered to at all events associated with the Institute. This includes activities on the MIT campus, in MIT independent living groups, and at off-campus functions sponsored or supported by MIT or any of its affiliated groups.\nThe Institute does not intend through its guidelines or policies to restrict the responsible use of alcohol by members of the MIT community who are at or above the legal drinking age of 21. However, efforts to observe existing laws and regulations in an environment where the majority of the undergraduate student body is not of legal drinking age will impose some constraints on those who are of legal drinking age.\nWhere Alcohol May Be Possessed, Served, or Consumed\nAlcoholic beverages may only be possessed by, served to, or consumed by persons of legal drinking age:\nat events that have been registered with or approved by MIT, as described below;\nin areas of the MIT campus that are licensed to serve alcohol (for example, the Muddy Charles Pub, the Thirsty Ear Pub, the R&D Pub, and the MIT Faculty Club);\nin faculty or staff on-campus residences; and (4) for students of legal drinking age, in individual student dormitory rooms.\nPossessing, serving, or consuming alcohol is prohibited under all other circumstances on the MIT campus.\nStudent-Sponsored Events\nAll student-sponsored events at which alcohol will be served must be authorized by a member of the Academic Council or an appropriate designee. In addition, undergraduate students or organizations must register events where alcohol will be served with the Student Activities Office; the Fraternities, Sororities, and Independent Living Groups Office; or the Residential Life Programs Office, and graduate students or organizations must register events where alcohol will be served with the Graduate Students Office or a designee of the Dean for Graduate Students.\nIn general, student organizations may not use Institute funds, including \"house taxes\" and student activities fees to purchase alcohol, though such funds may be used to hire bonded bartenders and/or party monitors. However, for events hosted by graduate student dormitory governments or by housemasters in graduate student housing, MIT funds may be used to purchase alcohol where no one under the age of 21 will be present, and provided the event has been appropriately registered.\nMIT Academic Departments, Laboratories, Centers, and Administrative Units\nEvents that are sponsored by MIT academic departments, laboratories, centers, and administrative units and are being held on the MIT campus (except at Gray House) where alcohol will be served must be authorized by a member of the Academic Council or an appropriate designee. In addition, such events must be registered with the Information Center. (In certain circumstances, the Director of Conference Services in his/her discretion may waive formal registration.) Events that are sponsored by MIT academic departments, laboratories, centers, and administrative units and that are being held off the MIT campus, must be authorized by a member of the Academic Council or an appropriate designee but need not be registered.\nMIT academic departments, laboratories, centers, and administrative units may not use Institute funds to purchase alcohol for events where persons under the age of 21 may be present unless a waiver has been granted by a member of the Academic Council or an appropriate designee. A waiver may be granted based on a determination that all relevant state and local laws and regulations, as well as MIT policies, are understood and will be observed.\nViolations\nViolations of this policy may be grounds for serious disciplinary action, up to and including termination for employees and expulsion for students.\n9.13.3 Policy Regarding a Drug-Free Workplace\nThe unlawful use, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, or possession of any illegal drug is prohibited in any work area of MIT at any time. For purposes of this policy, marijuana is considered an \xe2\x80\x9cillegal drug\xe2\x80\x9d because it remains illegal under federal law.\xc2\xa0Violations of this policy may be grounds for serious disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.\nThe use of illegal drugs in the workplace can obviously affect the work of the drug user, and it can also affect those who work or study with the drug user. Problems arising from drug abuse can be successfully handled in a majority of cases, provided they are recognized in the early stages and referral is made to the appropriate source. The Institute\'s Personal Assistance Program provides substance abuse assessments. Individuals who are suffering from drug abuse are encouraged to seek assistance from this program. All referrals and treatment records are strictly confidential. In instances where it is necessary, sick leave will be granted for inpatient treatment or rehabilitation on the same basis as it is for other health concerns.\nThe federal government requires that each employee directly engaged in the performance of work under a federal grant or contract must\nbe provided with a copy of a statement describing the employer\'s policy, and\nbe notified that, as a condition of employment on that grant or contract, the employee will abide by the terms of the policy and will notify the employer if he or she is convicted of any criminal drug statute violation in the workplace no later than five days after such a conviction.\nAll individuals subject to the federal requirements should report to their employer any conviction, and the employer, in turn, is required to notify the awarding federal agencies of any convictions. At MIT, notification of the federal agencies will be made by Research Administration Services. Department heads and other supervisors, in consultation with the Human Resources Office, will have the responsibility for any disciplinary action, or for requiring offenders to participate satisfactorily in an approved drug treatment program, or both.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4 The Administration\n1.5

In instances where it is necessary, sick leave will be granted for inpatient treatment or rehabilitation on the same basis as it is for other health concerns.\nThe federal government requires that each employee directly engaged in the performance of work under a federal grant or contract must\nbe provided with a copy of a statement describing the employer\'s policy, and\nbe notified that, as a condition of employment on that grant or contract, the employee will abide by the terms of the policy and will notify the employer if he or she is convicted of any criminal drug statute violation in the workplace no later than five days after such a conviction.\nAll individuals subject to the federal requirements should report to their employer any conviction, and the employer, in turn, is required to notify the awarding federal agencies of any convictions. At MIT, notification of the federal agencies will be made by Research Administration Services. Department heads and other supervisors, in consultation with the Human Resources Office, will have the responsibility for any disciplinary action, or for requiring offenders to participate satisfactorily in an approved drug treatment program, or both.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4 The Administration\n1.5

See the update history page for more information.\nThe following policies address the use of cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs at MIT.\n9.13.1 Campus Smoking Policy\nSmoking is prohibited in all spaces of all MIT buildings, including in all MIT residence halls as stated in the Housing Policies.\xc2\xa0The prohibition against smoking includes the use of electronic cigarettes and other nicotine delivery products or devices.\xc2\xa0 Violators of this policy may be subject to serious sanctions. (For employee sanctions, see\xc2\xa0MIT Employment Policy Manual Section 3.2.3 Corrective Action. For student sanctions, see\xc2\xa0MIT\'s Committee on Discipline \"Rules and Regulations.\")\n9.13.2 Policy on the Use of Alcohol\nMIT observes all laws and regulations governing the sale, purchase, and serving of alcoholic beverages by all members of its community, and expects that these laws will be adhered to at all events associated with the Institute. This includes activities on the MIT campus, in MIT independent living groups, and at off-campus functions sponsored or supported by MIT or any of its affiliated groups.\nThe Institute does not intend through its guidelines or policies to restrict the responsible use of alcohol by members of the MIT community who are at or above the legal drinking age of 21. However, efforts to observe existing laws and regulations in an environment where the majority of the undergraduate student body is not of legal drinking age will impose some constraints on those who are of legal drinking age.\nWhere Alcohol May Be Possessed, Served, or Consumed\nAlcoholic beverages may only be possessed by, served to, or consumed by persons of legal drinking age:\nat events that have been registered with or approved by MIT, as described below;\nin areas of the MIT campus that are licensed to serve alcohol (for example, the Muddy Charles Pub, the Thirsty Ear Pub, the R&D Pub, and the MIT Faculty Club);\nin faculty or staff on-campus residences; and (4) for students of legal drinking age, in individual student dormitory rooms.\nPossessing, serving, or consuming alcohol is prohibited under all other circumstances on the MIT campus.\nStudent-Sponsored Events\nAll student-sponsored events at which alcohol will be served must be authorized by a member of the Academic Council or an appropriate designee. In addition, undergraduate students or organizations must register events where alcohol will be served with the Student Activities Office; the Fraternities, Sororities, and Independent Living Groups Office; or the Residential Life Programs Office, and graduate students or organizations must register events where alcohol will be served with the Graduate Students Office or a designee of the Dean for Graduate Students.\nIn general, student organizations may not use Institute funds, including \"house taxes\" and student activities fees to purchase alcohol, though such funds may be used to hire bonded bartenders and/or party monitors. However, for events hosted by graduate student dormitory governments or by housemasters in graduate student housing, MIT funds may be used to purchase alcohol where no one under the age of 21 will be present, and provided the event has been appropriately registered.\nMIT Academic Departments, Laboratories, Centers, and Administrative Units\nEvents that are sponsored by MIT academic departments, laboratories, centers, and administrative units and are being held on the MIT campus (except at Gray House) where alcohol will be served must be authorized by a member of the Academic Council or an appropriate designee. In addition, such events must be registered with the Information Center. (In certain circumstances, the Director of Conference Services in his/her discretion may waive formal registration.) Events that are sponsored by MIT academic departments, laboratories, centers, and administrative units and that are being held off the MIT campus, must be authorized by a member of the Academic Council or an appropriate designee but need not be registered.\nMIT academic departments, laboratories, centers, and administrative units may not use Institute funds to purchase alcohol for events where persons under the age of 21 may be present unless a waiver has been granted by a member of the Academic Council or an appropriate designee. A waiver may be granted based on a determination that all relevant state and local laws and regulations, as well as MIT policies, are understood and will be observed.\nViolations\nViolations of this policy may be grounds for serious disciplinary action, up to and including termination for employees and expulsion for students.\n9.13.3 Policy Regarding a Drug-Free Workplace\nThe unlawful use, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, or possession of any illegal drug is prohibited in any work area of MIT at any time. For purposes of this policy, marijuana is considered an \xe2\x80\x9cillegal drug\xe2\x80\x9d because it remains illegal under federal law.\xc2\xa0Violations of this policy may be grounds for serious disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.\nThe use of illegal drugs in the workplace can obviously affect the work of the drug user, and it can also affect those who work or study with the drug user. Problems arising from drug abuse can be successfully handled in a majority of cases, provided they are recognized in the early stages and referral is made to the appropriate source. The Institute\'s Personal Assistance Program provides substance abuse assessments. Individuals who are suffering from drug abuse are encouraged to seek assistance from this program. All referrals and treatment records are strictly confidential. In instances where it is necessary, sick leave will be granted for inpatient treatment or rehabilitation on the same basis as it is for other health concerns.\nThe federal government requires that each employee directly engaged in the performance of work under a federal grant or contract must\nbe provided with a copy of a statement describing the employer\'s policy, and\nbe notified that, as a condition of employment on that grant or contract, the employee will abide by the terms of the policy and will notify the employer if he or she is convicted of any criminal drug statute violation in the workplace no later than five days after such a conviction.\nAll individuals subject to the federal requirements should report to their employer any conviction, and the employer, in turn, is required to notify the awarding federal agencies of any convictions. At MIT, notification of the federal agencies will be made by Research Administration Services. Department heads and other supervisors, in consultation with the Human Resources Office, will have the responsibility for any disciplinary action, or for requiring offenders to participate satisfactorily in an approved drug treatment program, or both.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4 The Administration\n1.5

See the update history page for more information.\nInstitute facilities \xe2\x80\x94 such as classrooms, lecture halls, memorial rooms, athletic facilities, and Kresge Auditorium, MIT Chapel, Stratton Student Center, and Walker Memorial \xe2\x80\x94 have the primary purpose of supporting the educational program. However, these facilities may also be available for meetings, cultural presentations, entertainment programs, and topical programs that serve to maintain a stimulating intellectual environment. In general, requests for MIT community use will be granted subject to a) the specific priorities and policies established for the requested facility, b) the prior commitments of that facility for regular program use, c) the suitability of the requested space for the particular type of program proposed, and d) the Institute's status as a tax-exempt educational institution. (See Section 12.5.3 for more information on the use of conference rooms, and Section 12.7 Political Action for specific restrictions governing the use of facilities for political purposes.)\nFacilities are not available to individuals but only to academic departments, administrative offices, and officially recognized student, faculty, staff, and employee organizations. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-MIT organizations may be sponsored and overseen by any of the above or by faculty or staff members, with prior permission of the appropriate Institute official. (See Section 12.5.1 Use of Facilities by Non-MIT Groups below.)\nOfficial recognition of all student groups (both graduate and undergraduate) is granted by the Association of Student Activities; faculty groups, by the Provost; and staff and employee groups, by the Vice President for Human Resources.\nThe organization that is assigned a facility for a particular use and time may not change this use or time without obtaining authorization in writing from the official who made the original assignment. The organization may not in any way transfer the use of the facility to another organization.\nThe nature and extent of all advertising for a properly scheduled meeting should be reviewed with the appropriate scheduling officer at the time a room assignment is requested. For student groups, advertising policy is coordinated by the Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagement Office and the Association of Student Activities. In all cases, the name of the organization sponsoring the event must appear on advertising, leaflets, posters, and the like. Admission tickets for events on campus may not be offered for sale at commercial booking offices.\nIn conducting its event, each organization must comply with city, state, and federal laws as well as applicable MIT rules and regulations. In addition, each organization will accept responsibility for conducting its event in accordance with standards of orderly conduct generally acceptable to the MIT community. Requests are granted by the appropriate scheduling offices. (See Section 12.5.2 Scheduling Facilities below.)\nRegistering Events: All campus organizations conducting an event at which alcohol will be served, money will be exchanged, or attendance will exceed 100 must register the event with the appropriate Institute office. Events sponsored by student organizations or events at which the attendance is expected to be primarily students should be registered with the Division of Student Life. Events sponsored by non-student organizations should be registered with the Conference Services, Events, and Information Center.\nPublic Audience: Concerts of the various student performing arts organizations, athletic events, and numerous student-sponsored and department-sponsored lectures and seminars produced primarily for the MIT community are often open to the public. However, a sponsoring campus organization must have its request reviewed and approved in advance by either the Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagement Office and the Association of Student Activities,\xc2\xa0or the Office of the Provost, if a substantial portion of its audience (normally more than 20 percent) is expected to be from outside the MIT community.\nAccessibility: The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires that when planning conferences, events, and activities, the sponsoring office or department handle requests for accommodations. In registration brochures, invitations, or flyers, the following statement should be used: To request disability accommodation, please contact [name, department, address, telephone].\nRegional Meetings of Student Organizations: Campus organizations with counterparts at other colleges may occasionally wish to use Institute facilities for inter-university group meetings. Such requests are reviewed by the Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagement Office and the Campus Activities Complex.\nUse Charges: A use charge covers the portion of the normal operating expenses of a facility during a group's scheduled period of use of that facility. Use charges will not be assessed against officially recognized campus groups, because the normal operating cost of each Institute facility has been budgeted on the basis that it will be used in support, first, of its primary program function and, second, of the programs of other officially recognized campus organizations. Exceptions may be made for MIT programs and events designed specifically for audiences outside of the MIT community. (See Section 12.7 Political Action for guidelines on use charges for political activities on campus.) The final judgment on the fee for use of MIT rooms rests with the Provost.\nDirect Expense Charges: Expenses that are over and above the normal operating expenses of a facility (such as physical plant, dining, audiovisual services, or special security detail) of a facility and are directly attributable to a specific group will be billed to all users, including Institute offices and organizations.\n12.5.1 Use of Facilities by Non-MIT Groups\nThe Institute opens its facilities to use by non-MIT groups when it is feasible and appropriate in light of the needs and objectives of the MIT community. Individuals who wish to sponsor a professional meeting or conference should, after receiving the endorsement of their department heads, inform the Conference Services, Events, and Information Center. Center staff will review the purpose and basic needs of the conference and seek approval from the Facilities Use Committee, which reports to the Provost.\nRequests for facilities for functions cosponsored by an MIT organization and a non-MIT organization are reviewed in the same manner as requests from outside groups. Requests for use of MIT facilities by civic, government, or charitable organizations should be coordinated with the Government and Community Relations Office.\nDetermination of the feasibility and appropriateness of a particular proposal includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of the following:\nthe extent to which the proposed program is related to any concurrently functioning activity or program on the MIT campus;\nthe extent to which persons affiliated with the MIT community will participate in or attend the proposed program;\nevidence of responsibility on the part of the group sponsoring the proposed program or of persons who are members of such a group or who will be participating in the program;\nthe direct and indirect costs to MIT of the program; and\nthe suitability of the available space for the particular type of program proposed.\nTypical events held by non-MIT groups include functions of Cambridge and Boston civic, governmental, and charitable organizations and national and international conferences of educational, professional, and student organizations.\nInstitute meeting facilities are not available for commercial or industrial meetings, or private training programs. This does not, however, necessarily exclude civic action meetings or programs that might be sponsored by a commercial concern or industrial association.\nEach outside group must have as sponsor a recognized MIT organization or a member of the Faculty or staff. The sponsor will be responsible for maintaining a continuing liaison between the outside group and the appropriate Institute officials throughout the planning and implementation stages of the event. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to assure that the organization, its members, and the program adhere to the generally accepted academic and communal standards of the Institute. The sponsor is financially liable for the program in the event the outside organization is delinquent in this regard.\nCoordination of Conferences or Special Events: Once approval for an event is given by the Facilities Use Committee, the Conference Services, Events, and Information Center staff will work with the MIT sponsor to determine the detailed logistical needs and plans for the conference, and will coordinate all of the MIT services connected with the event.\nAccessibility: The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires that when planning conferences, events, and activities, the sponsoring office or department handle requests for accommodations. In registration brochures, invitations, or flyers, the following statement should be used: To request disability accommodation, please contact [name, department, address, telephone].\nUse Charges: Groups outside the MIT community will be charged for the operating expenses attributable to their use of MIT facilities and services (such as physical plant, dining, graphic arts, audiovisual services, or a special security detail) in addition to a use charge for the room or facility. The final judgment on the fee for use of MIT rooms rests with the Provost.\n12.5.2 Scheduling Facilities\nThe offices responsible for scheduling facilities are listed below; a Facilities Use Committee member assists these offices in making decisions about the use of space.\nClassrooms (including lecture halls): Schedules Section of the Registrar's Office; certain lecture halls and seminar rooms have departmental priority.\nConference rooms: Individual academic departments. (See Section 12.5.3 below for more information on scheduling conference rooms.)\nKresge Auditorium, MIT Chapel, Stratton Student Center, Walker Memorial, Religious Activities Center, Tang Center: Office of the Campus Activities Complex.\nAthletic facilities: Department of Athletics.\nInstitute house lounges: During the academic year, the Dean for Student Life delegates responsibility to individual house student governments.\n12.5.3 Conference Room Policy\nAll meeting, seminar, and conference rooms should be accessible by all departments for the purpose of conducting Institute business, with the following stipulations:\nPriority, in the following order, must be given to the following:\nThe department to which the space is assigned.\nMeetings of the Corporation (including the Corporation visiting committees, Executive Committee, and other standing committees of the Corporation).\nStanding faculty committees.\nIn general, rooms cannot be reserved more than 12 weeks in advance, except for the following:\nCommittees with yearly meeting schedules (such as faculty committees).\nCorporation visiting committees.\nSpecial events (such as celebrations and conferences) that involve outside participants.\nUsers have logistical and financial responsibility for returning rooms to their original state. Users who fail to comply may lose the privilege of using shared meeting facilities.\nOnce a room has been reserved, the reservation cannot be preempted except for extraordinary situations (such as a press conference for a Nobel Prize announcement).\n12.5.4 MIT Use of Outside Facilities\nOfficial Institute business is occasionally conducted in private clubs outside the Institute. Some private clubs have discriminatory membership policies or practices. Consistency with the Institute's long-established policy of nondiscrimination requires that no member of the MIT community be placed in the position of having to participate in an official MIT function at a place where he or she would not be welcome as a member. In keeping with this policy, it is inappropriate for official MIT business or social functions to be conducted at Institute expense in clubs having discriminatory membership policies.\nAlso, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires that when planning conferences, events, and activities, the sponsoring office or department handle requests for accommodations. In registration brochures, invitations, or flyers, the following statement should be used: To request disability accommodation, please contact [name, department, address, telephone].\nMenu\nManuals

See the update history page for more information.\nMIT is committed to generating, disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world\xe2\x80\x99s great challenges. We believe this commitment helps meet MIT\xe2\x80\x99s goal of global impact. This policy enables MIT intellectual property to be made widely available through a variety of means\xe2\x80\x94including traditional commercial licensing and granting open access permissions\xe2\x80\x94and sharing licensing proceeds with the inventors, authors, or contributors who generate such intellectual property.\nIn general, the federal Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 requires that universities receiving federal funding for research own patentable inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of such research. In addition, certain federal regulations require that the government receive rights to software and data created pursuant to federally funded research.\nIn addition to the federal government, other research sponsors (e.g., companies, foundations) typically require MIT to (a) report patentable inventions and copyrightable works that result from the use of such sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s funds; (b) secure legal protection for such intellectual property or, alternatively, commit to open access principles of dissemination; and (c) make such intellectual property available for licensing, or ensure its availability through open access channels, all of which MIT is best positioned to do when MIT owns the intellectual property.\nFinally, MIT owns the intellectual property that results from MIT resources and opportunities.\nDecisions about the protection and dissemination of MIT Intellectual Property is handled by the MIT Technology Licensing Office (TLO), an office within the Office of Strategic Alliances and Technology Transfer (OSATT), with appropriate consultation with counsel, inventors, authors, or contributors.\nMIT\xe2\x80\x99s President appoints membership to the Committee on Intellectual Property (CoIP). The CoIP recommends Intellectual Property policies (the \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy\xe2\x80\x9d). The Vice President for Research chairs the CoIP and is responsible for the implementation and administration of this Policy.\n13.1.1 Definitions\nExempt Programs means those programs identified by the Office of the Vice President for Research.\nIntellectual Property (\xe2\x80\x9cIP\xe2\x80\x9d) means patentable inventions, copyrightable works (including software and mask works), Materials, trademarks and Supporting Information.\nIPIA means an MIT Inventions and Proprietary Information Agreement.\nMaterials means items and information created, collected, developed, derived, or obtained in the course of MIT research (for example, audio-recordings; certain datasets; specifications; biological specimens; microchips; circuits; devices; and chemical samples).\nMIT Funds means discretionary funds, gifts (including in-kind donations from third parties, such as equipment), grants, consortium or sponsored funding (including a sub-award) that are (a) given or granted to MIT; (b) pursuant to a contract; (c) administered by MIT; or (d) granted by MIT for use by researchers in the conduct of research. For clarity, funding that is provided to MIT (whether via a gift contract with MIT or otherwise), even if specifically designated for a particular researcher at MIT, constitutes MIT Funds.\nRequired IPIA Signatories means employees (including temporary employees), faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral associates, fellows, visitors, research affiliates, staff affiliates (where appropriate), contingent workers, and contractors at Lincoln Lab and\xe2\x80\x94in certain circumstances only\xe2\x80\x94undergraduates. See Guiding Principles Regarding Student IP Rights.\nSupporting Information means any and all records, memoranda, notes, schedules, plans, or other documentation and information that describe or support IP.\n13.1.2 Intellectual Property Owned by MIT\nMIT owns IP generated by one or more of the following:\nUsing MIT Funds;\nIn the performance of a Required IPIA Signatory\xe2\x80\x99s MIT employment;\nIn the performance of an MIT collaboration, research or other sponsored agreement;\nFor Required IPIA Signatories who are not employees, faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral associates or fellows, as a result of research or educational opportunities made available by or at MIT (collectively, an \xe2\x80\x9cMIT Opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d).\n13.1.3 Intellectual Property Not Owned by MIT\nMIT does not own the following IP, unless otherwise stated below:\nCoursework generated by MIT students (except coursework generated by students taking part in certain capstone courses such as Beaver Works or UROPs for credit).\nCopyright in student theses.\nHowever, as stated in the Rules & Regulations of the Faculty, Section 2.73, students must grant MIT a license to their thesis as a condition of receiving their degree.\nNote that patentable inventions, software, and Materials described in the student thesis are, subject to a separate exception set forth in this Section 13.1.3, owned by MIT.\nIP generated from participation in MIT sponsored hackathons.\nIP generated from the use of MIT maker spaces.\nHowever, MIT owns IP generated from (a) using MIT maker spaces to build upon or improve existing MIT-owned IP or (b) using MIT maker spaces for projects that are not separate and distinct from the scope of research being performed using MIT Funds or through another MIT Opportunity.\nIP generated from participation in Exempt Programs if participants receive advance approval from the Executive Director of the TLO.\nCopyright in creative literary works such as textbooks, manuscripts, books, scholarly works, and publications, unless MIT has specifically commissioned a particular work to be written.\nNote that patentable inventions, software, and Materials described in the creative literary work are, unless subject to a separate exception set forth in this Section 13.1.3, owned by MIT.\nOn a case-by-case basis, particularly when works are the result of collaborative projects, MIT may request a right from the authors to use such works for research, teaching, and educational purposes.\nNon-literary creative works (for example, artwork, musical scores), unless MIT has specifically commissioned a particular work to be created.\nOwnership of images taken of MIT-owned items (for example, equipment, research outcomes) may be determined on a case-by-case basis.\nOn a case-by-case basis, particularly when works are the result of collaborative projects, MIT may request a right from the authors to use such works for research, teaching, and educational purposes.\nTeaching materials (for example, lecture notes, syllabi, non-third-party images created for a class, presentations).\nOpen Learning, Executive Education, and MIT Professional Education content, except that MIT owns the recording of such content.\nNote that ownership of this content may be otherwise agreed-to in writing between MIT and the author.\nThis list may not cover every circumstance. Any questions concerning ownership of IP should be directed to the TLO at tlo@mit.edu.\n13.1.4 IPIA and Assignment\nRequired IPIA Signatories must sign the IPIA. The IPIA is managed by the TLO and may be changed at the TLO\xe2\x80\x99s discretion. Notwithstanding the obligation for Required IPIA Signatories to sign the IPIA, Required IPIA Signatories acknowledge that they are bound by this Policy by using MIT Funds, accepting or continuing MIT employment, participating in performing an MIT collaboration, research, or other sponsored agreement, or by taking advantage of an MIT Opportunity, and each Required IPIA Signatory acknowledges that they hereby irrevocably assign all right, title, and interest in and to the IP described in Section 13.1.2 above (including but not limited to patent applications and patents which may issue from such IP), effective as of their first date of the use of MIT Funds, MIT employment, participating in performing an MIT collaboration, research or other sponsored agreement, or taking advantage of any MIT Opportunity, whichever occurs first, regardless of whether they execute or executed an IPIA.\n13.1.5 Technology Disclosure Obligations\nInventors, authors, and contributors are required to promptly disclose all IP owned, either in whole or in part by MIT, to the TLO. Details on submitting disclosures can be found at Submit Your Disclosure.\n13.1.6 Licensing of Intellectual Property and Revenue Sharing\nThe TLO is responsible for managing and licensing MIT-owned IP. See the TLO website.\nWhen revenue is received in exchange for licensing MIT-owned IP, the TLO distributes that revenue after all TLO operational and patent expenses are reimbursed, among (a) inventors, authors, and contributors of such IP (as applicable); (b) joint owners of the IP (as applicable); (c) relevant MIT departments, labs, and centers; and (d) the MIT General Fund to be used for educational and research purposes in an apportionment further described\xc2\xa0here. The apportionment may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Provost upon recommendation by TLO.\n13.1.7 Return of MIT-Owned Intellectual Property to an Inventor or Author\nInventors and authors of MIT-owned IP may request that MIT assign its ownership interest in such IP back to such inventors or authors (\xe2\x80\x9cReturned IP\xe2\x80\x9d). Any such request should be made to the TLO. MIT may grant the request if such assignment (a) is legally permissible; (b) is consistent with MIT\xe2\x80\x99s obligations to third parties; (c) does not present a conflict of interest; and (d) would enhance the possibility of the IP benefitting the public.\nIn every case of Returned IP, (i) MIT reserves for itself and all other non-profit research institutions a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable right to practice the Returned IP for research, teaching, and educational purposes and (ii) if the Returned IP was generated with federal funding, the assignment will be subject to the applicable government rights to use such Returned IP and compliance with all other applicable laws and regulations.\nAny costs related to the protection of any such Returned IP (for example, the cost of patent maintenance or prosecution) shall be the responsibility of the inventors or authors, unless otherwise agreed with the TLO.\nIf the Returned IP is a patentable invention and was generated with federal funding, the inventors shall comply with all laws regarding the patentable invention and any additional requirements imposed by the federal government. Information about the process for inventors to request that MIT support a request to the federal government to effectuate assignment to the inventors can be found here. \xc2\xa0If the Returned IP was funded by another organization, the inventors shall comply with applicable terms and conditions, if any.\n13.1.8 Intellectual Property and Conflict of Interest Policies\nTo the extent Required IPIA Signatories have consulting privileges (see Section 4.5 Outside Professional Activities, and this website Outside Professional Activities) or engage in any outside professional activities (including externships and internships), the Required IPIA Signatory must ensure that any terms of their consulting or other agreements with third parties that relate to IP do not conflict with a Required IPIA Signatory\xe2\x80\x99s commitments to MIT under this Policy. Each Required IPIA Signatory should make the nature of their IP obligations to MIT clear to any third party with which they are engaged. See Section 4.4 Conflict of Interest. Questions concerning the Required IPIA Signatory\xe2\x80\x99s IP obligations to MIT may be directed to the TLO at tlo-ipia@mit.edu. MIT will not negotiate any consulting agreements on behalf of any Required IPIA Signatory.\nThe scope of the consulting services must be separate and distinct from the scope of the Required IPIA Signatory\xe2\x80\x99s MIT research commitments.\nRequired IPIA Signatories should not advise third parties with which they have consulting arrangements on strategy concerning patentable inventions where such strategy is potentially adverse to MIT.\nEmployees who assist on matters involving private entities interested in sponsoring research at MIT or optioning or licensing MIT-owned IP may not have any financial or personal interest in such private entity.\n13.1.9 Policy Interpretation and Administration\nMatters arising from the interpretation or administration of this Policy will be resolved by the IP Policy Committee (the \xe2\x80\x9cIPPC\xe2\x80\x9d), a sub-committee of the CoIP, which may seek advice from the Office of the General Counsel. The IPPC will also make recommendations to the CoIP concerning the application of this Policy. Specifically, disputes concerning accurate inventor, author, and contributor identification of MIT-owned IP that remain unresolved by the TLO will be escalated to the IPPC, for resolution in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4 The Administration\n1.5 The

See the update history page for more information.\nInformation technology policies ensure that everyone's use of the Institute's information technology resources supports its educational, research, public service, and administrative mission in the best possible way. Effective support of the Institute's mission requires complying with relevant legal, contractual, professional, and policy obligations whenever information technology resources are used. Effective support also means that individuals not interfere with the appropriate uses of information technology resources by others.\nThis policy broadly covers all of the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s information technology resources \xe2\x80\x93 hardware, software, and content; this includes but is not limited to electronic networks, systems, computers, devices, telephones, software, data, files, and all content residing in any of these (referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cIT resources\xe2\x80\x9d). This policy applies to all records of the Institute and to the information in those records, regardless of the form or the location.\n13.2.1 Privacy and Confidentiality of Institute Records\nAll members of the MIT community are responsible for ensuring that their handling of information about individuals is consistent with the Institute's policy on privacy of personal information (see Section 11.2 Use of Personal Information). \xc2\xa0In addition, other Institute records (that is, records that do not contain personal information) must be handled with due regard for privacy and confidentiality concerns. (See Section 13.2.2.2 Security of Information and 13.2.4 Privacy of Electronic Communications, Electronic Files, and Other Files).\n13.2.2 Information Preservation and Security\n13.2.2.1 Preservation of Information\nMIT has an obligation to provide accurate, reliable information to authorized recipients and to preserve vital records (see Section 13.3 Archival Policy). MIT is increasingly dependent on the accuracy, availability, and accessibility of information stored electronically and on the computing and networking resources that store, process, and transmit this information. Records created and maintained in electronic form are included in the Institute's definition of archival materials. In addition, upon direction from the Office of the General Counsel, records must sometimes be preserved for prescribed periods of time for litigation or other legal purposes.\n13.2.2.2 Security of Information\nIndividuals who manage or use IT resources required by the Institute to carry out its mission must take reasonable steps to protect them from unauthorized modification, disclosure, and destruction. \xc2\xa0Data and software are to be protected, regardless of the form, medium, or storage location of the information. The level of protection shall be commensurate with the risk of exposure and with the value of the information and of the IT resources.\nSome information has additional legal protection, like certain medical information, education records (see Section 11.3 Privacy of Student Records), certain financial records, and specific categories of personal information covered in MIT\xe2\x80\x99s Written Information Security Program. \xc2\xa0As described in the Written Information Security Program, departments that regularly use specified categories of personal information should have written procedures on protecting that data, and should also implement specific procedures concerning how that data is destroyed when no longer needed.\n13.2.3 Responsible Use of IT Resources\n13.2.3.1 Approved Use of IT Resources\nAll members of the MIT community are obligated to use MIT\xe2\x80\x99s IT resources in accordance with applicable laws, with Institute policies (including its policy against harassment, and its standards of honesty and personal conduct), and in ways that are responsible, ethical, and professional. Users of MIT\xe2\x80\x99s network must also comply with the MITnet Rules of Use.\nThe use of MIT's IT resources is restricted to Institute business and incidental personal use. Incidental personal use may not interfere with MIT work, nor may it result in additional direct cost to MIT.\xc2\xa0 MIT's computers and other IT resources must be used in a manner consistent with MIT\xe2\x80\x99s status as a non-profit organization, and so, for example, cannot be used for the benefit of personal businesses or other organizations unless permitted by MIT policy (for example, permitted under Section 4.5 Outside Professional Activities) or otherwise authorized. \xc2\xa0Unauthorized access to and use of MIT\xe2\x80\x99s IT resources violates this policy.\n13.2.3.2 Interference with IT Resources\nMembers of the Institute community should not take unauthorized actions to interfere with, disrupt, or alter the integrity of MIT\xe2\x80\x99s IT resources. \xc2\xa0Efforts to restrict or deny access by legitimate users of the Institute's IT resources are unacceptable. Individuals should not use MIT facilities to interfere with or alter the integrity of any IT resources, irrespective of their location.\nDestruction, alteration, or disclosure without authorization of data, programs, or other content\xc2\xa0 that belongs to others but that is accessed through MIT\xe2\x80\x99s IT resources is also prohibited. MIT may block an individual or group\xe2\x80\x99s access to its IT resources in order to protect its IT resources and the information contained in them.\n13.2.4 Privacy of Electronic Communications, Electronic Files, and Other Files\nAs noted in Section 13.2.2.2 Security of Information, members of the MIT community should exercise caution to protect information (and particularly personal information) from unauthorized disclosure.\xc2\xa0 Particular caution should be used with electronic communications, because of the ease with which such communications can be distributed and due to concerns about unauthorized access. \xc2\xa0Unauthorized interception of email and other electronic communications is prohibited by MIT policy and may also violate state and federal law.\nFor legitimate business reasons, representatives of the Institute may need to access electronic or other records (including paper files) without the consent of the individuals having custody of them; examples of these business reasons include access required by law, where the individual is unavailable due to illness, in the course of an investigation, or in cases of alleged misconduct.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Departments, labs, or centers may determine additional reasons for access, for example, due to sponsor requirements (as at Lincoln Laboratory). \xc2\xa0Any member of the MIT community who accesses information from records maintained by another individual without the individual's consent must seek prior approval from the applicable Senior Officer or his or her designee for such access and related disclosure; the Senior Officer or designee may consult the Office of the General Counsel. This process applies to requests for access from an outside entity or from another office within MIT.\n13.2.5 Third-Party Products and Services\n13.2.5.1 Restrictions on Use of Certain IT Resources from Outside Sources\nSpecial restrictions are often placed on the use of IT resources \xe2\x80\x94 such as hardware, software, databases, and documentation \xe2\x80\x94 acquired from outside sources. Use of such IT resources may be further restricted by patent law, as a trade secret, or by contract in the form of a license or other agreement. Members of the MIT community are required to abide by the restrictions imposed by law or by contract on IT Resources acquired for use at the Institute. Any individual who arranges for authorized distribution of information technology products and services from outside sources must advise the people having access to the products and services of all the associated usage restrictions.\n13.2.5.2 Copyright\nUnless it has been placed in the public domain, most third-party software is protected by copyright law and may be subject to restrictions on use, copying, and distribution.\xc2\xa0 More information on copyright can be found at Section 13.5 Reproduction of Copyrighted Materials.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and

See the update history page for more information.\nRecognizing the need to ensure the preservation and availability of the official records of the Institute for legal, administrative, and historical purposes, the MIT Corporation has adopted the following archival policy.\nAll records generated or received by the various administrative and academic offices of the Institute in the conduct of their business, regardless of the form in which they are created and maintained, are the property of the Institute and constitute archival material. The records covered by this policy include official printed material, correspondence, machine-readable files, record books, minutes, committee files, financial records, and associated papers.\nAll administrative officers of the Institute and Officers of the Corporation, as well as those members of the Faculty who, by virtue of administrative responsibilities either of a continuing or occasional nature, possess files, records, or documents relating to their official duties, are requested to observe the following regulations:\nArchival material in MIT offices may not be destroyed or placed in storage without the approval of a committee of three consisting of the following:\nthe President's designee, representing the Corporation and the administration;\nthe Institute Archivist, representing the Director of the MIT Libraries; and\nthe dean of the appropriate School in the case of academic departments, the Provost in the case of interdepartmental laboratories or other interdepartmental entities, or the cognizant senior officer in the case of administrative or other general Institute and alumni offices.\nMaterial so selected for preservation shall be sent to the MIT Archives in the Libraries.\nThe officer in charge of each administrative or academic office, in consultation with the Institute Archivist, will be responsible for deciding how long inactive papers are to be retained in and under the direct control of the office concerned.\nAll photographs, other visual material, and artifacts significant to the Institute's history shall be sent to the MIT Museum.\nThe Institute would also welcome the offer of privately owned material bearing on the history of the Institute and of science and technology, provided, however, that the Institute incurs no obligation to retain such material as an integrated collection or in any prescribed form.\nThe implementation of this policy is the responsibility of the Institute Archives and Records Management Program of the MIT Libraries.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4 The Administration\n1.5 The Faculty\n1.6 Institute Councils and

See the update history page for more information.\nThe primary purpose of Institute research is to advance knowledge and further the educational program. Instruction and research are interdependent and both suffer when dealt with separately. These functions have, therefore, been integrated and interwoven throughout the entire academic and administrative structure.\nThe Institute also has an inherent obligation to render public service, especially to any branch of local, state, or federal government, and in fulfilling this special responsibility undertakes research when it can do so without impairing its primary functions and when its available personnel and facilities and its experience qualify it to perform a needed service.\nInstitute research programs receive substantial support through contracts, grants, and other arrangements with government, industry, and foundations. From the Institute's experience with such support, general conclusions have evolved as to the conditions under which it can be justified and the manner in which it can most effectively be integrated with other activities of the Institute. These conclusions are set forth in the following sections.\nIn addition, governmental and private sponsors provide support for the construction and renovation of facilities, fellowships and traineeships, curriculum improvement, teacher training, and other programs designed to strengthen graduate and undergraduate education. The suitability of these programs in relation to Institute activities and objectives has in most cases been evaluated using the same review procedures as are employed in the review of research proposals. Where the support is provided under agreements that create Institute obligations and contractual commitments to the sponsor, the delegation of administrative responsibility is the same as for sponsored research. To this extent the material that follows is also applicable to sponsored programs other than research.\n14.1.1 General Research Considerations\nThe following are general considerations for research at the Institute:\nThe Institute should not compete with industry in industrial research or undertake activities that should more properly be the responsibility of government agencies. Two factors may justify a secondary activity in such areas: the importance of practical creative activity on case material in any effective professional education and the responsibility of an educational institution to render public service.\nMIT is a private institution, under a broad charter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, performing particular functions as determined by the Corporation. The Corporation and the administration must retain proper control of the operations carried on in the name of the Institute and remain free to operate without restrictions that would reduce its effectiveness.\nThe Institute has an advantageous environment for research, due to such factors as independence and relative simplicity in management, employment, subcontracting, and methods of accounting, and possession of key staff and facilities. MIT cannot accept in research agreements any restrictive clauses that would jeopardize the very environment the Institute considers essential to the effective conduct of research, except in those rare instances where restrictions are accepted as provided for in\xc2\xa0Section 14.2 Open Research and Free Interchange of Information.\nIn research, the sponsor and MIT have a joint and continuing obligation to provide not only the contractual and administrative environment but also the financial basis for a sound program of investigation. In general, MIT's resources are such that it cannot provide this environment except on a full cost-reimbursement basis, including direct and indirect costs.\nNo person is permitted to use Institute facilities for sponsored research unless arrangements have been made through proper administrative channels as outlined in\xc2\xa0Section 14.4 Office of Sponsored Programs.\n14.1.2 Criteria for Evaluating Research Proposals\nIn addition to the general research considerations outlined in\xc2\xa0Section 14.1.1, the criteria to be used in evaluating the acceptability of a proposed research program include the following:\nA departmental or interdepartmental laboratory of the Institute must be willing to accept responsibility for the program and must have faculty or staff members who are available and willing to supervise the program. The technical supervision of all research projects is the responsibility of the individuals directing them, who in turn are responsible to their department heads (unless this responsibility has been explicitly vested elsewhere).\nIt must be possible to conduct the project without overloading the academic staff and without detriment to the educational program.\nThe project must not encroach on space and facilities required by the educational program. Availability of space and equipment must be assured in advance by the department head and dean concerned, or by the Provost if any renovation or building changes are contemplated or if space outside the jurisdiction of the department head will be involved.\nThe project must come within the volume of research (measured in dollars, space, personnel, and required amount of administrative attention) that the Institute can appropriately undertake. It must also fit into a balanced, overall program.\n14.1.3 Disposition or Transfer of Equipment\nIn order to comply with its charter and meet its educational objectives, MIT must hold in public trust any property in which it has acquired ownership and must relinquish such property only when it would more effectively serve the scientific or educational objectives for which it was acquired or when it is necessary to fulfill MIT obligations to donors or research sponsors.\nEquipment subject to the control of or restrictions imposed by a donor or research sponsor will be disposed of in accordance with those restrictions. Equipment in which MIT has title without restriction or limitation may be relinquished by MIT only under limited circumstances. Consequently, project supervisors who wish to initiate a request for disposition or transfer of equipment purchased under a sponsored program should consult the Property Office Disposal Officer in advance of the desired transfer date.\n14.1.4 Financial and Business Administration\nThe Office of Sponsored Programs is responsible for financial and business policies and procedures for sponsored research, including those designed to meet the requirements of grants and contracts. The Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs is the contracting officer of the Institute and is directly responsible for the negotiation and interpretation of sponsored research contracts and grants, including basic agreements, and for negotiating the reimbursement of indirect costs and employee benefits, but this may be delegated in part to other officers of the Institute.\nWhile retaining Institute-wide responsibility for business and financial activities related to sponsored research, the Executive Vice President may delegate specific operational responsibility and authority to the Director of Lincoln Laboratory.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3 The Corporation\n1.4 The Administration\n1.5 The Faculty\n1.6

See the update history page for more information.\nThe art and object collections of MIT uphold standards of excellence and enduring quality for the benefit of students, faculty and staff and the larger community. To maintain these standards, the Institute applies policies and procedures for the acceptance and commissioning of tangible artistic property. It also cites additional policies specific to the List Visual Arts Center (LVAC) and the MIT Museum.\nThe MIT Corporation is responsible for the acceptance of all gifts.\nHowever, in order to insure the quality and coherence of the permanent public collection, which is defined as art objects sited in public locations other than museum exhibit spaces, and one percent for the Arts commissions incorporated into the architecture, the following procedure will be followed:\nIn the case of art objects designated for public siting, The LVAC Collections Committee will evaluate the object or commission and make a recommendation to the Director of the LVAC and the Associate Provost.\nA chair or co-chair of the Collections Committee will be appointed by the Chair of the Advisory Committee in consultation with the List Center Director and the Associate Provost. Members of the Collection Committee need not be members of the Advisory Committee. The committee may choose to refer some Collections matters to the full Advisory Committee. In all cases, it will ultimately report its actions to the full Advisory Committee.\nBased on discussions with and the recommendation of the Collections Committee, the chair will make a recommendation to the Director of the LVAC and the Associate Provost.\nThe Associate Provost will make a recommendation to the President, who will also consult with the Institute Building Committee.\nIn the case of one percent for the Arts, consultation among the Director of the List Visual Arts Center, the architects, and the project clients will precede the procedures described in b)i-iii).\nIn all other cases, any decision to accept materials donated to the List Visual Arts Center or the MIT Museum is solely within the purview of the relevant organization as described by its published collections policies and accession procedures.\nAll of the procedures above will also apply to any long-term loans that are offered to the Institute and all art and artifacts that may be produced at the Institute, including those of artists in residence, members of the Faculty, and alumni/ae artists.\nAlthough it is stated in the published collections policies of both the LVAC and the MIT Museum, it should be noted here that gifts to the permanent collection are never accepted with restrictions attached to them.\nThose artifacts that do not fit into either the MIT Museum's or the LVAC's collections but that the Institute wishes to accept (such as gifts of furniture or other pieces of decorative art) or those artifacts acquired by specific departments with special interest collections should be considered the property and management responsibility of the department that acquires them. Neither the MIT Museum nor the LVAC will be responsible for maintenance, storage, conservation, insurance, or inventory control of these artifacts.\nWorks that are not appropriate to the collections of either the LVAC or the MIT Museum but that the Institute wishes to accept in order to sell later will fall under the present arrangement with the Treasurer's Office and will not at any time be considered a part of the permanent collection. Neither the LVAC nor the MIT Museum will be responsible for the maintenance, storage, insurance, or conservation of such non-accessioned gifts in kind. Insurance claims under these arrangements are processed through the Office of Insurance and Legal Affairs.\nMenu\nManuals sections\n1.0 The Institute\n1.1 Mission and Objectives\n1.2 Description\n1.3
