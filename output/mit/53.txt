Policies & Procedures | For Allegations Against Faculty | FAQ
FAQ for Allegations Against FacultyThese FAQs do not cover allegations of Title IX Sexual Harassment (see P&P, Section 9.5). The FAQs are in the process of being updated. If you have questions about Title IX Sexual Harassment, please see the Information for Formal Complaints Against Staff and Faculty –Title IX Sexual Harassment page or email IDHR at idhr@mit.edu
Application of Policy
What is a Complaint under Section 9.8?
A Complaint under Policies & Procedures Section 9.8 is a formal complaint alleging a violation of an MIT Conduct Policy, including those alleging discrimination or discriminatory harassment or other inappropriate conduct. A Section 9.8 Complaint may not be used for violations of other MIT policies.
What is the difference between discrimination or discriminatory harassment and other inappropriate conduct?
A Complaint based on discrimination or discriminatory harassment alleges conduct that was based on a class or characteristic covered by MIT’s nondiscrimination policy, such as race, color, sex, etc. (MIT’s nondiscrimination policy is found Section 9.3). A Complaint based on other inappropriate conduct does not allege conduct based on a protected class.
For example, a Section 9.8 Complaint alleging racist conduct, harassment on the basis of religion, sexual harassment, or gender-based harassment would fall under the category of discrimination or discriminatory harassment; while a Complaint alleging generalized harassment – not based on any protected class – falls under the category of other inappropriate conduct.
The category of discrimination and discriminatory harassment for the purpose of a Section 9.8 Complaint also includes sexual misconduct (for example, sexual assault and sexual exploitation), intimate partner violence (also known as domestic violence or dating violence), and stalking.
For a list of Conduct Policies falling under these two categories, see Section 9.8.1, Application of Policy.
Complaints alleging discrimination or discriminatory harassment are investigated by the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response office; Complaints alleging other inappropriate conduct are investigated by the Human Resources Office.
Who can file a Section 9.8 Complaint?
Any member of the MIT community can file a Complaint under Section 9.8, including faculty, staff, students, fellows, individuals with visitor appointments, affiliates and any other individual who conducts business with or on behalf of the Institute. An individual who has filed a Section 9.8 Complaint under this policy is referred to as the Complainant. Anyone else – that is, anyone who is not an MIT community member – may not file a Section 9.8 Complaint; they may, however, submit a report and request that the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response office (IDHR) initiate a Section 9.8 Administrative Complaint against a current faculty member, researcher, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (associate or fellow).
What is a Section 9.8 Administrative Complaint?
A Section 9.8 Administrative Complaint is a formal complaint filed by the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office (IDHR) where a concern is raised by a non-MIT community member or by an MIT community member who does not want to be a Complainant, and where, in the judgment of the IDHR office, the concern warrants investigation.
Can I file a Section 9.8 Complaint anonymously or request that my identity not be disclosed to the Respondent?
All MIT community members are encouraged to report any concern about a possible violation of an MIT Conduct Policy. Discrimination or discriminatory harassment can be reported, i.e. brought to the attention of the Institute, anonymously by submitting an online report directly to IDHR. Other inappropriate conduct can be reported anonymously to Human Resources or through Ethicspoint (see below). Making a report of a violation of an MIT Conduct Policy is not the same as filing a Section 9.8 Complaint. IDHR, Human Resources, and local HR representatives can provide MIT community members with information about available support services and resources and about their rights and options, including to file a Section 9.8 Complaint or seek Adaptable Resolution.
If a Complainant files a Section 9.8 Complaint, the Respondent is provided with enough information about the allegations to allow them a fair opportunity to respond. The level of detail necessary to do that varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident.
If the Complainant requests that their name or other personally identifiable information not be shared with the Respondent, MIT’s ability to investigate a Section 9.8 Complaint and address concerns may be limited. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, MIT may not be able to honor a Complainant’s request for anonymity and may need to proceed with an Investigation by filing a Section 9.8 Administrative Complaint.
MIT also offers additional anonymous and confidential options for reporting concerns, including the following:
An anonymous hotline managed by Ethicspoint, a third-party vendor, for reports of wrongdoing or violations of MIT policy. More information can be found at hotline.mit.edu. Lincoln Lab has a separate anonymous hotline. Hotline reports may be forwarded to IDHR or HR if appropriate.
The MIT Ombuds Office is an independent, confidential resource which can help with conflict management but does not investigate complaints and will not provide any information about your complaint to IDHR or HR without your express approval.
The MIT Police have an online form for anonymous reporting of sexual assault, which can be submitted by anyone and does not ask for the name of the victim or reporter.
Who can a Section 9.8 Complaint be filed against?
A Section 9.8 Complaint may be filed against an MIT faculty member, researcher, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (researcher or fellow).
Can I use this process to file a Section 9.8 Complaint against an MIT student?
You may only use this process to file a Section 9.8 Complaint against a student if the alleged conduct violation occurred while the student was serving in a capacity where they were being paid by MIT. Examples include students who engage in misconduct in their role as a Graduate Resident Advisor (GRA), Research Assistant (RA), or Teaching Assistant (TA). All other complaints against students are handled by the Office of Student Conduct and the Committee on Discipline.
Can I use this process to file a Section 9.8 Complaint against another member of the MIT community, like an affiliate, visiting student or scholar, or vendor?
The process outlined here is not used for complaints against visitors, affiliates, or other members of the MIT community who are not employed in some capacity by the Institute (with the exception of postdoctoral fellows, who are subject to this Section 9.8 process). However, an individual should still report a Conduct Policy violation by a non-employee MIT community member by completing and submitting an Incident Reporting Form. If MIT receives a report about a member of the community who is not an employee, MIT may still review and take action in response to the report. In such cases, MIT will generally provide written notification of the allegations to the community member alleged to have violated an MIT Conduct Policy, and an opportunity for both parties to meet with the person who is reviewing the allegation, to submit written statements and evidence, and to respond to factual findings made during the process.
If I believe I am being paid less due to a protected status, like my race or gender, can I use this process to file a Section 9.8 Complaint about discrimination in my compensation?
This process is generally not appropriate for complaints about pay or job classifications. If you have a concern about your compensation or job classification, please contact your immediate supervisor, your local HR representative, or your Human Resources Officer. These individuals can work with the Compensation Office to review your concerns. Human Resources may seek consultation or assistance from IDHR in such cases.
Can I use this process to allege a violation of MIT’s consensual relationships policy (P&P 9.9)?
No, this process is not used for alleged violations of the consensual relationships policy. Please see P&P 9.9 for procedures on how to handle concerns covered by that policy.
Can I use this process if I have a complaint about an academic decision?
Complaints about academic issues are generally handled by the relevant academic department, since academic subject matter expertise is often necessary in resolving such complaints. The Department may seek assistance from IDHR or HR when responding to a complaint that alleges an adverse academic decision was due to discrimination against the Complainant.
Complaints about academic misconduct in research and scholarship follow the procedure outlined in P&P 10.1.
If the allegations concern a grade dispute, the procedure outlined on the Registrar’s website is followed.
Can I use this process to file a complaint about disability discrimination, including a complaint about a failure to provide an accommodation for my disability?
While you can file a Section 9.8 Complaint if you are alleging that you have been subjected to discrimination or harassment as a result of a disability, this process cannot be used to resolve complaints about disability accommodations. In order to request a reasonable accommodation(s) for a disability, students should contact Student Disability Services and employees should contact Disability Services in Human Resources. A complaint alleging failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for a disability follows the a specific grievance process.
Can I use this process for complaints about my performance review?
This process is generally not appropriate for complaints about a performance review, which are usually reviewed by the DLC or the employee’s HRO. That person may seek assistance from the IDHR or HR.
Adaptable Resolution
What is Adaptable Complaint Resolution and why does MIT encourage it?
Not all complaints require an Investigation to reach a resolution. Adaptable Resolution occurs when the Complainant and the Respondent reach a mutually agreeable outcome that results in a cessation of the complained of conduct but without a full investigation and without any finding that the alleged misconduct did or did not violate an MIT policy. Adaptable Resolution can take many forms and may involve a mediated resolution.
MIT encourages parties to start with Adaptable Resolution because it is often quicker and less adversarial. Adaptable Resolution can also provide more confidentiality than an Investigation. However, Adaptable Resolution is not appropriate in all circumstances, for example when one party wants a definitive finding that the complained of conduct violated an MIT policy.
If Adaptable Resolution fails, can the Investigation Process still be used?
Yes. At any time, either the Complainant or Respondent may end the Adaptable Resolution process. If the Complainant had not yet filed a formal complaint, they may do so at that time. If a Complaint had been filed and put on hold while Adaptable Resolution was attempted, the Investigation process can then resume.
Filing a Complaint
How do I file a Section 9.8 Complaint?
You may file a Section 9.8 Complaint either by submitting the Section 9.8 Complaint Form online or by submitting the form in person with the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office. After receiving a Section 9.8 Complaint, IDHR, in consultation with HR where appropriate, will perform an initial assessment to determine whether the alleged behavior would violate a Conduct Policy, if the factual allegations in the Complaint are true.
Section 9.8 Complaints that do not include allegations of discrimination or discriminatory harassment will be referred to Human Resources to be resolved through that office. Complaints that involve allegations of discrimination or discriminatory harassment will remain with IDHR for resolution.
For allegations of discrimination or discriminatory harassment, all MIT community members are encouraged to meet with IDHR before filing a Section 9.8 Complaint. For allegations of other inappropriate conduct, all MIT community members are encouraged to meet with their Human Resources Office (HRO) first. You can find out who your HRO is here: https://hr.mit.edu/hro-list/search.
How will I know if my Section 9.8 Complaint was received?
If you file the Section 9.8 Complaint online form, you will receive an email response confirming that it was received. Someone will follow-up with you and offer to meet to discuss the Complaint.
Is there a deadline for filing a Section 9.8 Complaint?
While there is no deadline by which a Section 9.8 Complaint must be filed, in order to preserve evidence, ensure witness availability, and potentially protect others from similar behavior, MIT encourages individuals to file Complaints as soon as possible after the offending event or incident. If, for example, many years have passed since the complained of conduct occurred or the individual accused of wrongdoing is no longer employed at MIT, IDHR may determine that it cannot undertake an investigation.
If a Section 9.8 Complaint has been filed against me, will I be provided with a copy of the Complaint?
A Respondent is notified in writing after a Section 9.8 Complaint is filed and an initial assessment has determined that the Complaint may proceed. The Respondent is informed of the name of the assigned investigator, sufficient details about the nature of the allegations for the Respondent to be able to respond, and a summary explanation of the complaint resolution process that will be followed. The Complaint itself is not given to the Respondent at the outset of the investigation but will be provided as part of the investigative record. Information about other employees or information not germane to the investigation may be redacted from the Complaint.
Who else is notified when a Section 9.8 Complaint is received?
A Respondent’s supervisor or manager will be notified of the Section 9.8 Complaint. Other offices at MIT, such as Human Resources or the Office of the General Counsel, are generally informed.
If I submit a Section 9.8 Complaint and feel that the person I complained about is retaliating against me, what should I do?
Retaliation against employees (or others filing complaints or participating in the investigation of a complaint) is prohibited https://policies.mit.edu/policies-procedures/90-relations-and-responsibilities-within-mit-community/97-retaliation. A complaint alleging retaliation is considered a separate violation from the violation(s) alleged in the underlying complaint and can also be addressed through MIT’s complaint resolution process. The Institute may determine that retaliation occurred even when the investigation into the underlying complaint does not result in a finding of a policy violation.
If you think you have been or might be retaliated against, please contact your HRO or IDHR.
What if I change my mind after I file a Section 9.8 Complaint?
If a Complainant decides they no longer want to pursue a Section 9.8 Complaint, IDHR will determine whether the investigation should continue without an individual Complainant. In some cases, IDHR may decide to proceed with an investigation even if the Complainant no longer wishes to pursue the matter. For example, if it is determined that the alleged conduct might violate the law or interfere with the academic or work environment, IDHR may decide that an Investigation should still go forward, even without a Complainant. Under those circumstances, the Complaint would then be considered an Administrative Complaint.
Investigations
Who serves as the investigator?
In cases of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, an investigator from IDHR will be assigned to conduct the investigation. In cases of other inappropriate conduct, a Human Resources Officer will serve as the investigator. Both the Complainant and Respondent are provided with the name of the assigned investigator before the investigation begins and are given an opportunity to object to the assigned investigator if they believe the assigned investigator is not or cannot be neutral while conducting the investigation.
I have been identified as a witness and don't want to get involved. Can I decline the request by the investigator to be interviewed?
Witnesses are expected to meet with the investigator, to provide relevant documentation when asked, and to answer all questions fully and honestly. Cooperation ensures that the Institute responds justly to anyone who has been the victim of another’s inappropriate acts and to ensure that any Respondent wrongfully accused of misconduct is appropriately exonerated. Although participants may have differences of opinion, differences of perception, or reasonable differences in their recollection of past events, all participants – Complainants, Respondents, and witnesses - are expected to be truthful during the investigation. Filing a false Section 9.8 Complaint in bad faith or dishonesty during an investigation may lead to disciplinary action.
How much information is shared with witnesses who are interviewed during an investigation?
Witnesses do not receive a copy of the Section 9.8 Complaint and are only provided with information relevant to their own role. Witnesses are generally not informed of the investigation’s findings. Please review the answer to question, "Who is notified of the outcome of an investigation?"
Are Investigations confidential?
During an Investigation, all participants, including the Complainant, Respondent, and any witnesses, are expected to treat the matter as confidential so as not to compromise any aspects of the investigation and to respect the rights of the parties. Even after an investigation is complete, participants should keep in mind the effect that allegations can have on reputations and be respectful of the privacy of all individuals involved. Sharing confidential information in a manner that harms another individual may constitute retaliation prohibited under Section 9.7.
As a Complainant or Respondent, can I bring someone with me when I meet with the investigator?
Yes. Both the Complainant and Respondent can bring someone from the MIT community to a meeting about the Complaint. Section 9.8.5.4 provides further detail on who can accompany you and what role they can play during the meeting.
How long does it take to complete the Investigation?
The goal is to complete the investigation as promptly as possible. The length of the investigation depends on many factors, including the complexity of the Complaint and the availability of Complainant, Respondent and witnesses. MIT is committed to completing an investigation in a time frame that is responsible and appropriate to the complexities of that specific investigation.
What if one of the parties leaves MIT during the Investigation?
If either the Complainant or the Respondent leaves MIT after a Complaint is filed but before the investigation process is completed, MIT generally continues the investigation to the extent possible. If an individual sues or files a complaint with an external agency before MIT’s complaint resolution process is completed, MIT also generally continues an ongoing investigation. However, the process outlined in Section 9.8 may be modified by MIT to reflect the fact that one or more parties is no longer at the Institute, and MIT may choose to terminate an investigation in some cases.
Findings and Discipline
Who decides if an MIT Conduct Policy was violated?
If the Respondent is a faculty member or a senior research scientist/engineer/associate, the investigator prepares a fact-finding report which is then presented to a Faculty Review Panel. The Faculty Panel will review the report and make a finding as to whether an MIT Conduct Policy was violated. The Faculty Panel will also make a recommendation on discipline or other sanctions if it finds there has been a violation of an MIT Conduct Policy.
If the Respondent is a staff member or postdoctoral scholar, the investigator will make findings of fact as well as a determination as to whether a Conduct Policy was violated.
Who decides what action is to be taken if a violation of a MIT Conduct Policy is found?
If the Respondent is a faculty member or a senior research scientist/engineer/associate, the Dean of the Respondent’s School will determine the appropriate discipline, sanction or other action to be taken in response to the finding after reviewing the recommendation(s) from the Faculty Review Panel. See Section 9.8.4.3 for the process if there is disagreement about discipline between the Faculty Panel and the Dean.
If the Respondent is a staff member or postdoctoral scholar, the Dean or other Academic Council member in charge of the Respondent’s unit will determine the appropriate discipline, sanction or other action to be taken.
What is the standard of proof used by the investigator to determine if the allegations presented in a Section 9.8 Complaint are substantiated?
The standard of proof for Investigations is that of a “preponderance of evidence” – that is, information that, compared with the information opposing it, leads to a conclusion that the fact is more probably true than not.
Who is notified of the outcome of the investigation?
The Complainant, Respondent, and the Respondent’s supervisor or manager are notified once a determination has been made as to whether a policy violation occurred. Where the Faculty Review Panel or investigator finds that the Respondent violated a Conduct Policy, the report and finding(s) are also sent to the Respondent’s department/unit head, as well as to the Respondent’s Dean or other appropriate member of Academic Council. See Section 9.8.4.3 and 9.8.4.4.
In cases of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the Complainant and Respondent will receive simultaneous notification in writing of the result of the investigation (including discipline), procedures for appeal (if applicable), any change to the result, and when the results become final.
Why does MIT provide a Review Panel for Section 9.8 Complaints against faculty?
Before the recent revision to the MIT complaint policy, the policy provided for a faculty panel to investigate and determine violations in certain complaints of discrimination or harassment against faculty members. As revised, the policy similarly calls for a faculty panel to determine whether a Conduct Policy was violated, though the underlying investigation is done by a trained investigator.
The role of the Faculty Review Panel in determining policy violations by other faculty reflects the faculty’s role in governance, and particularly its role in the stewardship of academic and educational matters. The faculty as stewards are uniquely qualified to determine when conduct by other faculty violates MIT’s policies.
How are the faculty members on a Faculty Complaint Review Panel chosen?
A pool of approximately 10 tenured faculty members are appointed by the President and the Provost to serve on panels for Section 9.8 Complaints against faculty members, senior research scientists, senior research engineers, or senior research associates. These faculty members are from each of MIT's five schools and will serve 1-3 year terms.
In a given case, the Associate Provost will choose three impartial faculty members from this pool to serve as the Faculty Complaint Review Panel.
Does the Faculty Complaint Review Panel receive any training before considering a case?
Yes, these faculty members receive training on discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, and other relevant issues, including MIT’s Conduct Policies. This training incorporates perspectives from stakeholders at various stages of their education and careers, such as undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs. When a Faculty Complaint Review Panel is chosen for a particular case, the members of that panel will receive refresher training prior to engaging in their work.
As a Complainant or Respondent, can I appeal the findings from an Investigation of a Section 9.8 Complaint?
Both the Complainant and the Respondent are able to appeal the finding of a policy violation in limited circumstances. Section 9.8.4.5. If a policy violation was found, neither party may appeal the discipline imposed on Respondent or other action taken.

Application of Policy
What is a Complaint under Section 9.8?
A Complaint under Policies & Procedures Section 9.8 is a formal complaint alleging a violation of an MIT Conduct Policy, including those alleging discrimination or discriminatory harassment or other inappropriate conduct. A Section 9.8 Complaint may not be used for violations of other MIT policies.
What is the difference between discrimination or discriminatory harassment and other inappropriate conduct?
A Complaint based on discrimination or discriminatory harassment alleges conduct that was based on a class or characteristic covered by MIT’s nondiscrimination policy, such as race, color, sex, etc. (MIT’s nondiscrimination policy is found Section 9.3). A Complaint based on other inappropriate conduct does not allege conduct based on a protected class.
For example, a Section 9.8 Complaint alleging racist conduct, harassment on the basis of religion, sexual harassment, or gender-based harassment would fall under the category of discrimination or discriminatory harassment; while a Complaint alleging generalized harassment – not based on any protected class – falls under the category of other inappropriate conduct.
The category of discrimination and discriminatory harassment for the purpose of a Section 9.8 Complaint also includes sexual misconduct (for example, sexual assault and sexual exploitation), intimate partner violence (also known as domestic violence or dating violence), and stalking.
For a list of Conduct Policies falling under these two categories, see Section 9.8.1, Application of Policy.
Complaints alleging discrimination or discriminatory harassment are investigated by the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response office; Complaints alleging other inappropriate conduct are investigated by the Human Resources Office.
Who can file a Section 9.8 Complaint?
Any member of the MIT community can file a Complaint under Section 9.8, including faculty, staff, students, fellows, individuals with visitor appointments, affiliates and any other individual who conducts business with or on behalf of the Institute. An individual who has filed a Section 9.8 Complaint under this policy is referred to as the Complainant. Anyone else – that is, anyone who is not an MIT community member – may not file a Section 9.8 Complaint; they may, however, submit a report and request that the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response office (IDHR) initiate a Section 9.8 Administrative Complaint against a current faculty member, researcher, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (associate or fellow).
What is a Section 9.8 Administrative Complaint?
A Section 9.8 Administrative Complaint is a formal complaint filed by the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office (IDHR) where a concern is raised by a non-MIT community member or by an MIT community member who does not want to be a Complainant, and where, in the judgment of the IDHR office, the concern warrants investigation.
Can I file a Section 9.8 Complaint anonymously or request that my identity not be disclosed to the Respondent?
All MIT community members are encouraged to report any concern about a possible violation of an MIT Conduct Policy. Discrimination or discriminatory harassment can be reported, i.e. brought to the attention of the Institute, anonymously by submitting an online report directly to IDHR. Other inappropriate conduct can be reported anonymously to Human Resources or through Ethicspoint (see below). Making a report of a violation of an MIT Conduct Policy is not the same as filing a Section 9.8 Complaint. IDHR, Human Resources, and local HR representatives can provide MIT community members with information about available support services and resources and about their rights and options, including to file a Section 9.8 Complaint or seek Adaptable Resolution.
If a Complainant files a Section 9.8 Complaint, the Respondent is provided with enough information about the allegations to allow them a fair opportunity to respond. The level of detail necessary to do that varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident.
If the Complainant requests that their name or other personally identifiable information not be shared with the Respondent, MIT’s ability to investigate a Section 9.8 Complaint and address concerns may be limited. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, MIT may not be able to honor a Complainant’s request for anonymity and may need to proceed with an Investigation by filing a Section 9.8 Administrative Complaint.
MIT also offers additional anonymous and confidential options for reporting concerns, including the following:
An anonymous hotline managed by Ethicspoint, a third-party vendor, for reports of wrongdoing or violations of MIT policy. More information can be found at hotline.mit.edu. Lincoln Lab has a separate anonymous hotline. Hotline reports may be forwarded to IDHR or HR if appropriate.
The MIT Ombuds Office is an independent, confidential resource which can help with conflict management but does not investigate complaints and will not provide any information about your complaint to IDHR or HR without your express approval.
The MIT Police have an online form for anonymous reporting of sexual assault, which can be submitted by anyone and does not ask for the name of the victim or reporter.
Who can a Section 9.8 Complaint be filed against?
A Section 9.8 Complaint may be filed against an MIT faculty member, researcher, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (researcher or fellow).
Can I use this process to file a Section 9.8 Complaint against an MIT student?
You may only use this process to file a Section 9.8 Complaint against a student if the alleged conduct violation occurred while the student was serving in a capacity where they were being paid by MIT. Examples include students who engage in misconduct in their role as a Graduate Resident Advisor (GRA), Research Assistant (RA), or Teaching Assistant (TA). All other complaints against students are handled by the Office of Student Conduct and the Committee on Discipline.
Can I use this process to file a Section 9.8 Complaint against another member of the MIT community, like an affiliate, visiting student or scholar, or vendor?
The process outlined here is not used for complaints against visitors, affiliates, or other members of the MIT community who are not employed in some capacity by the Institute (with the exception of postdoctoral fellows, who are subject to this Section 9.8 process). However, an individual should still report a Conduct Policy violation by a non-employee MIT community member by completing and submitting an Incident Reporting Form. If MIT receives a report about a member of the community who is not an employee, MIT may still review and take action in response to the report. In such cases, MIT will generally provide written notification of the allegations to the community member alleged to have violated an MIT Conduct Policy, and an opportunity for both parties to meet with the person who is reviewing the allegation, to submit written statements and evidence, and to respond to factual findings made during the process.
If I believe I am being paid less due to a protected status, like my race or gender, can I use this process to file a Section 9.8 Complaint about discrimination in my compensation?
This process is generally not appropriate for complaints about pay or job classifications. If you have a concern about your compensation or job classification, please contact your immediate supervisor, your local HR representative, or your Human Resources Officer. These individuals can work with the Compensation Office to review your concerns. Human Resources may seek consultation or assistance from IDHR in such cases.
Can I use this process to allege a violation of MIT’s consensual relationships policy (P&P 9.9)?
No, this process is not used for alleged violations of the consensual relationships policy. Please see P&P 9.9 for procedures on how to handle concerns covered by that policy.
Can I use this process if I have a complaint about an academic decision?
Complaints about academic issues are generally handled by the relevant academic department, since academic subject matter expertise is often necessary in resolving such complaints. The Department may seek assistance from IDHR or HR when responding to a complaint that alleges an adverse academic decision was due to discrimination against the Complainant.
Complaints about academic misconduct in research and scholarship follow the procedure outlined in P&P 10.1.
If the allegations concern a grade dispute, the procedure outlined on the Registrar’s website is followed.
Can I use this process to file a complaint about disability discrimination, including a complaint about a failure to provide an accommodation for my disability?
While you can file a Section 9.8 Complaint if you are alleging that you have been subjected to discrimination or harassment as a result of a disability, this process cannot be used to resolve complaints about disability accommodations. In order to request a reasonable accommodation(s) for a disability, students should contact Student Disability Services and employees should contact Disability Services in Human Resources. A complaint alleging failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for a disability follows the a specific grievance process.
Can I use this process for complaints about my performance review?
This process is generally not appropriate for complaints about a performance review, which are usually reviewed by the DLC or the employee’s HRO. That person may seek assistance from the IDHR or HR.
Adaptable Resolution
What is Adaptable Complaint Resolution and why does MIT encourage it?
Not all complaints require an Investigation to reach a resolution. Adaptable Resolution occurs when the Complainant and the Respondent reach a mutually agreeable outcome that results in a cessation of the complained of conduct but without a full investigation and without any finding that the alleged misconduct did or did not violate an MIT policy. Adaptable Resolution can take many forms and may involve a mediated resolution.
MIT encourages parties to start with Adaptable Resolution because it is often quicker and less adversarial. Adaptable Resolution can also provide more confidentiality than an Investigation. However, Adaptable Resolution is not appropriate in all circumstances, for example when one party wants a definitive finding that the complained of conduct violated an MIT policy.
If Adaptable Resolution fails, can the Investigation Process still be used?
Yes. At any time, either the Complainant or Respondent may end the Adaptable Resolution process. If the Complainant had not yet filed a formal complaint, they may do so at that time. If a Complaint had been filed and put on hold while Adaptable Resolution was attempted, the Investigation process can then resume.
Filing a Complaint
How do I file a Section 9.8 Complaint?
You may file a Section 9.8 Complaint either by submitting the Section 9.8 Complaint Form online or by submitting the form in person with the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office. After receiving a Section 9.8 Complaint, IDHR, in consultation with HR where appropriate, will perform an initial assessment to determine whether the alleged behavior would violate a Conduct Policy, if the factual allegations in the Complaint are true.
Section 9.8 Complaints that do not include allegations of discrimination or discriminatory harassment will be referred to Human Resources to be resolved through that office. Complaints that involve allegations of discrimination or discriminatory harassment will remain with IDHR for resolution.
For allegations of discrimination or discriminatory harassment, all MIT community members are encouraged to meet with IDHR before filing a Section 9.8 Complaint. For allegations of other inappropriate conduct, all MIT community members are encouraged to meet with their Human Resources Office (HRO) first. You can find out who your HRO is here: https://hr.mit.edu/hro-list/search.
How will I know if my Section 9.8 Complaint was received?
If you file the Section 9.8 Complaint online form, you will receive an email response confirming that it was received. Someone will follow-up with you and offer to meet to discuss the Complaint.
Is there a deadline for filing a Section 9.8 Complaint?
While there is no deadline by which a Section 9.8 Complaint must be filed, in order to preserve evidence, ensure witness availability, and potentially protect others from similar behavior, MIT encourages individuals to file Complaints as soon as possible after the offending event or incident. If, for example, many years have passed since the complained of conduct occurred or the individual accused of wrongdoing is no longer employed at MIT, IDHR may determine that it cannot undertake an investigation.
If a Section 9.8 Complaint has been filed against me, will I be provided with a copy of the Complaint?
A Respondent is notified in writing after a Section 9.8 Complaint is filed and an initial assessment has determined that the Complaint may proceed. The Respondent is informed of the name of the assigned investigator, sufficient details about the nature of the allegations for the Respondent to be able to respond, and a summary explanation of the complaint resolution process that will be followed. The Complaint itself is not given to the Respondent at the outset of the investigation but will be provided as part of the investigative record. Information about other employees or information not germane to the investigation may be redacted from the Complaint.
Who else is notified when a Section 9.8 Complaint is received?
A Respondent’s supervisor or manager will be notified of the Section 9.8 Complaint. Other offices at MIT, such as Human Resources or the Office of the General Counsel, are generally informed.
If I submit a Section 9.8 Complaint and feel that the person I complained about is retaliating against me, what should I do?
Retaliation against employees (or others filing complaints or participating in the investigation of a complaint) is prohibited https://policies.mit.edu/policies-procedures/90-relations-and-responsibilities-within-mit-community/97-retaliation. A complaint alleging retaliation is considered a separate violation from the violation(s) alleged in the underlying complaint and can also be addressed through MIT’s complaint resolution process. The Institute may determine that retaliation occurred even when the investigation into the underlying complaint does not result in a finding of a policy violation.
If you think you have been or might be retaliated against, please contact your HRO or IDHR.
What if I change my mind after I file a Section 9.8 Complaint?
If a Complainant decides they no longer want to pursue a Section 9.8 Complaint, IDHR will determine whether the investigation should continue without an individual Complainant. In some cases, IDHR may decide to proceed with an investigation even if the Complainant no longer wishes to pursue the matter. For example, if it is determined that the alleged conduct might violate the law or interfere with the academic or work environment, IDHR may decide that an Investigation should still go forward, even without a Complainant. Under those circumstances, the Complaint would then be considered an Administrative Complaint.
Investigations
Who serves as the investigator?
In cases of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, an investigator from IDHR will be assigned to conduct the investigation. In cases of other inappropriate conduct, a Human Resources Officer will serve as the investigator. Both the Complainant and Respondent are provided with the name of the assigned investigator before the investigation begins and are given an opportunity to object to the assigned investigator if they believe the assigned investigator is not or cannot be neutral while conducting the investigation.
I have been identified as a witness and don't want to get involved. Can I decline the request by the investigator to be interviewed?
Witnesses are expected to meet with the investigator, to provide relevant documentation when asked, and to answer all questions fully and honestly. Cooperation ensures that the Institute responds justly to anyone who has been the victim of another’s inappropriate acts and to ensure that any Respondent wrongfully accused of misconduct is appropriately exonerated. Although participants may have differences of opinion, differences of perception, or reasonable differences in their recollection of past events, all participants – Complainants, Respondents, and witnesses - are expected to be truthful during the investigation. Filing a false Section 9.8 Complaint in bad faith or dishonesty during an investigation may lead to disciplinary action.
How much information is shared with witnesses who are interviewed during an investigation?
Witnesses do not receive a copy of the Section 9.8 Complaint and are only provided with information relevant to their own role. Witnesses are generally not informed of the investigation’s findings. Please review the answer to question, "Who is notified of the outcome of an investigation?"
Are Investigations confidential?
During an Investigation, all participants, including the Complainant, Respondent, and any witnesses, are expected to treat the matter as confidential so as not to compromise any aspects of the investigation and to respect the rights of the parties. Even after an investigation is complete, participants should keep in mind the effect that allegations can have on reputations and be respectful of the privacy of all individuals involved. Sharing confidential information in a manner that harms another individual may constitute retaliation prohibited under Section 9.7.
As a Complainant or Respondent, can I bring someone with me when I meet with the investigator?
Yes. Both the Complainant and Respondent can bring someone from the MIT community to a meeting about the Complaint. Section 9.8.5.4 provides further detail on who can accompany you and what role they can play during the meeting.
How long does it take to complete the Investigation?
The goal is to complete the investigation as promptly as possible. The length of the investigation depends on many factors, including the complexity of the Complaint and the availability of Complainant, Respondent and witnesses. MIT is committed to completing an investigation in a time frame that is responsible and appropriate to the complexities of that specific investigation.
What if one of the parties leaves MIT during the Investigation?
If either the Complainant or the Respondent leaves MIT after a Complaint is filed but before the investigation process is completed, MIT generally continues the investigation to the extent possible. If an individual sues or files a complaint with an external agency before MIT’s complaint resolution process is completed, MIT also generally continues an ongoing investigation. However, the process outlined in Section 9.8 may be modified by MIT to reflect the fact that one or more parties is no longer at the Institute, and MIT may choose to terminate an investigation in some cases.
Findings and Discipline
Who decides if an MIT Conduct Policy was violated?
If the Respondent is a faculty member or a senior research scientist/engineer/associate, the investigator prepares a fact-finding report which is then presented to a Faculty Review Panel. The Faculty Panel will review the report and make a finding as to whether an MIT Conduct Policy was violated. The Faculty Panel will also make a recommendation on discipline or other sanctions if it finds there has been a violation of an MIT Conduct Policy.
If the Respondent is a staff member or postdoctoral scholar, the investigator will make findings of fact as well as a determination as to whether a Conduct Policy was violated.
Who decides what action is to be taken if a violation of a MIT Conduct Policy is found?
If the Respondent is a faculty member or a senior research scientist/engineer/associate, the Dean of the Respondent’s School will determine the appropriate discipline, sanction or other action to be taken in response to the finding after reviewing the recommendation(s) from the Faculty Review Panel. See Section 9.8.4.3 for the process if there is disagreement about discipline between the Faculty Panel and the Dean.
If the Respondent is a staff member or postdoctoral scholar, the Dean or other Academic Council member in charge of the Respondent’s unit will determine the appropriate discipline, sanction or other action to be taken.
What is the standard of proof used by the investigator to determine if the allegations presented in a Section 9.8 Complaint are substantiated?
The standard of proof for Investigations is that of a “preponderance of evidence” – that is, information that, compared with the information opposing it, leads to a conclusion that the fact is more probably true than not.
Who is notified of the outcome of the investigation?
The Complainant, Respondent, and the Respondent’s supervisor or manager are notified once a determination has been made as to whether a policy violation occurred. Where the Faculty Review Panel or investigator finds that the Respondent violated a Conduct Policy, the report and finding(s) are also sent to the Respondent’s department/unit head, as well as to the Respondent’s Dean or other appropriate member of Academic Council. See Section 9.8.4.3 and 9.8.4.4.
In cases of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the Complainant and Respondent will receive simultaneous notification in writing of the result of the investigation (including discipline), procedures for appeal (if applicable), any change to the result, and when the results become final.
Why does MIT provide a Review Panel for Section 9.8 Complaints against faculty?
Before the recent revision to the MIT complaint policy, the policy provided for a faculty panel to investigate and determine violations in certain complaints of discrimination or harassment against faculty members. As revised, the policy similarly calls for a faculty panel to determine whether a Conduct Policy was violated, though the underlying investigation is done by a trained investigator.
The role of the Faculty Review Panel in determining policy violations by other faculty reflects the faculty’s role in governance, and particularly its role in the stewardship of academic and educational matters. The faculty as stewards are uniquely qualified to determine when conduct by other faculty violates MIT’s policies.
How are the faculty members on a Faculty Complaint Review Panel chosen?
A pool of approximately 10 tenured faculty members are appointed by the President and the Provost to serve on panels for Section 9.8 Complaints against faculty members, senior research scientists, senior research engineers, or senior research associates. These faculty members are from each of MIT's five schools and will serve 1-3 year terms.
In a given case, the Associate Provost will choose three impartial faculty members from this pool to serve as the Faculty Complaint Review Panel.
Does the Faculty Complaint Review Panel receive any training before considering a case?
Yes, these faculty members receive training on discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, and other relevant issues, including MIT’s Conduct Policies. This training incorporates perspectives from stakeholders at various stages of their education and careers, such as undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs. When a Faculty Complaint Review Panel is chosen for a particular case, the members of that panel will receive refresher training prior to engaging in their work.
As a Complainant or Respondent, can I appeal the findings from an Investigation of a Section 9.8 Complaint?
Both the Complainant and the Respondent are able to appeal the finding of a policy violation in limited circumstances. Section 9.8.4.5. If a policy violation was found, neither party may appeal the discipline imposed on Respondent or other action taken.

Committee on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and ResponseThe President appointed the Committee on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response (CSMPR) to serve as an advisory body which provides guidance as needed to the Provost, the Chancellor, the Vice President for Human Resources, and the Institute Community and Equity Officer to encourage a safe and respectful campus environment, free from discrimination. The Committee oversees an Institute-wide approach to prevention, and responds to sexual misconduct and other forms of gender-based discrimination.
The 30+ members of the committee represent a broad cross-section of the MIT community, including faculty, staff, and students.

Prohibited Conduct | For Allegations Against Students | Procedures for Discrimination & Discriminatory Harassment
Procedures for Discrimination & Discriminatory HarassmentMembers of the MIT community are strongly encouraged to promptly report all incidents of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, and stalking. Prompt reporting of such incidents makes investigation more effective and enhances the ability of MIT to take action. Any MIT student who believes they have been subjected to discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking, by another MIT student may initiate a complaint by speaking to IDHR Staff or MIT Deputy Title IX Coordinators.
Access the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Office Guide to the Investigation of Formal Complaints of Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment (“IDHR Investigation Guide”).
These procedures generally apply to any allegation of discrimination and discriminatory Harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking brought against an MIT student by another member of the MIT community.
In addition to raising a complaint within MIT, individuals may also file a criminal complaint with the MIT Police, Cambridge Police, or the local law enforcement agency where the misconduct occurred. The standards for finding a violation of law are different from the standards used by MIT in determining whether there has been a violation of MIT’s policy. The filing of a complaint of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking, with MIT is independent of any criminal investigation or proceeding (although MIT’s investigation may, in some cases, be delayed temporarily while the criminal investigators are gathering evidence) and MIT will generally not wait for the conclusion of any criminal proceeding to start its own investigation.
Initial Assessment of Reports Concerning Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment
Upon an initial report to the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office claiming discrimination, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, and stalking, the IDHR Director, or designee, will make an initial assessment of the reported information and respond to any immediate health or safety concerns raised by the report. In this initial assessment, the IDHR Director, or designee, will:
Assess the Complainant’s safety and well-being and offer the Institute’s immediate support and assistance;
In cases involving recent physical or sexual assault, inform the Complainant of the right to seek medical treatment, and explain the importance of obtaining and preserving forensic and other evidence;
In cases involving allegations of criminal conduct, inform the Complainant of the right to contact law enforcement, decline to contact law enforcement, and/or seek a court ordered protective order;
Inform the Complainant about Institute and community resources, the right to seek supportive  measures, and how to request those resources and measures;
Inform the Complainant of formal and informal resolution options; determine the Complainant’s expressed preference at this time for pursuing Informal/Adaptable Dispute Resolution, formal resolution, or neither; and discuss with the Complainant any concerns or barriers to participating in any Institute investigation and resolution under this process;
Explain the Institute’s prohibition against retaliation and that the Institute will take prompt action in response to any act of retaliation;
Ascertain the ages of the Complainant and the Respondent, if known, and, if either of the parties is a minor (under 18), determine whether to contact the appropriate child protective service agency; and
Assess the information provided to determine if it triggers any Clery Act obligations and, if so, submit a Clery Report Form to MIT Police.

Title IX Sexual Harassment
Title IX Sexual HarassmentThis definition of “Title IX Sexual Harassment” is published in the MIT Policies and Procedures, Section 9.5, and the MIT Mind and Hand Book, Section II. To learn more about this policy update, please refer to the letter from Senior Leaders sent to the community on August 14, 2020.
Although MIT broadly prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of sexual misconduct, federal Title IX regulations require MIT to follow specific processes when the Institute has actual knowledge of a report of certain categories of sexual misconduct, referred to as “Title IX Sexual Harassment.”
PDF of Key Facts Changes
Title IX Sexual Harassment means: Conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following
An employee of MIT conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of MIT on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;
Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to MIT’s education program or activity; or
“Sexual assault,” “dating violence,” “domestic violence,” or “stalking,” as defined by federal law and set out on the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR) website.
MIT must follow the specific processes cited below when it receives a formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment and where all of the following apply:
At the time of filing a formal complaint, the Complainant was/is participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity at MIT;
The alleged conduct occurred in an education program or activity controlled by MIT; and
The alleged conduct occurred against a person in the United States.
Formal Complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment are investigated in accordance with the IDHR Investigation Guide and hearings are held in accordance with the Hearing Procedures for complaints against a faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) and in the Title IX Sexual Harassment Hearing Procedures in the Committee on Discipline Rules for complaints against students.
Formal Complaints of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct that do not meet the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment are addressed under the complaint resolution process described in Section 9.8 for complaints against a faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) and in the Sexual Misconduct Hearing Procedures (Non-Title IX Sexual Harassment) in the Committee on Discipline Rules for complaints against students.
MIT prohibits retaliation as set forth in Section 9.7 and the Mind and Handbook. In the context of Title IX Sexual Harassment, this means that: No person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual:
for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX, or
because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in a Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation, proceeding, or hearing.
In addition, retaliation also includes intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX.
Title IX Sexual Harassment Definitions. For the purposes of Section 9.5.1.4 of Policies and Procedures and Section II of the Mind and Hand Book, the following definitions apply:
Complainant means an individual who is reported to be the victim of conduct that could constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment.
Dating Violence means violence committed by a person: (A) who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant; and (B) where the existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the relationship; (ii) the type of relationship; and (iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
Domestic Violence includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the Complainant, by a person with whom the Complainant shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the Complainant as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the Complainant under the domestic or family violence laws of Massachusetts, or by any other person against an adult or youth Complainant who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Massachusetts.
Education program or activity means locations, events, or circumstances over which MIT exercises substantial control over both the Respondent and the context in which the reported sexual harassment occurred, and also includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by MIT.
Title IX Sexual Harassment Formal Complaint means a document submitted by a Complainant, or signed by the Title IX Coordinator, alleging Title IX Sexual Harassment against a Respondent and requesting that MIT investigate the allegation of Title IX Sexual Harassment.  The Title IX Sexual Harassment Formal Complaint must contain the Complainant’s physical or digital signature, or otherwise indicate that the Complainant is the person filing the Formal Complaint.
Respondent means an individual who is reported to be the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment.
Sexual Assault means an offense classified as a sex offense under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Sex offenses include:
Sex Offenses, Forcible: Any sexual act directed against the Complainant, without the consent of the Complainant, including instances in which the Complainant is incapable of giving consent.
Forcible Rape: Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of the Complainant, without the consent of the Complainant.
Forcible Sodomy: Oral or anal sexual intercourse with the Complainant, forcibly, and/or against the Complainant’s will (non-consensually), or not forcibly or against the Complainant’s will in instances in which the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sexual Assault with an Object: The use of an object or instrument to penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of the Complainant, forcibly, and/or against the Complainant’s will (non-consensually), or not forcibly or against the Complainant’s will in instances in which the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Forcible Fondling: The touching of the private body parts of the Complainant (buttocks, groin, breasts), for the purpose of sexual gratification, forcibly, and/or against the Complainant’s will (non-consensually), or not forcibly or against the Complainant’s will in instances in which the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
Sex Offenses, Non-forcible:
Incest: Non-forcible sexual intercourse, between persons who are related to each other by blood or adoption as prohibited by Massachusetts law.
Statutory Rape: Non-forcible sexual intercourse, with a Complainant who is under the statutory age of consent of sixteen-years-old.
Consent means “effective consent” as defined in the Mind and Hand Book, Section II.
Stalking means engaging in a course of conduct directed at the Complainant that would cause a reasonable person to: (A) fear for their safety or the safety of others; or (B) suffer substantial emotional distress.

Review of Sexual Misconduct Policies
Draft Federal Title IX Regulations On July 12, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights issued draft Title IX regulations. Title IX regulations (officially “Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972”) protect people from discrimination based on sex in any federally funded education programs or activities. The previous regulations went into effect in 2020, and MIT responded by implementing a Title IX Sexual Harassment policy while continuing to address other forms of sexual misconduct through a pre-existing MIT Sexual Misconduct policy.  The recently proposed amendments to the Title IX regulations were open for public comment and have now closed.
MIT is in the process of assessing the proposed regulations. If we find that changes to our current policies and procedures are warranted, they will be put in place only when the new regulations go into effect. Any potential changes to MIT’s policy will be guided by our priority of creating a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for our entire community.

Abuse & Harassment Prevention Court Orders
Abuse & Harassment Prevention Court OrdersIn Massachusetts, a victim of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking may seek an abuse prevention order (commonly referred as a 209A or restraining order) or a harassment prevention order (commonly referred to as a 258E order). An abuse prevention order is a court order that legally restrains a family or household member from further harm­ing or threatening to harm a victim.
A harassment prevention order may be requested against anyone who has been harassing, stalking, or sexually assaulting a victim no matter what the relationship with the person might be. For additional information, please see The Massachusetts Court System Website.
The MIT Police and/or Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) can provide information on obtaining a court-issued Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, depending on the nature of the case, but cannot provide legal representation.  A violation of a court-issued order can result in criminal charges and it is enforced anywhere in the United States.  If you have a Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, or similar order issued by any court, please provide a copy to MIT PD.  Once issued, MIT will work with you to make accommodations and to enforce the order.
Protection orders issued by courts in other jurisdictions will be enforced in Massachusetts as long as the protection order is still in place in the issuing jurisdiction. Enforcement can include, but is not limited to, enforcement by MIT Police, City of Cambridge Police, and/or assistance from any other state or local police authority in the jurisdiction where the complainant lives or works. Complainants may request, as part of a protection order, that the respondent refrain from contacting, harassing, or abusing the complainant, stay away from the complainant’s home or workplace, or pay damages to the complainant for harm suffered as a direct result of the abuse of harassment. Abuse and harassment prevention orders also protect against contact through friends, relatives, neighbors or anyone else, or sending or posting messages on Facebook, Twitter or any other social media site, unless specifically allowed in the order. There is no filing fee charged for this action and filing a protection order does not preclude an individual from any other civil or criminal remedies. If an abuse or harassment prevention order is filed, the victim will meet with a Victim Witness Advocate at the court to discuss the process before going in front of a Judge.

Formal Complaint Processes | Information for Complainants and Respondents | Student Discrim
Formal Complaints Against Students: Discrimination & Discriminatory HarassmentThis page provides an overview of the Formal Complaint process for allegations of Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment (excluding sexual misconduct) against a student investigated by IDHR.  You can email IDHR staff at idhr@mit.edu with questions at any point throughout the process.
Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment. The Mind and Hand Book prohibits discrimination and harassment based on a protected class (for example: race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin), and retaliation.
Formal Complaint. A signed, written document requesting that MIT investigate the allegation as part of a disciplinary process. A Formal Complaint can be filed by anyone online. At any time during the Formal Complaint process, the parties could agree to instead participate in Adaptable Resolution.
You do not need to file a Formal Complaint to seek supportive measures. Simply telling IDHR or a Responsible Employee about discrimination or discriminatory harassment does not automatically result in a Formal Complaint.
The Parties. The Complainant is the person who initiates a Formal Complaint and the Respondent is the person against whom the Formal Complaint is made. Together, they are the “parties.”
Neutral Investigator. The Investigator does not take sides. The IDHR Investigators are committed to providing a fair and unbiased investigation process and are focused on gathering the available information.
Advisors and Support Persons. Both parties are encouraged to seek assistance from an advisor. The parties may bring an advisor, who may be any person of their choice except a member of the media or an attorney, with them to any meetings, interviews, or hearings. The advisor may assist either party in preparing their case and in accompanying the party at any meeting or in any hearing. There are trained individuals within the Institute who may be available to be your advisor. The IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide you with more information about seeking an advisor.
Understanding the Complaint. The first step in an investigation is to gather information about the complaint for the initial assessment. This usually involves interviewing the Complainant and gathering information from the Complainant, including documentation and names of witnesses, if any.
Confidentiality/Anonymity. Parties frequently want to know whether a Complainant or witness may remain anonymous during a Formal Complaint. Respondents are provided enough information about the allegations to allow them a fair opportunity to respond. The level of detail necessary to do that varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident, but will generally include the identity of a Complainant, if known.
Interviewing the Respondent. After the Investigator understands the nature and scope of the complaint, the Respondent is given notice of the allegations (including, if known, the identities of the parties involved in the incident, the nature of the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident), alleged policy violations, and has a full and fair opportunity to respond, including providing a written statement and participating in an interview. The Complainant is not present during the Respondent’s interview and vice versa.
Lack of Participation. If either party declines to participate in the investigation, the investigation will continue with the information available. Even without the participation of the Complainant or Respondent, the Institute may still elect to move forward with the disciplinary process depending on the specifics of the case.
Gathering Information. The Complainant and the Respondent will have an equal opportunity to participate in the investigation, including an equal opportunity to be heard, submit evidence, and suggest witnesses. The parties are strongly encouraged to preserve relevant evidence and share all information they have regarding the matter. The Investigator interviews witnesses and reviews all documentation deemed relevant to the situation. All information or documentation provided by either party, or by a witness interviewed in the course of an investigation, may be included in the final Investigative Report and shared with the other party. For more information, read the IDHR Investigation Guide.
Review of Investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, the parties will be provided with information gathered during the investigation and a Draft Summary of the Relevant Facts.  After the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to this information, the investigator will prepare a final Investigation Report—which will include a recommendation to the Committee on Discipline (COD)—and will provide the report to both parties.
Outcome. After receiving the final Investigation Report, both parties will generally have 3 days to inform the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (OSCCS) whether or not they agree with the Investigator’s recommendation. The COD Chair will review the case in accordance with the COD Rules to determine the appropriate resolution method, which may include an administrative resolution or a hearing.
OSCCS staff will provide information about the COD process, possible consequences, and other assistance as you interact with MIT’s discipline process.  Please feel free to contact them at 617-258-8423 or osccs@mit.edu if you have any questions about the resolution process.
Privacy. To the extent provided under applicable law, MIT will make all reasonable efforts to ensure preservation of privacy, restricting the sharing of information to those with a legitimate need to know. Information collected in this process may be subpoenaed in criminal or civil proceedings. The parties are encouraged to use discretion in their sharing of information about the Formal Complaint process.
Supportive Measures. The Institute will provide assistance in changing academic, living, transportation, and working situations, when alternative accommodations are available, regardless of whether there is a Formal Complaint or whether the Complainant chooses to report the incident to campus police or local law enforcement. Any supportive measures, to the extent possible, will remain confidential.
Contact Between the Parties During an Investigation. During the investigation and resolution process, we request that the Complainant and Respondent refrain from contact, direct or indirect, with each other in order to protect the integrity of the process and help ensure that the process remains prompt and equitable. IDHR can put in place a campus issued No Contact Order, where appropriate, whether or not there is a Formal Complaint.
Court Harassment Prevention and Abuse Prevention Orders. The MIT Police and/or Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) can provide information on obtaining a court-issued Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, depending on the nature of the case. A violation of a court-issued order can result in criminal charges and it is enforced anywhere in the United States. Once issued, MIT will also work with you to make accommodations to enforce the order.
Law Enforcement. The Complainant has the option simultaneously to report the incident to MIT Police or local law enforcement and/or file a criminal complaint or to decline to notify law enforcement. A victim advocate through MIT’s VPR office can provide assistance in notifying law enforcement. The Institute will generally not defer disciplinary proceedings to wait for the conclusion of parallel criminal proceedings.
Retaliation. The Institute strongly prohibits retaliation. Complainants, Respondents, and witnesses are protected from any form of retaliation for engaging and/or participating in the investigative process. Anyone responsible for retaliation or threats of retaliation—whether that person is a party, a witness, or any other member of the MIT community—will be subject to disciplinary action by the Institute. Anyone who feels they are being subjected to retaliatory behavior are strongly encouraged to immediately contact the Investigator or the Dean on Call (617-253-1212).
Resources for support. The Institute offers a variety of support services to students.

Formal Complaint Processes | Information for Complainants and Respondents | Student - Sexual Misconduct
Formal Complaints Against Students: Sexual MisconductThis page provides an overview of the Formal Complaint process for allegations of Sexual Misconduct against a student investigated by IDHR. You can email IDHR staff at idhr@mit.edu with questions at any point throughout the process.
Sexual Misconduct. The Mind and Hand Book prohibits Sexual Misconduct (including sexual harassment, nonconsensual sexual contact, nonconsensual sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation), Intimate Partner Violence, Stalking, and Title IX Sexual Harassment (collectively referred to as “Sexual Misconduct”).
Formal Complaint. A signed, written document requesting that MIT investigate the allegation as part of a disciplinary process. A Formal Complaint can be filed by anyone online. At any time during the Formal Complaint process, the parties could agree to instead participate in Adaptable Resolution.
You do not need to file a Formal Complaint to seek supportive measures. Simply telling IDHR or a Responsible Employee about discrimination or discriminatory harassment does not automatically result in a Formal Complaint.
The Parties. The Complainant is the person who initiates a Formal Complaint and the Respondent is the person against whom the Formal Complaint is made. Together, they are the “parties.”
Neutral Investigator. The Investigator does not take sides. The IDHR Investigators are committed to providing a fair and unbiased investigation process and are focused on gathering the available information.
Advisors and Support Persons. Both parties are encouraged to seek assistance from an advisor. The parties may bring an advisor of their choice, including an attorney, with them to any meetings, interviews, or hearings. The advisor may assist either party in preparing their case and in accompanying the party at any meeting or in any hearing. There are trained individuals within the Institute who may be available to be your advisor. The IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide you with more information about seeking an advisor.
Understanding the Complaint. The first step in an investigation is to gather information about the complaint for the “Initial Assessment.” This usually involves interviewing the Complainant and gathering information from the Complainant, including documentation and names of witnesses, if any.
Confidentiality/Anonymity. Parties frequently want to know whether a Complainant or witness may remain anonymous during a Formal Complaint. Respondents are provided enough information about the allegations to allow them a fair opportunity to respond. The level of detail necessary to do that varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident but will include the identity of a Complainant, if known.
Interviewing the Respondent. After the Investigator understands the nature and scope of the complaint, the Respondent is given notice of the allegations (including the identities of the parties involved in the incident, if known, the alleged sexual misconduct, and the date and location of the alleged incident), alleged policy violations, and has a full and fair opportunity to respond, including providing a written statement and participating in an interview. The Complainant is not present during the Respondent’s interview and vice versa.
Lack of Participation. If either party declines to participate in the investigation, the investigation will continue with the information available. Even without the participation of the Complainant or Respondent, the Institute may still elect to move forward with the disciplinary process depending on the specifics of the case.
Gathering Information. The Complainant and the Respondent will have an equal opportunity to participate in the investigation, including an equal opportunity to be heard, submit evidence, and suggest witnesses. The parties are strongly encouraged to preserve relevant evidence and share all information they have regarding the matter. The Investigator interviews witnesses and reviews all documentation deemed relevant to the situation. All information or documentation provided by either party, or by a witness interviewed in the course of an investigation, may be included in the final Investigative Report and shared with the other party.  For more information, read the IDHR Investigation Guide.
Review of Investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, the parties will be provided with information gathered during the investigation and a Draft Summary of the Relevant Facts.  After the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to this information, the investigator will prepare a final Investigation Report and will provide the report to both parties.  The report will generally include a recommendation to the Committee on Disciple, except in allegations of Title IX Sexual Harassment.
Outcome. Generally, after receiving the final Investigation Report, both parties will have 3 days to inform the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (OSCCS) whether or not they agree with the Investigator’s recommendation. The COD Chair will review the case in accordance with the COD Rules to determine the appropriate resolution method, which may include an administrative resolution or a hearing.
Title IX Sexual Harassment COD Hearing Procedures. MIT must follow the legally required processes for Formal Complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment. In those matters, the Investigation Report will not include a recommendation, the hearing will be at least 10 days after the report issues, the hearing will include live cross-examination of parties and witnesses, and, if a party does not have an advisor, MIT will provide them with an advisor to conduct cross-examination.
The results of the COD process will be shared with both parties. OSCCS staff will provide information about the COD process, possible consequences, and other assistance as you interact with MIT’s discipline process. Please feel free to contact them at 617-258-8423 or osccs@mit.edu if you have any questions about the resolution process.
Privacy. To the extent provided under applicable law, MIT will make all reasonable efforts to ensure preservation of privacy, restricting the sharing of information to those with a legitimate need to know. Information collected in this process may be subpoenaed in criminal or civil proceedings. The parties are encouraged to use discretion in their sharing of information about the Formal Complaint process.
Supportive Measures. The Institute will provide assistance in changing academic, living, transportation, and working situations, when alternative accommodations are available, regardless of whether there is a Formal Complaint or whether the Complainant chooses to report the incident to campus police or local law enforcement. Any supportive measures, to the extent possible, will remain confidential.
Contact Between the Parties During an Investigation. During the investigation and resolution process, we request that the Complainant and Respondent refrain from contact, direct or indirect, with each other in order to protect the integrity of the process and help ensure that the process remains prompt and equitable. IDHR can put in place a campus issued No Contact Order, where appropriate, whether or not there is a Formal Complaint.
Court Harassment Prevention and Abuse Prevention Orders. The MIT Police and/or Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) can provide information on obtaining a court-issued Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, depending on the nature of the case. A violation of a court-issued order can result in criminal charges and it is enforced anywhere in the United States. Once issued, MIT will also work with you to make accommodations to enforce the order.
Law Enforcement. The Complainant has the option simultaneously to report the incident to MIT Police or local law enforcement and/or file a criminal complaint or to decline to notify law enforcement. A victim advocate through MIT’s VPR office can provide assistance in notifying law enforcement. The Institute will generally not defer disciplinary proceedings to wait for the conclusion of parallel criminal proceedings.
Retaliation. The Institute strongly prohibits retaliation. Complainants, Respondents, and witnesses are protected from any form of retaliation for engaging and/or participating in the investigative process. Anyone responsible for retaliation or threats of retaliation—whether that person is a party, a witness, or any other member of the MIT community—will be subject to disciplinary action by the Institute. Anyone who feels they are being subjected to retaliatory behavior are strongly encouraged to immediately contact the Investigator or the Dean on Call (617-253-1212).

Formal Complaint Processes | Information for Complainants and Respondents | Faculty | Non-T9
For Formal Complaints Against Faculty: Discrimination & Discriminatory HarassmentThis page provides an overview of the formal complaint process under the MIT P&P, Section 9.8, excluding Title IX Sexual Harassment, when the Respondent is a faculty member, senior research scientist, senior research engineer, or senior research associate. You can also access the Title IX Sexual Harassment page. You can email IDHR staff at idhr@mit.edu with questions at any point throughout the process.
Neutrality: The Investigator does not take sides. The Institute is committed to providing a fair and unbiased review, and our investigations are focused on the information available. We also help both the Complainant and Respondent by providing information about available support services.
Confidentiality: All participants in the Complaint resolution process are expected to maintain confidentiality during the process to protect the privacy of all involved, to the extent possible and as permitted by law. The Complainant and Respondent are provided with sufficient details about the allegations and investigation to allow them a fair opportunity to participate. In most cases, this includes the name(s) of the parties; date, time, and location of incident(s); and information of the alleged misconduct. The level of detail varies depending on the circumstances.
Privacy: To the extent provided under applicable law, MIT will make reasonable efforts to ensure preservation of privacy, restricting the sharing of information to those with a legitimate need to know. Information collected in this process may be subpoenaed in criminal or civil proceedings.
Understanding the Complaint: The first step the Investigator takes in an investigation is to gather information about the Complaint. This involves reviewing the written Section 9.8 Complaint and usually also involves interviewing the Complainant and gathering details, including documentation and names of witnesses, if any.
Interviewing the Respondent: After the Investigator understands the nature and scope of the Complaint and has provided notice of the Complaint, the Respondent is asked about the allegations and given a full and fair opportunity to respond. The Respondent is also asked to provide any documentation and identify witnesses relevant to the complaint. The Complainant is not present during the Respondent’s interview and vice versa.
Lack of Participation: Both the Complainant and Respondent are strongly encouraged to share all relevant information they have regarding the matter. If either party declines to participate in the investigation process, the investigation will continue with the information available. Even without the participation of the Complainant or Respondent, the Institute may still choose to move forward with the investigation process depending on the specifics of the case.
Gathering other Information: The Investigator interviews witnesses and reviews documentation deemed relevant to the situation. In most cases, the Investigator contacts the Complainant and Respondent with additional questions or to request more information.  The Investigator may also consult with other individuals or offices during this process.
Review of Draft Investigation Report: The Complainant and Respondent are provided with a draft of the written investigation report by the Investigator.  Both parties are given the opportunity to provide comments on the draft. The Investigator reviews the comments submitted by the parties, if any, and determines whether the report should be modified.
Final Investigation Report: After receiving the Complainant’s and Respondent’s comments, if any, the Investigator prepares the final Investigation Report.  The Investigation Report contains a summary of relevant information, makes findings of fact, and makes a recommendation as to whether a policy was violated.
Faculty Panel: The Investigation Report is provided to a Faculty Complaint Review Panel, which is composed of three tenured faculty members chosen by the Associate Provost. The Faculty Panel will review the report and may meet with the Investigator, but generally will not meet with the Complainant or the Respondent.  The Faculty Panel determines if the Respondent violated an MIT Conduct Policy, and if so, makes a recommendation as to disciplinary action.
Both parties, as well as the Respondent’s department head, receive a copy of the Investigation Report, any exhibits that were relied upon in the report, and the Faculty Panel’s determination regarding a policy violation. If a violation of an MIT Conduct Policy is found, these documents are also sent to the Dean of the School in which the Respondent works.
Discipline and Sanctions: When a determination is made that a Respondent has violated a Conduct Policy, the Dean of the Respondent’s School determines the appropriate disciplinary action and/or sanctions to take, and the Respondent receives written notification of any such discipline and sanctions.  Please review Policy 9.8.4.3 for more information.
The Complainant is not generally provided with information about any action imposed on Respondent issued unless it directly affects the Complainant, such as a “no contact” order. However, in cases of sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, or stalking, the Complainant and Respondent both receive written notice of the result of the investigation (including the discipline), procedures for appeal (if applicable), any change to the result, and when the results become final.
Assistance during the Complaint Resolution Process: In cases alleging a violation of Section 9.5.1 Sexual Harassment, Section 9.5.1.2 Sexual Misconduct, Section 9.5.1.3 Gender-Based Harassment, Section 9.5.1.4 Title IX Sexual Harassment, or Section 9.5.2 Stalking, the Complainant and the Respondent may bring an advisor of their choice, including an attorney, to any meetings or interviews, as long as that person is not a witness or a party to the complaint. In all other cases, the parties may be accompanied to any meeting by a member of the MIT community, as long as that person is not a family member, subordinate, or attorney. Parties are asked to provide advanced notice if they will bring an advisor to meetings. Advisors may assist in preparing the case and in accompanying the party in an interview but are not allowed to submit material or ask or answer questions on behalf of the party.
Retaliation: The Institute prohibits retaliation.  The Complainant, Respondent, and witnesses are protected from any form of retaliation for participating in the investigative process. Anyone responsible for retaliation or threats of retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action by the Institute.
Interim Measures and Accommodations: The Institute will offer reasonable and appropriate measures if needed for the Complainant and Respondent to facilitate their continued employment or education during an investigation and also during any informal resolution process.

Formal Complaint Processes | Information for Complainants and Respondents | Employees | T9
For Formal Complaints Against Faculty & Staff: Title IX Sexual HarassmentThis page provides an overview of the Formal Complaint process for allegations of Title IX Sexual Harassment (See P&P, Section 9.5) against MIT staff and faculty investigated by IDHR. You can email IDHR staff at idhr@mit.edu with questions at any point throughout the process.
Title IX Sexual Harassment. Although MIT broadly prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of sexual misconduct, federal Title IX regulations require MIT to follow specific processes when the Institute has actual knowledge of a report of certain categories of sexual misconduct, referred to as “Title IX Sexual Harassment.”
Formal Complaint. A signed, written document requesting that MIT investigate the allegation of Title IX Sexual Harassment as part of a disciplinary process. A Formal Complaint can be filed by a member of the MIT community online. An allegation for Title IX Sexual Harassment made by a student against a staff or faculty member cannot be addressed through Adaptable Resolution.
You do not need to file a Formal Complaint to seek supportive measures. Simply telling IDHR or a Responsible Employee about discrimination or discriminatory harassment does not automatically result in a Formal Complaint.
The Parties. The Complainant is the person who initiates a Formal Complaint and the Respondent is the person against whom the Formal Complaint is made. Together, they are the “parties.”
Neutral Investigator. The Investigator does not take sides. The IDHR Investigators are committed to providing a fair and unbiased investigation process and are focused on gathering the available information.
Advisors and Support Persons. Both parties are encouraged to seek assistance from an advisor. The parties may bring an advisor of their choice, including an attorney, with them to any meetings, interviews, or hearings. The advisor may assist either party in preparing their case and in accompanying the party at any meeting or in any hearing. There are trained individuals within the Institute who may be available to be your advisor. The IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide you with more information about seeking an advisor.
Understanding the Complaint. The first step in an investigation is to gather information about the complaint for the “Initial Assessment." This usually involves interviewing the Complainant and gathering information from the Complainant, including documentation and names of witnesses, if any.
Confidentiality/Anonymity. Parties frequently want to know whether a Complainant or witness may remain anonymous during a Formal Complaint. Respondents are provided enough information about the allegations to allow them a fair opportunity to respond. The level of detail necessary to do that varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident, but will include the identity of a Complainant, if known.
Interviewing the Respondent. After the Investigator understands the nature and scope of the complaint, the Respondent is given notice of the allegations (including, if known, the identities of the parties involved in the incident, the nature of the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident), alleged policy violations, and has a full and fair opportunity to respond, including providing a written statement and participating in an interview. The Complainant is not present during the Respondent’s interview and vice versa.
Lack of Participation. If either party declines to participate in the investigation, the investigation will continue with the information available. Even without the participation of the Complainant or Respondent, the Institute may still elect to move forward with the disciplinary process depending on the specifics of the case.
Gathering Information. The Complainant and the Respondent will have an equal opportunity to participate in the investigation, including an equal opportunity to be heard, submit evidence, and suggest witnesses. The parties are strongly encouraged to preserve relevant evidence and share all information they have regarding the matter. The Investigator interviews witnesses and reviews all documentation deemed relevant to the situation. All information or documentation provided by either party, or by a witness interviewed in the course of an investigation, may be included in the final Investigative Report and shared with the other party.  For more information, read the IDHR Investigation Guide.
Review of Investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, the parties will be provided with information gathered during the investigation and a Draft Summary of the Relevant Facts.  After the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to this information, the investigator will prepare a final Investigation Report and will provide the report to both parties.  The report will not include a recommendation or determination as to the outcome.
Title IX Sexual Harassment Hearing Process. MIT must follow the legally required processes for Title IX Sexual Harassment hearing. The hearing will be at least 10 days after the report issues, the hearing will include live cross-examination of parties and witnesses, and, if a party does not have an advisor, MIT will provide them with an advisor to conduct cross-examination. In Formal Complaints against a faculty member, the hearing panel will include at least two trained faculty panel members. In Formal Complaints against a staff member, the hearing panel will include at least two trained staff members. The 3rd panel member will be a professional to assist with conducting the hearing. The results of the hearing and, where applicable, the determination on sanctions, will be shared with both parties in writing. For more information, read about the Hearing Process.
Privacy. To the extent provided under applicable law, MIT will make all reasonable efforts to ensure preservation of privacy, restricting the sharing of information to those with a legitimate need to know. Information collected in this process may be subpoenaed in criminal or civil proceedings. The parties are encouraged to use discretion in their sharing of information about the Formal Complaint process.
Supportive Measures. The Institute will provide assistance in changing academic, living, transportation, and working situations, when alternative accommodations are available, regardless of whether there is a Formal Complaint or whether the Complainant chooses to report the incident to campus police or local law enforcement. Any supportive measures, to the extent possible, will remain confidential.
Contact Between the Parties During an Investigation. During the investigation and resolution process, we request that the Complainant and Respondent refrain from contact, direct or indirect, with each other in order to protect the integrity of the process and help ensure that the process remains prompt and equitable. IDHR can put in place a campus issued No Contact Order, where appropriate, whether or not there is a Formal Complaint.
Court Harassment Prevention and Abuse Prevention Orders. The MIT Police and/or Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) can provide information on obtaining a court-issued Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, depending on the nature of the case. A violation of a court-issued order can result in criminal charges and it is enforced anywhere in the United States. Once issued, MIT will also work with you to make accommodations to enforce the order.
Law Enforcement. The Complainant has the option simultaneously to report the incident to MIT Police or local law enforcement and/or file a criminal complaint or to decline to notify law enforcement. A victim advocate through MIT’s VPR office can provide assistance in notifying law enforcement. The Institute will generally not defer disciplinary proceedings to wait for the conclusion of parallel criminal proceedings.
Retaliation. The Institute prohibits retaliation.  The Complainant, Respondent, and witnesses are protected from any form of retaliation for participating in the investigative process. Anyone responsible for retaliation or threats of retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action by the Institute.
Resources for support. The Institute offers a variety of support services for community members, including:
Ombuds Office: 617-253-5921
Violence Prevention & Response: (VPR): 617-253-2300 (confidential hotline) (for student survivors of sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and stalking)

Human resources professionals in DLCs
Access the complete list of on and off campus resources or the IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide additional information, as needed.
Interim Measures and Accommodations. The Institute will offer reasonable and appropriate measures if needed for the Complainant and Respondent to facilitate their continued employment or education during an investigation and also during any informal resolution process.
More information. If you have any other questions about the investigation or investigation process, please do not hesitate to contact the IDHR Manager of Investigations.

Education | Preventing Sexual Harassment 2021
Preventing Sexual Harassment Training InitiativeAll faculty, staff, and graduate students who are in their third year of study or above are required to complete one of three online training modules to continue their ongoing professional development on promoting an inclusive MIT community and preventing harassment. The rollout will occur in phased groupings through fall 2023-spring 2024. Read below to learn more about the training options, the rollout schedule, and training FAQs.
Additionally, you can find a list of support resources for the topics covered in this year's training.
This training initiative was recommended by the Presidentially appointed Committee on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response and is the follow-up to the trainings rolled out in spring 2018 and fall 2021.

Training Descriptions
In response to feedback received after the 2021 mandatory trainings, this year we are offering three MIT-developed training options—each take about one hour to complete. Participants are required to complete at least one of the training options, through they are welcome to take additional modules.
Option A - LBGTQ+ 101: Education, Allyship, and Self-Advocacy
This entry-level course on gender and sexual orientation is for everyone, whether you’re part of the LBGTQ+ community or an ally. You will hear from senior leaders, staff, faculty, and students on ways you can advocate for yourself, be an ally and how you can help contribute to an inclusive and intersectional campus that supports everyone. We want everyone at MIT to know that all are welcome here.
Option B - Responding to Disclosures at MIT
This module explores the behaviors that constitute sexual harassment, how to support someone who discloses to you, and what constitutes the responsible employee obligation and how to fulfill it. It also highlights MIT policies related to sex or gender-based discrimination as well as the different resources available for those who have been impacted by it.
Option C - Power Dynamics
The Power Dynamics module explores the topic of power in relation to our identities, experiences, and roles at MIT. Power and authority are present in every relationship. This course explores the ways in which power manifests in our relationships and your attitudes towards power, including your feelings about having power and the authority of others. We will additionally review relevant Institute policies and offer scenarios to highlight concepts related to power and authority.
Training FAQs - General Questions
1. What is the training requirement?
All faculty, staff, and graduate students who are in their third year of study or above are required to complete one of three online training module options on the topics of promoting an inclusive environment and preventing harassment. This training initiative was recommended by the Presidentially appointed Committee on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response and is the follow-up to the trainings rolled out in 2018 and 2021.
You will need to complete at least one course to fulfill the requirement; you are welcome to take the other courses as well.
2. When do I need to take this training?
When your training rollout period comes, an email will be sent to you with instructions on how to access the courses. Please check when your group is required to take the course on the course web page. If you have questions, please email pshtraining@mit.edu.
3. May I take more than one of the courses offered?
Yes, you can take all three options. You are required to complete only one to satisfy the training requirement.
Each option was selected in response to community feedback about topics of interest and was created by MIT subject matter experts to reflect the specific context of the MIT community. Courses were developed to bolster our community’s knowledge and build a community of belonging and respect.
4. Who is required to take this training?
All paid faculty and staff, unpaid fellows, and graduate students (third year and above) are expected to complete one of the three online training options to satisfy this training requirement.
Lincoln Laboratory employees are not required to take these trainings—they have their own trainings and will communicate separately to their community (though they are welcome to take the MIT-developed training options as supplemental learning).
5. I was recently hired. Do I need to take this training?
Although you will see this in your Atlas “My Training Needs”, only employees onboarded on or after July 1, 2023 are exempt from this training requirement because they completed a required onboarding training that covers these topics. Though not a requirement, we still encourage these employees to participate in this initiative.
6. Do I need to take the training if I completed this training in the 2021 cycle?
Yes, all paid faculty, paid staff, and graduate students (third year and above) are expected to complete one of the three online training options to satisfy this ongoing training requirement. This training menu is different than the training offered in 2021 and builds on previous trainings by providing multiple options for individuals to choose from to deepen their learning on topics, including LBGTQ+ education, allyship, and self-advocacy; responding to disclosures; and power dynamics.
7. Do I have to complete this training while on sabbatical or junior faculty leave?
While faculty on sabbatical or junior faculty leave do not teach, they customarily continue to conduct research, and may come to campus from time to time. They are, therefore, expected to take the training. If you are on sabbatical in an international location for the duration of the sabbatical and experience technical difficulty with the training, please contact pshtraining@mit.edu.
8. Can I complete the training during working hours?
Yes. Employees should complete the training during their regular working hours.
9. Will we be expected to complete this training every year?
The training menu likely will be refreshed and rolled out every two-three years to ensure that the community receives ongoing training around these topics.
10. Who do I contact if I have questions or concerns about the training content?
If you have questions of concerns about the training content, please contact pshtraining@mit.edu.
11. Who do I contact if the content is upsetting me and I'd like to pursue an alternative to complete the requirement?
Please contact pshtraining@mit.edu.
12. May I return to the online modules in the future for reference?
Yes, all three courses will be available for you to view at any time.
13. What if I don’t have time to take the training in the time allotted for my training group?
Please email pshtraining@mit.edu if you have concerns about completing the training in the allotted time.
14. How do I know if I completed the training requirement?
You will receive an auto-generated confirmation email of that status. Your atlas learning center will also reflect that you have completed the training requirement. Your department administrative officer may also confirm this information through a training status completion report that is refreshed nightly.
15. I have concerns about the privacy of my demographic information. What should I do?
You are not required to provide any demographic information. You may choose to provide this information in the training survey.
16. I hold an unpaid appointment. Am I required to take the training?
No, unpaid appointees are not required to take the training. If you would like access to the courses, please email pshtraining@mit.edu.
17. I am having technical difficulties accessing the training, what should I do?
If you’re having any technical difficulties, please email pshtraining@mit.edu.
Training FAQs - Course Content Questions
1. How do I know if I am a "Responsible Employee"?
You may refer to the Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office (IDHR) website.
2. Where can I find more information about resources covered in these training modules?
More information is available via these online resources:
Preventing Sexual Harassment Training - Resource Guide
Resources for Students, Faculty, and Staff
3. As an employee, what if I have questions about a specific situation involving sexual harassment that was brought to me?
Please fill out our “Notify IDHR as a Responsible Employee” form on our website or email idhr@mit.edu. You can also reach out to the Deputy Title IX Coordinators for local area contacts regarding these concerns.
4. Are we required to report incidents of sexual misconduct for students only or for all MIT employees?
Incidents involving students:
All employees are promptly required to inform the IDHR Office if they learn of incidents of gender-based discrimination involving students, including sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and stalking.
Incidents involving employees:
Managers and Supervisors, additionally, are required to inform the IDHR Office or Human Resources if they learn of an employee they supervise or manage, or a subordinate they do not directly supervise or manage, who discloses they experienced discriminatory behavior on the basis of a protected class including race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin.
While non-managers/supervisors are not required to inform IDHR, we urge all members of the community to inform IDHR of situations involving employees being subjected to discrimination or discriminatory harassment so IDHR can reach out to those employees to provide information about the full range of options available to them, including informal remedies and formal resolution pathways, such as investigations or adaptable resolution. If you have any questions about your role, please email idhr@mit.edu.

Formal Complaint Processes | Information for Complainants and Respondents | Employees | T9
For Formal Complaints Against Faculty & Staff: Title IX Sexual HarassmentThis page provides an overview of the Formal Complaint process for allegations of Title IX Sexual Harassment (See P&P, Section 9.5) against MIT staff and faculty investigated by IDHR. You can email IDHR staff at idhr@mit.edu with questions at any point throughout the process.
Title IX Sexual Harassment. Although MIT broadly prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of sexual misconduct, federal Title IX regulations require MIT to follow specific processes when the Institute has actual knowledge of a report of certain categories of sexual misconduct, referred to as “Title IX Sexual Harassment.”
Formal Complaint. A signed, written document requesting that MIT investigate the allegation of Title IX Sexual Harassment as part of a disciplinary process. A Formal Complaint can be filed by a member of the MIT community online. An allegation for Title IX Sexual Harassment made by a student against a staff or faculty member cannot be addressed through Adaptable Resolution.
You do not need to file a Formal Complaint to seek supportive measures. Simply telling IDHR or a Responsible Employee about discrimination or discriminatory harassment does not automatically result in a Formal Complaint.
The Parties. The Complainant is the person who initiates a Formal Complaint and the Respondent is the person against whom the Formal Complaint is made. Together, they are the “parties.”
Neutral Investigator. The Investigator does not take sides. The IDHR Investigators are committed to providing a fair and unbiased investigation process and are focused on gathering the available information.
Advisors and Support Persons. Both parties are encouraged to seek assistance from an advisor. The parties may bring an advisor of their choice, including an attorney, with them to any meetings, interviews, or hearings. The advisor may assist either party in preparing their case and in accompanying the party at any meeting or in any hearing. There are trained individuals within the Institute who may be available to be your advisor. The IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide you with more information about seeking an advisor.
Understanding the Complaint. The first step in an investigation is to gather information about the complaint for the “Initial Assessment." This usually involves interviewing the Complainant and gathering information from the Complainant, including documentation and names of witnesses, if any.
Confidentiality/Anonymity. Parties frequently want to know whether a Complainant or witness may remain anonymous during a Formal Complaint. Respondents are provided enough information about the allegations to allow them a fair opportunity to respond. The level of detail necessary to do that varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident, but will include the identity of a Complainant, if known.
Interviewing the Respondent. After the Investigator understands the nature and scope of the complaint, the Respondent is given notice of the allegations (including, if known, the identities of the parties involved in the incident, the nature of the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident), alleged policy violations, and has a full and fair opportunity to respond, including providing a written statement and participating in an interview. The Complainant is not present during the Respondent’s interview and vice versa.
Lack of Participation. If either party declines to participate in the investigation, the investigation will continue with the information available. Even without the participation of the Complainant or Respondent, the Institute may still elect to move forward with the disciplinary process depending on the specifics of the case.
Gathering Information. The Complainant and the Respondent will have an equal opportunity to participate in the investigation, including an equal opportunity to be heard, submit evidence, and suggest witnesses. The parties are strongly encouraged to preserve relevant evidence and share all information they have regarding the matter. The Investigator interviews witnesses and reviews all documentation deemed relevant to the situation. All information or documentation provided by either party, or by a witness interviewed in the course of an investigation, may be included in the final Investigative Report and shared with the other party.  For more information, read the IDHR Investigation Guide.
Review of Investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, the parties will be provided with information gathered during the investigation and a Draft Summary of the Relevant Facts.  After the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to this information, the investigator will prepare a final Investigation Report and will provide the report to both parties.  The report will not include a recommendation or determination as to the outcome.
Title IX Sexual Harassment Hearing Process. MIT must follow the legally required processes for Title IX Sexual Harassment hearing. The hearing will be at least 10 days after the report issues, the hearing will include live cross-examination of parties and witnesses, and, if a party does not have an advisor, MIT will provide them with an advisor to conduct cross-examination. In Formal Complaints against a faculty member, the hearing panel will include at least two trained faculty panel members. In Formal Complaints against a staff member, the hearing panel will include at least two trained staff members. The 3rd panel member will be a professional to assist with conducting the hearing. The results of the hearing and, where applicable, the determination on sanctions, will be shared with both parties in writing. For more information, read about the Hearing Process.
Privacy. To the extent provided under applicable law, MIT will make all reasonable efforts to ensure preservation of privacy, restricting the sharing of information to those with a legitimate need to know. Information collected in this process may be subpoenaed in criminal or civil proceedings. The parties are encouraged to use discretion in their sharing of information about the Formal Complaint process.
Supportive Measures. The Institute will provide assistance in changing academic, living, transportation, and working situations, when alternative accommodations are available, regardless of whether there is a Formal Complaint or whether the Complainant chooses to report the incident to campus police or local law enforcement. Any supportive measures, to the extent possible, will remain confidential.
Contact Between the Parties During an Investigation. During the investigation and resolution process, we request that the Complainant and Respondent refrain from contact, direct or indirect, with each other in order to protect the integrity of the process and help ensure that the process remains prompt and equitable. IDHR can put in place a campus issued No Contact Order, where appropriate, whether or not there is a Formal Complaint.
Court Harassment Prevention and Abuse Prevention Orders. The MIT Police and/or Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) can provide information on obtaining a court-issued Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, depending on the nature of the case. A violation of a court-issued order can result in criminal charges and it is enforced anywhere in the United States. Once issued, MIT will also work with you to make accommodations to enforce the order.
Law Enforcement. The Complainant has the option simultaneously to report the incident to MIT Police or local law enforcement and/or file a criminal complaint or to decline to notify law enforcement. A victim advocate through MIT’s VPR office can provide assistance in notifying law enforcement. The Institute will generally not defer disciplinary proceedings to wait for the conclusion of parallel criminal proceedings.
Retaliation. The Institute prohibits retaliation.  The Complainant, Respondent, and witnesses are protected from any form of retaliation for participating in the investigative process. Anyone responsible for retaliation or threats of retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action by the Institute.
Resources for support. The Institute offers a variety of support services for community members, including:
Ombuds Office: 617-253-5921
Violence Prevention & Response: (VPR): 617-253-2300 (confidential hotline) (for student survivors of sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and stalking)
Office of Religious, Spiritual, and Ethical Life, 617-253-7707
MyLife Services, 24/7 hotline 844-405-LIFE
Human Resources Officers (find your HRO here: https://hr.mit.edu/hro-list/search)
Human resources professionals in DLCs
Access the complete list of on and off campus resources or the IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide additional information, as needed.
Interim Measures and Accommodations. The Institute will offer reasonable and appropriate measures if needed for the Complainant and Respondent to facilitate their continued employment or education during an investigation and also during any informal resolution process.
More information. If you have any other questions about the investigation or investigation process, please do not hesitate to contact the IDHR Manager of Investigations.

Overview & Definitions | For Allegations Against Faculty
Overview & Definitions For Allegations Against FacultyMIT’s Policies & Procedures (P&P) set forth Institute-level policies and procedures that apply broadly to MIT faculty, other academic staff, research staff, non-academic staff, and, for some policies, to unpaid affiliates and other members of the MIT community. Institute policies on standards of conduct are found in Section 9; these include prohibitions on harassment, discrimination, racist conduct, retaliation, and violence against community members.
The complaint resolution process for complaints against faculty and staff is described in Policy 9.8. The process is available for any complaint by an MIT community member that an MIT faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) engaged in conduct that violates one of the following policies.
Please note: Although MIT broadly prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of sexual misconduct, federal Title IX regulations require MIT to follow specific processes when the Institute has knowledge of a report of certain categories of sexual misconduct, referred to as “Title IX Sexual Harassment.”
Discrimination or Discriminatory Harassment
A violation of any of the following Conduct Policies, when the alleged conduct is based on an individual’s protected class:
Harassment (Section 9.5)
Title IX Sexual Harassment (Section 9.5.1.4)
Nondiscrimination (Section 9.3)
Racist Conduct (Section 9.4)
Non-Retaliation (Section 9.7)
Violence against Community Members (Section 9.6)
Other Inappropriate Conduct
A violation of any of the following Conduct Policies, when the alleged conduct is not based on an individual’s protected class:
Harassment not based on an individual’s protected class (Section 9.5)
Personal Conduct and Responsibilities Towards Students and Employees (Section 9.2)
Relations and Responsibilities Within the MIT Community (Section 9.0)
Retaliation not based on an individual’s protected class (Section 9.7)
Violence against Community Members (Section 9.6)
Definitions
Administrative Complaint: A Complaint filed by the Institute Harassment & Discrimination Response office where a concern is raised by a non-MIT community member or an MIT community member who does not want to be a Complainant, and where, in the judgment of the IDHR, the concern warrants investigation.
Advisor: A member of the MIT community, chosen by the Complainant or Respondent, who may accompany them to meetings or interviews and otherwise provide support or advice.  An advisor may not be a family member, subordinate, or attorney, nor be a witness or a party to the Complaint. In any matter alleging sexual assault, intimate partner violence, stalking, or Title IX Sexual Harassment, that parties may select an advisor of their choice, including an attorney.
Complainant: The member of the MIT community who files a Complaint. Complainants can be faculty, staff, students, fellows, individuals with visitor appointments, affiliates and any other individual who conducts business with or on behalf of the Institute.
Complaint: A written statement filed online or with the Institute Harassment & Discrimination Response office (IDHR) alleging a violation of one of the Conduct Policies.  A Complaint may be filed by any member of the MIT community (defined in Section 9.0).
Dating Violence: Defined as violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. The existence of such a relationship is determined based on the reporting party's statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. For the purpose of this definition, "dating violence" includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence. Dating and Domestic Violence are prohibited by P&P, Section 9.5.1.2.  MIT’s full definition of Dating Violence is published in the Mind and Hand Book, Section II: Intimate Partner Violence.
Domestic Violence: Defined as a felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or dating/domestic of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the victim as a spouse or dating/domestic violence, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred. To be considered domestic violence, the relationship must be more than just two people living together as roommates. Dating and Domestic Violence are prohibited by P&P, Section 9.5.1.2. MIT’s full definition of Domestic Violence is published in the Mind and Hand Book, Section II: Intimate Partner Violence.
Faculty Panel:  A panel of three tenured faculty members who determine whether there is a violation of a Conduct Policy when the Respondent is a faculty member, a senior research scientist, senior research engineer, or senior research associate. The three members serving on a particular Faculty Panel are selected from the pool of trained faculty members by the Associate Provost.
Preponderance of the Evidence: The evidentiary standard used when making findings of fact.  Preponderance of the evidence is proof by information that, compared with the information opposing it, leads to a conclusion that the fact at issue is more probably true than not.
Protected Class: An individual’s race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin.
Respondent: The MIT faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar who is alleged to have violated one of the Conduct Policies.
Retaliation: Retaliation is any adverse action, harassment, threats or other conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from making a complaint or otherwise participating in a complaint resolution process. Retaliation may occur even where there is no finding of a policy violation, and a complaint of retaliation will be addressed independently through MIT’s complaint resolution process.
Sexual Harassment: Defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when: 1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic standing; or 2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for significant employment decisions (such as advancement, performance evaluation, or work schedule) or academic decisions (such as grading or letters of recommendation) affecting that individual; or 3) the conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would consider it intimidating, hostile, or abusive and it adversely affects an individual's educational, work, or living environment. For examples of conduct that may meet this definition, see Policy 9.5.1.
Sexual Misconduct: Sexual misconduct is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors including sexual harassment, nonconsensual sexual contact, nonconsensual sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. This definition of sexual misconduct includes sexual assault (rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape) as defined by the Clery Act. Sexual misconduct can occur between individuals who know each other, individuals who do not know each other, individuals who have an established relationship, and individuals who have previously engaged in consensual sexual activity. Sexual misconduct can be committed by persons of any gender identity, and can occur between people of the same or different sex.The Clery Act is a federal law on campus safety and security – more information on the Clery Act can be found in MIT’s Annual Security Report. Sexual Misconduct is prohibited by P&P, Section 9.5.1.2.  MIT’s full definition of Sexual Misconduct is published in the Mind and Hand Book, Section II: Sexual Misconduct.
Stalking: Stalking, whether or not sexual in nature, is prohibited by MIT. Stalking is defined as engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others, or to suffer substantial emotional distress. Stalking can take many forms. Examples include, but are not limited to, two or more instances of the following conduct (that also meet the definition of stalking above): following a person; appearing at a person’s home, class, or work; continuing to contact a person after receiving requests not to; leaving written messages, objects, or unwanted gifts; vandalizing a person’s property; photographing a person; and other threatening, intimidating or intrusive conduct. Stalking may also involve the use of electronic media such as the internet, social networks, blogs, cell phones, texts, or other similar devices (often referred to as cyber-stalking). Such conduct may include, but is not limited to, non-consensual communication, telephone calls, voice messages, emails, texts, letters, notes, gifts, or any other communications that are repeated and undesired.
Title IX Sexual Harassment: Although MIT broadly prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of sexual misconduct as described in Policies and Procedures, Section 9.4 and in the Mind and Hand Book, federal Title IX Regulations impose a legal obligation on MIT to apply specific processes when it has knowledge of a report of certain categories of sexual misconduct, defined below and referred to as “Title IX Sexual Harassment.” Title IX Sexual Harassment means:
Conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:
An employee of MIT conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of MIT on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;
Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to MIT’s education program or activity; or
“Sexual assault,” “dating violence,” “domestic violence,” or “stalking,” as defined by federal law and set out on the IDHR website.
MIT must follow the specific processes cited below when it receives a formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment and where all of the following apply:
At the time of filing a formal complaint, the Complainant was/is participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity at MIT;
The alleged conduct occurred in an education program or activity controlled by MIT; and
The alleged conduct occurred against a person in the United States.
Conduct at Conferences
Please note that the Institute expects the conduct of attendees at conferences sponsored by MIT or held on the MIT campus to be consistent with the following policies:
Nondiscrimination (Section 9.3)
Racist Conduct (Section 9.4)
Harassment (Section 9.5)
Violence against Community Members (Section 9.6)
Retaliation (Section 9.7)
Please report any concerns to IDHR at idhr@mit.edu or via our online reporting form.

Prohibited Conduct | For Allegations Against Students | Procedures for Discrimination & Discriminatory Harassment
Procedures for Discrimination & Discriminatory HarassmentMembers of the MIT community are strongly encouraged to promptly report all incidents of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, and stalking. Prompt reporting of such incidents makes investigation more effective and enhances the ability of MIT to take action. Any MIT student who believes they have been subjected to discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking, by another MIT student may initiate a complaint by speaking to IDHR Staff or MIT Deputy Title IX Coordinators.
Access the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Office Guide to the Investigation of Formal Complaints of Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment (“IDHR Investigation Guide”).
These procedures generally apply to any allegation of discrimination and discriminatory Harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking brought against an MIT student by another member of the MIT community.
In addition to raising a complaint within MIT, individuals may also file a criminal complaint with the MIT Police, Cambridge Police, or the local law enforcement agency where the misconduct occurred. The standards for finding a violation of law are different from the standards used by MIT in determining whether there has been a violation of MIT’s policy. The filing of a complaint of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking, with MIT is independent of any criminal investigation or proceeding (although MIT’s investigation may, in some cases, be delayed temporarily while the criminal investigators are gathering evidence) and MIT will generally not wait for the conclusion of any criminal proceeding to start its own investigation.
Initial Assessment of Reports Concerning Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment
Upon an initial report to the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office claiming discrimination, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, and stalking, the IDHR Director, or designee, will make an initial assessment of the reported information and respond to any immediate health or safety concerns raised by the report. In this initial assessment, the IDHR Director, or designee, will:
Assess the Complainant’s safety and well-being and offer the Institute’s immediate support and assistance;
In cases involving recent physical or sexual assault, inform the Complainant of the right to seek medical treatment, and explain the importance of obtaining and preserving forensic and other evidence;
In cases involving allegations of criminal conduct, inform the Complainant of the right to contact law enforcement, decline to contact law enforcement, and/or seek a court ordered protective order;
Inform the Complainant about Institute and community resources, the right to seek supportive  measures, and how to request those resources and measures;
Inform the Complainant of formal and informal resolution options; determine the Complainant’s expressed preference at this time for pursuing Informal/Adaptable Dispute Resolution, formal resolution, or neither; and discuss with the Complainant any concerns or barriers to participating in any Institute investigation and resolution under this process;
Explain the Institute’s prohibition against retaliation and that the Institute will take prompt action in response to any act of retaliation;
Ascertain the ages of the Complainant and the Respondent, if known, and, if either of the parties is a minor (under 18), determine whether to contact the appropriate child protective service agency; and
Assess the information provided to determine if it triggers any Clery Act obligations and, if so, submit a Clery Report Form to MIT Police.

Title IX Sexual Harassment
Title IX Sexual HarassmentThis definition of “Title IX Sexual Harassment” is published in the MIT Policies and Procedures, Section 9.5, and the MIT Mind and Hand Book, Section II. To learn more about this policy update, please refer to the letter from Senior Leaders sent to the community on August 14, 2020.
Although MIT broadly prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of sexual misconduct, federal Title IX regulations require MIT to follow specific processes when the Institute has actual knowledge of a report of certain categories of sexual misconduct, referred to as “Title IX Sexual Harassment.”
PDF of Key Facts Changes
Title IX Sexual Harassment means: Conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following
An employee of MIT conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of MIT on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;
Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to MIT’s education program or activity; or
“Sexual assault,” “dating violence,” “domestic violence,” or “stalking,” as defined by federal law and set out on the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR) website.
MIT must follow the specific processes cited below when it receives a formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment and where all of the following apply:
At the time of filing a formal complaint, the Complainant was/is participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity at MIT;
The alleged conduct occurred in an education program or activity controlled by MIT; and
The alleged conduct occurred against a person in the United States.
Formal Complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment are investigated in accordance with the IDHR Investigation Guide and hearings are held in accordance with the Hearing Procedures for complaints against a faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) and in the Title IX Sexual Harassment Hearing Procedures in the Committee on Discipline Rules for complaints against students.
Formal Complaints of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct that do not meet the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment are addressed under the complaint resolution process described in Section 9.8 for complaints against a faculty member, staff member, or postdoctoral scholar (fellow or associate) and in the Sexual Misconduct Hearing Procedures (Non-Title IX Sexual Harassment) in the Committee on Discipline Rules for complaints against students.
MIT prohibits retaliation as set forth in Section 9.7 and the Mind and Handbook. In the context of Title IX Sexual Harassment, this means that: No person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual:
for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX, or

In addition, retaliation also includes intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or formal complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX.
Title IX Sexual Harassment Definitions. For the purposes of Section 9.5.1.4 of Policies and Procedures and Section II of the Mind and Hand Book, the following definitions apply:

Review of Sexual Misconduct Policies
Draft Federal Title IX Regulations On July 12, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights issued draft Title IX regulations. Title IX regulations (officially “Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972”) protect people from discrimination based on sex in any federally funded education programs or activities. The previous regulations went into effect in 2020, and MIT responded by implementing a Title IX Sexual Harassment policy while continuing to address other forms of sexual misconduct through a pre-existing MIT Sexual Misconduct policy.  The recently proposed amendments to the Title IX regulations were open for public comment and have now closed.
MIT is in the process of assessing the proposed regulations. If we find that changes to our current policies and procedures are warranted, they will be put in place only when the new regulations go into effect. Any potential changes to MIT’s policy will be guided by our priority of creating a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for our entire community.

Submit Report
To learn more about what happens when you submit an incident report, please visit our Reporting Options page.
Reporting just means letting IDHR know something has occurred. It does not automatically trigger a formal investigation process. If what you share raises a concern about community safety, IDHR may assess further, but you as an impacted person never have to participate in that process if you do not want to.
If you’re concerned about retaliation or identifying yourself, you can use an anonymous email address or forgo including your contact information when filling out a reporting form. Without contact information, our ability to follow up is limited. If you’re not sure you are ready to fill out a reporting form, you can also connect with confidential resources who will not inform anyone of what you share without your permission.
If you share some form of contact information, IDHR staff will reach out via email to see if you’d like to set up a time to talk about available resources, supportive measures, and resolution pathways.
