“I believe we should all take the time to understand what constitutes sexual misconduct – because every one of us in the MIT community can contribute to the solution. We need to care for each other, and listen to each other with compassion and respect. We need to intervene when we see someone in a vulnerable situation, or when we sense an abuse of trust and power. At MIT, we hold ourselves to high standards in many realms. I believe we should do the same in how we treat one another.”
—MIT President L. Rafael Reif

Title IX and Sex Discrimination
U.S.  Department of Education
Office for Civil Rights
400 Maryland Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20202-1328
Revised August 2021
Title IX
The U.S. Department of  Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces, among other statutes,  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX protects people from  discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive  federal financial assistance. Title IX states:
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education  program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
Scope of Title IX
Title IX applies to  schools, local and state educational agencies, and other institutions that  receive federal financial assistance from the Department. These recipients include  approximately 17,600 local school districts, over 5,000 postsecondary  institutions, and charter schools, for-profit schools, libraries, and museums.  Also included are vocational rehabilitation agencies and education agencies of  50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories of the United States.
A recipient institution that receives Department funds must operate its education program or activity in a nondiscriminatory manner free of discrimination based on sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Some key issue areas in which recipients have Title IX obligations are: recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; treatment of LGBTQI+ students; discipline; single-sex education; and employment. Also, no recipient or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or its implementing regulations, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in a proceeding under Title IX. For a recipient to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. The Department’s Title IX regulations (Volume 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 106) provide additional information about the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.
OCR’s Enforcement of  Title IX
OCR vigorously  enforces Title IX to ensure that institutions that receive federal financial  assistance from the Department comply with the law. OCR evaluates,  investigates, and resolves complaints alleging sex discrimination. OCR also  conducts proactive investigations, through directed investigations or compliance  reviews, to examine potential systemic violations based on sources of  information other than complaints.
In addition to its  enforcement activities, OCR provides information and guidance to schools, universities and other educational  institutions and agencies to assist them in voluntarily complying with the law.
To learn more about  filing a complaint with OCR, please visit https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html.  For assistance related to Title IX or other civil rights laws, please contact  OCR at OCR@ed.gov or 800-421-3481, TDD 800-877-8339.
On request, this  publication is available in alternate formats, such as Braille or large print.  For more information, please contact the Department’s Alternate Format Center  at 202-260-0818 or via e-mail at alternateformatcenter@ed.gov.  If you have difficulty understanding English,  you may request language assistance services for Department information that is  available to the public. These language assistance services are available free  of charge. If you need more information about interpretation or translation  services, please call 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800- 872-5327) (TTY: 1-800-877-8339),  email us at Ed.Language.Assistance@ed.gov, or write to U.S. Department of  Education, Information Resource Center, 400 Maryland Ave., SW, Washington, DC  20202.

B. Nondiscrimination Policy
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in education and employment. The Institute prohibits discrimination against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, employment policies, scholarship and loan programs, and other Institute administered programs and activities; the Institute may, however, favor US citizens or residents in admissions and financial aid.*
The Vice President for Human Resources is designated as the Institute's Equal Opportunity Officer. Inquiries concerning the Institute's policies, compliance with applicable laws, statutes, and regulations, and complaints may be directed to Ramona Allen, Vice President for Human Resources, Building NE49-5000, 617-324-5675. In addition, inquiries about Title IX (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex) may be directed to the Institute's Title IX Coordinator, Sarah Rankin, Room W31-223, 617-324-7526, idhr@mit.edu. Information about the grievance procedures and process for discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including how to report or file a complaint of sex discrimination, how to report or file a formal complaint of sexual harassment, and how MIT will respond is available at idhr.mit.edu. Inquiries about the laws and about compliance may also be directed to the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Region I, 5 Post Office Square, 8th Floor, Boston, MA 02109-3921, 617-289-0111, OCR.Boston@ed.gov.
*The ROTC programs at MIT are operated under Department of Defense (DoD) policies and regulations, and do not comply fully with MIT's policy of nondiscrimination with regard to gender identity. MIT continues to advocate for a change in DoD policies and regulations concerning gender identity, and is committed to providing alternative financial assistance under a needs-based assessment to any MIT student who loses ROTC financial aid because of these DoD policies and regulations

Background Information
What happens when we receive your report? Upon receiving a report of bias or discrimination, the Bias Response Team’s initial response will be determined based on the information immediately available. The timing and manner in which the Bias Response Team (BRT) addresses the report will vary depending on the initial information provided and whether you wish to remain anonymous.  Generally, a member of the BRT will follow up with you to discuss the situation, review formal and informal reporting options, and explore possible resolutions. Your request for resolution will be strongly considered by the BRT. In the event the BRT determines the reported conduct could be considered a “Hate Crime” under Massachusetts law, the MIT Police will be contacted and will create and coordinate the immediate response plan. What happens if you decide to make an anonymous report? In general, because we are unable to follow up with the reporting party, the BRT will likely take no action regarding anonymous reports. These reports will be used for data gathering purposes. There are some situations where the BRT may take action on an anonymous report. When making this determination, the BRT will weigh the reporting party’s request for anonymity with the Institute’s commitment to provide a reasonably safe and non-discriminatory environment. In cases where the BRT determines action is needed, we will keep any potentially identifying information about the reporting party as confidential as possible. Please note:  The information in this report may become part of the Institute’s record and may be available to the students to which they pertain under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.
