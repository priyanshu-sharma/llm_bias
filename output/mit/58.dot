The Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office (IDHR) can provide individuals with information about resources, supportive measures, voluntary remedies, reporting options, and resolution pathways.\nWe recognize the decision to report is not easy and are committed to ensuring that everyone understands the options available to them and the various ways MIT can address harm.\nIDHR serves as a central resource for the entire MIT community for concerns related to discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and bias. This centralization is part of an Institute-wide effort to streamline informal and formal complaint processes to ensure that a dedicated and well-trained team is available to address incidents and establish centrally tracked incident reports at MIT. Human Resources and managers across the institute are required to consult with our office if concerns about this sort of conduct are brought to their attention and, when there is a formal complaint, it is our office that investigates under the Mind and Hand Book and Committee on Discipline (\xe2\x80\x9cCOD\xe2\x80\x9d) Rules and MIT Policies and Procedures, Section 9.8.\nAfter IDHR learns that an individual has experienced or may have experienced discrimination, discriminatory harassment, sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment), intimate partner violence, stalking, and other unwanted contact, the IDHR director, or designee, will invite the impacted party to meet to discuss resources, supportive measures, reporting options, voluntary remedies, and resolution pathways. While individuals are encouraged, they are not required, to meet with IDHR. Individuals may bring an advisor or support person to this meeting. Any notes taken by the IDHR director, or designee, will become part of the case file.\nIDHR wants all community members to be able to fully access the Title IX process and resources. Please contact the IDHR director, or designee, if you need an accommodation based on a disability.\nIf an impacted party elects not to meet with IDHR, IDHR will electronically send a letter that summarizes the information that would have been reviewed during a meeting.\nSupportive Measures\nThe Institute will offer and implement appropriate and reasonable supportive measures to individuals participating in the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s educational programs or activities upon notice of alleged discriminatory harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation.\nSupportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the parties to restore or preserve access to the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s educational environment, and/or deter discriminatory harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation.\nThe IDHR director, or designee, promptly makes supportive measures available to the parties upon receiving notice, including incident reports, or a complaint. At the time that supportive measures are offered to individuals, the Institute will inform the Complainant, in writing, that they may file a formal complaint with the Institute either at that time or in the future, if they have not done so already for certain allegations. Supportive measures are available whether or not an individual elects to file a formal complaint. The IDHR director, or designee, works with the Complainant to ensure that their wishes are taken into account with respect to the supportive measures that are planned and implemented.\nTo respect the privacy of the parties, the Institute will limit notification of supportive measures to those who implement the actions or who are otherwise affected by the actions. The Institute will implement measures in a way to minimize academic impact on the parties and in a manner that does not unreasonably burden the other party.\nSupportive measures may be offered, as appropriate, to either or both the Complainant or Respondent prior to an investigation or while an investigation is pending.\nThese actions may include, but are not limited to:\nReferral to counseling, medical, and/or other healthcare services\nReferral to MyLife Services\nReferral to community-based service providers\nVisa and immigration assistance\nStudent financial aid counseling\nEducation to the community, community subgroup(s), and opportunities for voluntary individual education\nAssistance with altering campus housing assignment(s)\nAssistance with altering work arrangements for employees or student-employees\nSafety planning\nProviding campus safety escorts\nProviding transportation accommodations referrals\nImplementing contact limitations (no contact orders) between the parties\nAcademic support, extensions of deadlines, or other course/program-related adjustments\nClass schedule modifications, withdrawals, or leaves of absence\nTrespass, Persona Non Grata (PNG), timely warnings (issued by MIT Police)\nIncreased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus\nAny other actions deemed appropriate by the IDHR director or designee\nViolations of no contact orders will be referred to appropriate student or employee conduct processes for enforcement.\nThe IDHR director, or designee, will assess the need for a party to receive supportive measures and will ensure that any supportive measures are individualized and appropriate based on the information gathered. The IDHR director, or designee, or designee, will communicate with the Complainant and Respondent throughout the investigation to ensure that supportive measures are necessary and effective based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 evolving needs.\nFor Allegations Against Students: In addition, regardless of whether a complaint is brought before the COD, IDHR is authorized to take immediate actions that it determines are necessary and appropriate to respond to concerns of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including behaviors related to sexual misconduct (including harassment), intimate partner violence, stalking, or other forms of gender-based discrimination. Possible actions include non-disciplinary, non-punitive supportive measures designed to restore or preserve access to MIT\xe2\x80\x99s education program or activity.\xc2\xa0 In response to a complaint of sexual misconduct, including Title IX Sexual Harassment. MIT can act to remove a respondent entirely or partially from their education program or activities on an emergency basis when an individualized safety and risk analysis has determined that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual justifies removal. This risk analysis is performed by IDHR in conjunction with appropriate Institute officials. In the event of such emergency removal, the respondent will be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal.\nSupportive Measures\nSupportive Measures & ActionsMutual No Contact OrdersResources\nSubmit an Incident Report\nMIT encourages individuals to seek assistance for incidents of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\nEmergency Contact\nMIT Police: 617-253-1212\nUrgent Care: 617-253-4481\nDean on Call: 617-253-1212*\n*Dean on Call reached via MIT Police\nInstitute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n120 Massachusetts Avenue, W31-310, Cambridge, MA 02139\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nQuick Exit\""];

Prompt reporting of such incidents makes investigation more effective and enhances the ability of MIT to take action. Any MIT student who believes they have been subjected to discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking, by another MIT student may initiate a complaint by speaking to IDHR\xc2\xa0Staff or MIT Deputy Title IX Coordinators.\nAccess the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Office Guide to the Investigation of Formal Complaints of Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment (\xe2\x80\x9cIDHR Investigation Guide\xe2\x80\x9d).\nThese procedures generally apply to any allegation of discrimination and discriminatory Harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking brought against an MIT student by another member of the MIT community.\nIn addition to raising a complaint within MIT, individuals may also file a criminal complaint with the MIT Police, Cambridge Police, or the local law enforcement agency where the misconduct occurred. The standards for finding a violation of law are different from the standards used by MIT in determining whether there has been a violation of MIT\xe2\x80\x99s policy. The filing of a complaint of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, or stalking, with MIT is independent of any criminal investigation or proceeding (although MIT\xe2\x80\x99s investigation may, in some cases, be delayed temporarily while the criminal investigators are gathering evidence) and MIT will generally not wait for the conclusion of any criminal proceeding to start its own investigation.\nInitial Assessment of Reports Concerning Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment\nUpon an initial report to the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office claiming discrimination, including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence, and stalking, the IDHR Director, or designee, will make an initial assessment of the reported information and respond to any immediate health or safety concerns raised by the report.\xc2\xa0In this initial assessment, the IDHR Director, or designee, will:\nAssess the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s safety and well-being and offer the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s immediate support and assistance;\nIn cases involving recent physical or sexual assault, inform the Complainant of the right to seek medical treatment, and explain the importance of obtaining and preserving forensic and other evidence;\nIn cases involving allegations of criminal conduct, inform the Complainant of the right to contact law enforcement, decline to contact law enforcement, and/or seek a court ordered protective order;\nInform the Complainant about Institute and community resources, the right to seek supportive \xc2\xa0measures, and how to request those resources and measures;\nInform the Complainant of formal and informal resolution options; determine the Complainant\xe2\x80\x99s expressed preference at this time for pursuing Informal/Adaptable Dispute Resolution, formal resolution, or neither; and discuss with the Complainant any concerns or barriers to participating in any Institute investigation and resolution under this process;\nExplain the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against retaliation and that the Institute will take prompt action in response to any act of retaliation;\nAscertain the ages of the Complainant and the Respondent, if known, and, if either of the parties is a minor (under 18), determine whether to contact the appropriate child protective service agency; and\nAssess the information provided to determine if it triggers any Clery Act obligations and, if so, submit a Clery Report Form to MIT Police.\nClick the following buttons to learn more about different options for addressing discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\nSupportive Measures\nAdaptable Resolution\nInvestigation Process\nProhibited Conduct (Policies)\nFor Allegations Against StudentsOverview & DefinitionsProcedures for Discrimination & Discriminatory HarassmentFor Allegations Against FacultyOverview & DefinitionsProcedures for Allegations Against FacultyPotential Outcomes & SanctionsFAQFor Allegations Against StaffOverview & DefinitionsProcedures for Allegations Against StaffPotential Outcomes & SanctionsFAQTitle IX Sexual Harassment PolicyReview of Sexual Misconduct Policies\nSubmit an Incident Report\nMIT encourages individuals to seek assistance for incidents of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\nEmergency Contact\nMIT Police: 617-253-1212\nUrgent Care: 617-253-4481\nDean on Call: 617-253-1212*\n*Dean on Call reached via MIT Police\nInstitute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n120 Massachusetts Avenue, W31-310, Cambridge, MA 02139\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nQuick Exit\""];

Title IX regulations (officially \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\xe2\x80\x9d) protect people from discrimination based on sex in any federally funded education programs or activities. The previous regulations went into effect in 2020, and MIT responded by implementing a Title IX Sexual Harassment policy while continuing to address other forms of sexual misconduct through a pre-existing MIT Sexual Misconduct policy.\xc2\xa0 The recently proposed amendments to the Title IX regulations were open for public comment and have now closed.\nMIT is in the process of assessing the proposed regulations. If we find that changes to our current policies and procedures are warranted, they will be put in place only when the new regulations go into effect. Any potential changes to MIT\xe2\x80\x99s policy will be guided by our priority of creating a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for our entire community.\nProhibited Conduct (Policies)\nFor Allegations Against StudentsOverview & DefinitionsProcedures for Discrimination & Discriminatory HarassmentFor Allegations Against FacultyOverview & DefinitionsProcedures for Allegations Against FacultyPotential Outcomes & SanctionsFAQFor Allegations Against StaffOverview & DefinitionsProcedures for Allegations Against StaffPotential Outcomes & SanctionsFAQTitle IX Sexual Harassment PolicyReview of Sexual Misconduct Policies\nSubmit an Incident Report\nMIT encourages individuals to seek assistance for incidents of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\nEmergency Contact\nMIT Police: 617-253-1212\nUrgent Care: 617-253-4481\nDean on Call: 617-253-1212*\n*Dean on Call reached via MIT Police\nInstitute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n120 Massachusetts Avenue, W31-310, Cambridge, MA 02139\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nQuick Exit\""];

An abuse prevention order is a court order that legally restrains a family or household member from further harm\xc2\xading or threatening to harm a victim.\nA harassment prevention order may be requested against anyone who has been harassing, stalking, or sexually assaulting a victim no matter what the relationship with the person might be. For additional information, please see\xc2\xa0The Massachusetts Court System Website.\nThe MIT Police and/or Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) can provide information on obtaining a court-issued Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, depending on the nature of the case, but cannot provide legal representation.\xc2\xa0 A violation of a court-issued order can result in criminal charges and it is enforced anywhere in the United States.\xc2\xa0 If you have a Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, or similar order issued by any court, please provide a copy to MIT PD.\xc2\xa0 Once issued, MIT will work with you to make accommodations and to enforce the order.\nProtection orders issued by courts in other jurisdictions will be enforced in Massachusetts as long as the protection order is still in place in the issuing jurisdiction. Enforcement can include, but is not limited to, enforcement by MIT Police, City of Cambridge Police, and/or assistance from any other state or local police authority in the jurisdiction where the complainant lives or works. Complainants may request, as part of a protection order, that the respondent refrain from contacting, harassing, or abusing the complainant, stay away from the complainant\xe2\x80\x99s home or workplace, or pay damages to the complainant for harm suffered as a direct result of the abuse of harassment. Abuse and harassment prevention orders also protect against contact through friends, relatives, neighbors or anyone else, or sending or posting messages on Facebook, Twitter or any other social media site, unless specifically allowed in the order. There is no filing fee charged for this action and filing a protection order does not preclude an individual from any other civil or criminal remedies. If an abuse or harassment prevention order is filed, the victim will meet with a Victim Witness Advocate at the court to discuss the process before going in front of a Judge.\nReporting Options\nReporting to MITReporting to the PoliceEmergency Medical Assistance and Preserving EvidenceAbuse & Harassment Prevention Court OrdersConfidential Resources at MITResponsible Employee InformationReporting to a State or Federal Agency\nSubmit an Incident Report\nMIT encourages individuals to seek assistance for incidents of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\nEmergency Contact\nMIT Police: 617-253-1212\nUrgent Care: 617-253-4481\nDean on Call: 617-253-1212*\n*Dean on Call reached via MIT Police\nInstitute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n120 Massachusetts Avenue, W31-310, Cambridge, MA 02139\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nQuick Exit\""];

The Mind and Hand Book prohibits discrimination and harassment based on a protected class (for example: race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin), and retaliation.\nFormal Complaint. A signed, written document requesting that MIT investigate the allegation as part of a disciplinary process. A Formal Complaint can be filed by anyone online. At any time during the Formal Complaint process, the parties could agree to instead participate in Adaptable Resolution.\nYou do not need to file a Formal Complaint to seek supportive measures. Simply telling IDHR or a Responsible Employee about discrimination or discriminatory harassment does not automatically result in a Formal Complaint.\nThe Parties. The Complainant is the person who initiates a Formal Complaint and the Respondent is the person against whom the Formal Complaint is made. Together, they are the \xe2\x80\x9cparties.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNeutral Investigator. The Investigator does not take sides. The IDHR Investigators are committed to providing a fair and unbiased investigation process and are focused on gathering the available information.\nAdvisors and Support Persons. Both parties are encouraged to seek assistance from an advisor. The parties may bring an advisor, who may be any person of their choice except a member of the media or an attorney, with them to any meetings, interviews, or hearings. The advisor may assist either party in preparing their case and in accompanying the party at any meeting or in any hearing. There are trained individuals within the Institute who may be available to be your advisor. The IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide you with more information about seeking an advisor.\nUnderstanding the Complaint. The first step in an investigation is to gather information about the complaint for the initial assessment. This usually involves interviewing the Complainant and gathering information from the Complainant, including documentation and names of witnesses, if any.\nConfidentiality/Anonymity. Parties frequently want to know whether a Complainant or witness may remain anonymous during a Formal Complaint. Respondents are provided enough information about the allegations to allow them a fair opportunity to respond. The level of detail necessary to do that varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident, but will generally include the identity of a Complainant, if known.\nInterviewing the Respondent. After the Investigator understands the nature and scope of the complaint, the Respondent is given notice of the allegations (including, if known, the identities of the parties involved in the incident, the nature of the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident), alleged policy violations, and has a full and fair opportunity to respond, including providing a written statement and participating in an interview. The Complainant is not present during the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interview and vice versa.\nLack of Participation. If either party declines to participate in the investigation, the investigation will continue with the information available. Even without the participation of the Complainant or Respondent, the Institute may still elect to move forward with the disciplinary process depending on the specifics of the case.\nGathering Information. The Complainant and the Respondent will have an equal opportunity to participate in the investigation, including an equal opportunity to be heard, submit evidence, and suggest witnesses. The parties are strongly encouraged to preserve relevant evidence and share all information they have regarding the matter. The Investigator interviews witnesses and reviews all documentation deemed relevant to the situation. All information or documentation provided by either party, or by a witness interviewed in the course of an investigation, may be included in the final Investigative Report and shared with the other party. For more information, read\xc2\xa0the IDHR Investigation Guide.\nReview of Investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, the parties will be provided with information gathered during the investigation and a Draft Summary of the Relevant Facts.\xc2\xa0 After the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to this information, the investigator will prepare a final Investigation Report\xe2\x80\x94which will include a recommendation to the Committee on Discipline (COD)\xe2\x80\x94and will provide the report to both parties.\nOutcome. After receiving the final Investigation Report, both parties will generally have 3 days to inform the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (OSCCS) whether or not they agree with the Investigator\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation. The COD Chair will review the case in accordance with the COD Rules to determine the appropriate resolution method, which may include an administrative resolution or a hearing.\nOSCCS staff will provide information about the COD process, possible consequences, and other assistance as you interact with MIT\xe2\x80\x99s discipline process. \xc2\xa0Please feel free to contact them at 617-258-8423 or osccs@mit.edu if you have any questions about the resolution process.\nPrivacy. To the extent provided under applicable law, MIT will make all reasonable efforts to ensure preservation of privacy, restricting the sharing of information to those with a legitimate need to know. Information collected in this process may be subpoenaed in criminal or civil proceedings. The parties are encouraged to use discretion in their sharing of information about the Formal Complaint process.\nSupportive Measures. The Institute will provide assistance in changing academic, living, transportation, and working situations, when alternative accommodations are available, regardless of whether there is a Formal Complaint or whether the Complainant chooses to report the incident to campus police or local law enforcement. Any supportive measures, to the extent possible, will remain confidential.\nContact Between the Parties During an Investigation. During the investigation and resolution process, we request that the Complainant and Respondent refrain from contact, direct or indirect, with each other in order to protect the integrity of the process and help ensure that the process remains prompt and equitable. IDHR can put in place a campus issued No Contact Order, where appropriate, whether or not there is a Formal Complaint.\nCourt Harassment Prevention and Abuse Prevention Orders. The MIT Police and/or Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) can provide information on obtaining a court-issued Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, depending on the nature of the case. A violation of a court-issued order can result in criminal charges and it is enforced anywhere in the United States. Once issued, MIT will also work with you to make accommodations to enforce the order.\nLaw Enforcement. The Complainant has the option simultaneously to report the incident to MIT Police or local law enforcement and/or file a criminal complaint or to decline to notify law enforcement. A victim advocate through MIT\xe2\x80\x99s VPR office can provide assistance in notifying law enforcement. The Institute will generally not defer disciplinary proceedings to wait for the conclusion of parallel criminal proceedings.\nRetaliation. The Institute strongly prohibits retaliation. Complainants, Respondents, and witnesses are protected from any form of retaliation for engaging and/or participating in the investigative process. Anyone responsible for retaliation or threats of retaliation\xe2\x80\x94whether that person is a party, a witness, or any other member of the MIT community\xe2\x80\x94will be subject to disciplinary action by the Institute. Anyone who feels they are being subjected to retaliatory behavior are strongly encouraged to immediately contact the Investigator or the Dean on Call (617-253-1212).\nResources for support. The Institute offers a variety of support services to students.\nConfidential Resources: \xe2\x80\x9cI want to think through my situation with someone who can keep my information as confidential as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMental Health and Counseling: 617-253-2916/ 617-253-4481 (nights/weekends)\nMIT Medical: 617-253-1311\nOmbuds Office: 617-253-5921\nMIT Office of Religious, Spiritual, and Ethical Life: http://studentlife.mit.edu/rl/mit-chaplains\nViolence Prevention and Response (VPR): 617-253-2300 \xc2\xa0(confidential hotline) (for student survivors of sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and stalking)\nMyLife Services (for staff and faculty) 844-405-LIFE (24/7 hotline)\nPrivate Resources: \xe2\x80\x9cI need to confide in someone and it is okay if that person needs to tell the IDHR Director.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStudent Support Services (for undergraduates): 617-253-4861\nOffice of Graduate Education: 617-253-4860\nAccess the complete list of on and off campus resources or the IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide additional information, as needed.\nReasonable Accommodations.

The Institute is committed to providing a fair and unbiased review, and our investigations are focused on the information available. We also help both the Complainant and Respondent by providing information about available support services.\nConfidentiality:\xc2\xa0All participants in the Complaint resolution process are expected to maintain confidentiality during the process to protect the privacy of all involved, to the extent possible and as permitted by law. The Complainant and Respondent are provided with sufficient details about the allegations and investigation to allow them a fair opportunity to participate.

The level of detail varies depending on the circumstances.\nPrivacy:\xc2\xa0To the extent provided under applicable law, MIT will make reasonable efforts to ensure preservation of privacy, restricting the sharing of information to those with a legitimate need to know. Information collected in this process may be subpoenaed in criminal or civil proceedings.\nUnderstanding the Complaint:\xc2\xa0The first step the Investigator takes in an investigation is to gather information about the Complaint. This involves reviewing the written Section 9.8 Complaint and usually also involves interviewing the Complainant and gathering details, including documentation and names of witnesses, if any.\nInterviewing the Respondent:\xc2\xa0After the Investigator understands the nature and scope of the Complaint and has provided notice of the Complaint, the Respondent is asked about the allegations and given a full and fair opportunity to respond.

If a violation of an MIT Conduct Policy is found, these documents are also sent to the Dean of the School in which the Respondent works.\nDiscipline\xc2\xa0and Sanctions:\xc2\xa0When a determination is made that a Respondent has violated a Conduct Policy, the Dean of the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s School determines the appropriate disciplinary action and/or sanctions to take, and the Respondent receives written notification of any such discipline and sanctions.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Please review Policy 9.8.4.3 for more information.\nThe Complainant is not generally provided with information about any action imposed on Respondent issued unless it directly affects the Complainant, such as a \xe2\x80\x9cno contact\xe2\x80\x9d order. However, in\xc2\xa0cases of sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, or stalking, the Complainant and Respondent both receive written notice of the result of the investigation (including the discipline), procedures for appeal (if applicable), any change to the result, and when the results become final.\nAssistance during the Complaint Resolution Process:\xc2\xa0In cases alleging a violation of\xc2\xa0Section 9.5.1\xc2\xa0Sexual Harassment,\xc2\xa0Section 9.5.1.2\xc2\xa0Sexual Misconduct,\xc2\xa0Section 9.5.1.3\xc2\xa0Gender-Based Harassment,\xc2\xa0Section 9.5.1.4\xc2\xa0Title IX Sexual Harassment, or\xc2\xa0Section 9.5.2\xc2\xa0Stalking, the Complainant and the Respondent may bring an advisor of their choice, including an attorney, to any meetings or interviews, as long as that person is not a witness or a party to the complaint. In all other cases, the parties may be accompanied to any meeting by a member of the MIT community, as long as that person is not a family member, subordinate, or attorney.

The advisor may assist either party in preparing their case and in accompanying the party at any meeting or in any hearing. There are trained individuals within the Institute who may be available to be your advisor. The IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide you with more information about seeking an advisor.\nUnderstanding the Complaint. The first step in an investigation is to gather information about the complaint for the \xe2\x80\x9cInitial Assessment.\" This usually involves interviewing the Complainant and gathering information from the Complainant, including documentation and names of witnesses, if any.\nConfidentiality/Anonymity. Parties frequently want to know whether a Complainant or witness may remain anonymous during a Formal Complaint. Respondents are provided enough information about the allegations to allow them a fair opportunity to respond. The level of detail necessary to do that varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident, but will include the identity of a Complainant, if known.\nInterviewing the Respondent. After the Investigator understands the nature and scope of the complaint, the Respondent is given notice of the allegations (including, if known, the identities of the parties involved in the incident, the nature of the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident), alleged policy violations, and has a full and fair opportunity to respond, including providing a written statement and participating in an interview. The Complainant is not present during the Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interview and vice versa.\nLack of Participation. If either party declines to participate in the investigation, the investigation will continue with the information available. Even without the participation of the Complainant or Respondent, the Institute may still elect to move forward with the disciplinary process depending on the specifics of the case.\nGathering Information. The Complainant and the Respondent will have an equal opportunity to participate in the investigation, including an equal opportunity to be heard, submit evidence, and suggest witnesses. The parties are strongly encouraged to preserve relevant evidence and share all information they have regarding the matter. The Investigator interviews witnesses and reviews all documentation deemed relevant to the situation. All information or documentation provided by either party, or by a witness interviewed in the course of an investigation, may be included in the final Investigative Report and shared with the other party.\xc2\xa0 For more information, read\xc2\xa0the IDHR Investigation Guide.\nReview of Investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, the parties will be provided with information gathered during the investigation and a Draft Summary of the Relevant Facts.\xc2\xa0 After the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to this information, the investigator will prepare a final Investigation Report and will provide the report to both parties.\xc2\xa0 The report will not include a recommendation or determination as to the outcome.\nTitle IX Sexual Harassment Hearing Process. MIT must follow the legally required processes for Title IX Sexual Harassment hearing. The hearing will be at least 10 days after the report issues, the hearing will include live cross-examination of parties and witnesses, and, if a party does not have an advisor, MIT will provide them with an advisor to conduct cross-examination. In Formal Complaints against a faculty member, the hearing panel will include at least two trained faculty panel members. In Formal Complaints against a staff member, the hearing panel will include at least two trained staff members. The 3rd panel member will be a professional to assist with conducting the hearing. The results of the hearing and, where applicable, the determination on sanctions, will be shared with both parties in writing. For more information, read about the\xc2\xa0Hearing Process.\nPrivacy. To the extent provided under applicable law, MIT will make all reasonable efforts to ensure preservation of privacy, restricting the sharing of information to those with a legitimate need to know. Information collected in this process may be subpoenaed in criminal or civil proceedings. The parties are encouraged to use discretion in their sharing of information about the Formal Complaint process.\nSupportive Measures. The Institute will provide assistance in changing academic, living, transportation, and working situations, when alternative accommodations are available, regardless of whether there is a Formal Complaint or whether the Complainant chooses to report the incident to campus police or local law enforcement. Any supportive measures, to the extent possible, will remain confidential.\nContact Between the Parties During an Investigation. During the investigation and resolution process, we request that the Complainant and Respondent refrain from contact, direct or indirect, with each other in order to protect the integrity of the process and help ensure that the process remains prompt and equitable. IDHR can put in place a campus issued No Contact Order, where appropriate, whether or not there is a Formal Complaint.\nCourt Harassment Prevention and Abuse Prevention Orders. The MIT Police and/or Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) can provide information on obtaining a court-issued Harassment Prevention Order or Abuse Prevention Order, depending on the nature of the case. A violation of a court-issued order can result in criminal charges and it is enforced anywhere in the United States. Once issued, MIT will also work with you to make accommodations to enforce the order.\nLaw Enforcement. The Complainant has the option simultaneously to report the incident to MIT Police or local law enforcement and/or file a criminal complaint or to decline to notify law enforcement. A victim advocate through MIT\xe2\x80\x99s VPR office can provide assistance in notifying law enforcement. The Institute will generally not defer disciplinary proceedings to wait for the conclusion of parallel criminal proceedings.\nRetaliation.\xc2\xa0The Institute prohibits retaliation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Complainant, Respondent, and witnesses are protected from any form of retaliation for participating in the investigative process. Anyone responsible for retaliation or threats of retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action by the Institute.\nResources for support. The Institute offers a variety of support services for community members, including:\nOmbuds Office: 617-253-5921\nViolence Prevention & Response: (VPR): 617-253-2300 (confidential hotline) (for student survivors of sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and stalking)\nOffice of Religious, Spiritual, and Ethical Life, 617-253-7707\nMyLife Services, 24/7 hotline 844-405-LIFE\nHuman Resources Officers (find your HRO here:\xc2\xa0https://hr.mit.edu/hro-list/search)\nHuman resources professionals in DLCs\nAccess the complete list of on and off campus resources or the IDHR Director or Case Manager can provide additional information, as needed.\nInterim Measures and Accommodations.\xc2\xa0The Institute will offer reasonable and appropriate measures if needed for the Complainant and Respondent to facilitate their continued employment or education during an investigation and also during any informal resolution process.\nMore information.

We will additionally review relevant Institute policies and offer scenarios to highlight concepts related to power and authority.\nTraining FAQs - General Questions\n1. What is the training requirement?\nAll faculty, staff, and graduate students who are in their third year of study or above are required to complete one of three online training module options on the topics of promoting an inclusive environment and preventing harassment.

It does not automatically trigger a formal investigation process. If what you share raises a concern about community safety, IDHR may assess further, but you as an impacted person never have to participate in that process if you do not want to.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about retaliation or identifying yourself, you can use an anonymous email address or forgo including your contact information when filling out a reporting form. Without contact information, our ability to follow up is limited. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure you are ready to fill out a reporting form, you can also connect with confidential resources who will not inform anyone of what you share without your permission.\nIf you share some form of contact information, IDHR staff will reach out via email to see if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to set up a time to talk about available resources, supportive measures, and resolution pathways.\nCOVID-19 Amnesty Policy:\nMIT recognizes that there may be circumstances in which the potential for disciplinary action for violations of Covid-19 Student Life policies could act as a barrier to students who want to seek critical assistance for themselves or others and/or report an incident involving a serious violation of Institute policy. Learn more about our amnesty policies for Graduate Students and Undergraduate Students.\nProhibited discrimination and discriminatory harassment that you can report through these forms include:\nDiscrimination on the basis of a protected class (i.e. race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, or national or ethnic origin)\nRacist Conduct\nHarassment on the basis of a protected class\nSexual Harassment\nSexual Assault\nIntimate Partner Violence\nStalking\nViolence on the basis of a protected class\nRetaliation regarding discrimination on the basis of protected class\nSubmit an Incident Report\nMIT encourages individuals to seek assistance for incidents of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\nEmergency Contact\nMIT Police: 617-253-1212\nUrgent Care: 617-253-4481\nDean on Call: 617-253-1212*\n*Dean on Call reached via MIT Police\nInstitute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n120 Massachusetts Avenue, W31-310, Cambridge, MA 02139\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nQuick Exit\""];
