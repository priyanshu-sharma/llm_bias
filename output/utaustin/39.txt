Title IX
The University and the Law School are committed to creating and fostering a campus environment free from all forms of sex discrimination. Title IX, as well as state law and university policy, protect all members of our campus community who experience sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), stalking, or discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.
The University’s Title IX Office, Office for Inclusion and Equity, and Department of Investigation and Adjudication are responsible for investigating all Title IX reports at UT Austin. The Law School does not have its own Title IX process. Any Title IX incident involving law students, faculty, or staff must be reported to and addressed by the University’s Title IX Office.
File a Title IX Report
Assistant Dean Elizabeth Bangs has received comprehensive Title IX training and is available to provide resources and support. Any student with questions or concerns about Title IX is welcome and encouraged to contact either Dean Bangs or the Title IX office.
Mandatory Reporters
All University employees (both faculty and staff) who are not designated as Confidential Resources are required to promptly report any knowledge of any incidents of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, or stalking “committed by or against a person who was a student enrolled at or an employee of the institution at the time of the incident.” Texas Education Code 51.252.  If you disclose a Title IX incident to a faculty or staff member, they are required to report the incident to the University’s Title IX Office. As a student, you always have the option to request a dismissal of the investigation or be a Reluctant Complainant in the investigation process, which means you don’t have to participate in the investigation.
Not ready to file a report?
If you have been subject to or have become aware of a possible Title IX violation, but you are not ready to file a report or pursue the grievance process, the University has designated a number of Confidential Resources. These are staff members who are not required to report Title IX incidents that are disclosed to them. They include the providers at the Counseling and Mental Health Center and trained, professional Advocates in the Student Emergency Services Office. When meeting with a confidential support person, you may share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. Confidential Resources are available to help by:
Offering a safe and private setting to discuss questions, concerns, and experiences;
Providing information about your rights and options regarding the Title IX reporting and investigation process;
Exploring academic, housing, medical, and or/ financial accommodations and remedies; and
Referring you to other on- and off-campus resources.
File a Title IX Report
If you have been subject to a possible Title IX violation — or are concerned about a possible violation you have witnessed or become aware of — and wish to initiate the grievance process, you may file a report directly with the Title IX Office or meet with Dean Bangs for assistance in filing a report.
Why report?
The incident has negatively affected your academics or employment.
You have concerns about your safety or the safety of the community.
You need someone to confide in or want to seek assistance and support, even if you are not seeking action or do not want to name the Respondent.
You want the University to pursue disciplinary action against the Respondent.
You want a No Contact Directive to be put in place between you and the Respondent.
Reporting an incident informs the University of the incident, which allows the institution to provide support, resources, and accommodations to all the parties impacted by the incident and does not necessarily result in the initiation of a grievance process.
What happens next?
If you choose to file a Formal Complaint (a request that the University initiate an investigation and possible disciplinary action), the Title IX Office will reach out to both parties to discuss next steps and provide information on specific resources and accommodations related to the Formal Complaint. The Title IX Office will then initiate the appropriate Grievance Process.
Confidentiality
All reports are treated with the greatest degree of confidentiality possible. Confidentiality is maintained on a need-to-know basis with respect to the University’s obligations to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct and take the appropriate corrective action.
Members of the University community will not be informed of the outcome of a Title IX investigation to which they are not a party.
Consensual Relationships Policy
The University’s Consensual Relationships Policy prohibits consensual relationships between:
employees (including faculty) or affiliates and any graduate student whom that individual teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way; and
student employees and any student whom that student employee teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way.
Accommodations for Pregnancy, Nursing, and Parenting
Title IX also prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and parenting status. The University and Law School provide reasonable accommodations due to pregnancy and parenting needs. If you are seeking pregnancy and parenting-related accommodations, make an appointment with Assistant Dean Elizabeth Bangs. You may also contact the University’s Title IX Office.
JON 5.226 and 6.226 and TNH 3.107 are lactation rooms available for student use. (The JON rooms are available only during regular business hours.) Please contact the Student Affairs Office or the Human Resources Office for the door codes.

History of Texas Law
The University of Texas School of Law began as The University of Texas at Austin’s Department of Law when the university was founded in 1883. The law school started with two professors and 52 students in the basement of the university’s Old Main Building. The school has since grown to more than 900 students and offers the Doctor of Jurisprudence (J.D.) and the Master of Laws (LL.M.).
On July 1, 2022, Robert (Bobby) Chesney became Dean, taking over the role from Ward Farnsworth who served as Dean for 10 years. The Department of Law appointed its first dean, John C. Townes, in 1901, and moved out of the basement and into its own building in 1908. The Department of Law became The University of Texas School of Law in 1920. By 1935, it had become one of the largest law schools in the United States, and required a new building. In 1952 construction began on Townes Hall. Two additional buildings were later added: Jones Hall, completed in 1981, which became home to the Tarlton Law Library, which houses the Susman Academic Center; and the Connally Center, dedicated in 2001, which houses the Eidman Courtroom, the Advocacy Program and much of the Clinical Program. In 2021, renovations to outdoor spaces to the north side of Townes Hall included the Patman Family Plaza and Dee J. Kelly Courtyard.
Clinical legal education at the School of Law began in 1974, and has steadily expanded. Today, there are more than 15 different legal clinics as well as numerous internship programs that provide extensive opportunities to work on legal issues in real-world settings. Clinics have allowed students to represent clients in misdemeanor proceedings, attend oral arguments in the United States Supreme Court of cases they worked on, represent families seeking asylum, and assist victims of domestic violence, to name only a few examples.
The Advocacy Program was founded in 1978 to facilitate the teaching of advocacy at Texas Law. The program supports both academic courses and extracurricular competitions and activities in the advocacy field. Texas Law student teams have won numerous regional and national advocacy championships, with hundreds of students participating annually in mock trial, moot court, transactional, and dispute resolution competitions.

Helping Jamaica Write a Constitution
Global constitutional expert Richard Albert has seen his research relied upon numerous times in countries around the world reviewing or rewriting their constitutions. In 2021, he advised the Constitutional Convention of Chile on designing procedures of constitutional reform for the country’s proposed constitution. And in 2022, the Supreme Court of Kenya relied extensively on his theory of constitutional dismemberment in its decision on a major dispute over a constitutional reform.
Now, Prof. Albert is helping Jamaica—the country where his parents met and his great-great-grandfather was born—in its transition from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. Albert is one of 15 people appointed by the Jamaican Prime Minister to serve on the Constitution Reform Committee, helping to lay the groundwork for a new governmental framework.
According to Albert, the CRC has three objectives. “One, to replace the King with a Jamaican Head of State,” says Albert. “Two, to modernize the country’s constitutional arrangements. And three, to patriate the Constitution – to bring it home, at last, from the United Kingdom.”

Public Accommodations and Civil Rights
Within minutes of the announcement of the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion in 303 Creative v. Elenis, Prof. Elizabeth Sepper found herself on the radio explaining the potentially far-reaching implications of the court’s decision and her concerns about them. “The central issue was whether states can apply anti-discrimination law to a commercial business that uses some expression in the production of their products. The court said, no, that the free speech clause bars that application. And that applies across the nation to applications of public accommodations anti-discrimination laws, and potentially further into other areas of anti-discrimination law.”
Sepper, one of the nation’s foremost experts on public accommodations laws, was cited in Justice Sotomayor’s dissent in 303 Creative. She has written extensively on how the history of anti-discrimination laws relates to current conflicts between these laws and the rights of free speech and free exercise of religion.
With a focus at the intersections of equality, healthcare, and religious rights, her extensive scholarship probes the ambiguities and potential conflicts among these subjects. “I don’t think I fit in a box. I’m a bit of a chameleon,” says Sepper.

Finding Resilience in the Law
When many lawyers think about the first year of law school, they recall coffee-fueled discussions about the theories behind contract consideration and tort law remedies. Prof. Erik Encarnacion wants to change the way the profession thinks about these foundational concepts.
Encarnacion’s new research includes a series of articles on how resilience can shape traditional private law. His writing and speaking on resilience thus far have focused on tort law remedies, but this lawyer and philosopher hopes to open the door to questions about the bases for modern law. In “Resilience, Retribution, and Punitive Damages,” Encarnacion introduces the concept of “retributive resilience” in punitive damages.
The paper argues that rather than representing an unjustified “windfall,” awards of punitive damages paid to the plaintiff can in appropriate cases be “a crucial avenue by which victims may attain a constructive form of retributive justice that allows them to demonstrate, to themselves and others, their resilience.” This is a departure from the widely-held view that punitive damages are inherently opposed to tort law’s compensatory aims, and Encarnacion says he resists “knee-jerk hostility to punitive damages.”

Innovating the Curriculum
“It’s the best class I ever taught in my life.” That’s how Prof. A. Mechele Dickerson, describes “COVID and the Law,” the course she created in 2021 to discuss lessons in law and society learned from the pandemic. Because that pandemic was still ongoing as the course began, Dickerson realized that the best way to teach it was to bring in guest lecturers from around the entire university. In each weekly session, students heard from experts on medical issues, environmental justice, the rights of people who are in jails, prisons, and detention facilities, workplace health and safety laws, intellectual property law, and more.
The broad scope captured essential parts of Dickerson’s approach to both her scholarship and teaching: embrace interdisciplinary learning and find inspiration in real-world challenges.
“Texas, in terms of my scholarship and my teaching, is absolutely perfect, because we’re a very large research university, which means that I am given grace and flexibility to teach where my research is going,” says Dickerson, who has been recognized for both her teaching and her scholarship as an elected member of the American Law Institute and an inductee into the University of Texas Academy of Distinguished Teachers.

Title IX
The University and the Law School are committed to creating and fostering a campus environment free from all forms of sex discrimination. Title IX, as well as state law and university policy, protect all members of our campus community who experience sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, interpersonal violence (including dating and domestic violence), stalking, or discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.
The University’s Title IX Office, Office for Inclusion and Equity, and Department of Investigation and Adjudication are responsible for investigating all Title IX reports at UT Austin. The Law School does not have its own Title IX process. Any Title IX incident involving law students, faculty, or staff must be reported to and addressed by the University’s Title IX Office.
File a Title IX Report
Assistant Dean Elizabeth Bangs has received comprehensive Title IX training and is available to provide resources and support. Any student with questions or concerns about Title IX is welcome and encouraged to contact either Dean Bangs or the Title IX office.
Mandatory Reporters
All University employees (both faculty and staff) who are not designated as Confidential Resources are required to promptly report any knowledge of any incidents of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, or stalking “committed by or against a person who was a student enrolled at or an employee of the institution at the time of the incident.” Texas Education Code 51.252.  If you disclose a Title IX incident to a faculty or staff member, they are required to report the incident to the University’s Title IX Office. As a student, you always have the option to request a dismissal of the investigation or be a Reluctant Complainant in the investigation process, which means you don’t have to participate in the investigation.
Not ready to file a report?
If you have been subject to or have become aware of a possible Title IX violation, but you are not ready to file a report or pursue the grievance process, the University has designated a number of Confidential Resources. These are staff members who are not required to report Title IX incidents that are disclosed to them. They include the providers at the Counseling and Mental Health Center and trained, professional Advocates in the Student Emergency Services Office. When meeting with a confidential support person, you may share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. Confidential Resources are available to help by:
Offering a safe and private setting to discuss questions, concerns, and experiences;
Providing information about your rights and options regarding the Title IX reporting and investigation process;
Exploring academic, housing, medical, and or/ financial accommodations and remedies; and
Referring you to other on- and off-campus resources.
File a Title IX Report
If you have been subject to a possible Title IX violation — or are concerned about a possible violation you have witnessed or become aware of — and wish to initiate the grievance process, you may file a report directly with the Title IX Office or meet with Dean Bangs for assistance in filing a report.
Why report?
The incident has negatively affected your academics or employment.
You have concerns about your safety or the safety of the community.
You need someone to confide in or want to seek assistance and support, even if you are not seeking action or do not want to name the Respondent.
You want the University to pursue disciplinary action against the Respondent.
You want a No Contact Directive to be put in place between you and the Respondent.
Reporting an incident informs the University of the incident, which allows the institution to provide support, resources, and accommodations to all the parties impacted by the incident and does not necessarily result in the initiation of a grievance process.
What happens next?
If you choose to file a Formal Complaint (a request that the University initiate an investigation and possible disciplinary action), the Title IX Office will reach out to both parties to discuss next steps and provide information on specific resources and accommodations related to the Formal Complaint. The Title IX Office will then initiate the appropriate Grievance Process.
Confidentiality
All reports are treated with the greatest degree of confidentiality possible. Confidentiality is maintained on a need-to-know basis with respect to the University’s obligations to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct and take the appropriate corrective action.
Members of the University community will not be informed of the outcome of a Title IX investigation to which they are not a party.
Consensual Relationships Policy
The University’s Consensual Relationships Policy prohibits consensual relationships between:
employees (including faculty) or affiliates and any graduate student whom that individual teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way; and
student employees and any student whom that student employee teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates in any way.
Accommodations for Pregnancy, Nursing, and Parenting
Title IX also prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and parenting status. The University and Law School provide reasonable accommodations due to pregnancy and parenting needs. If you are seeking pregnancy and parenting-related accommodations, make an appointment with Assistant Dean Elizabeth Bangs. You may also contact the University’s Title IX Office.
JON 5.226 and 6.226 and TNH 3.107 are lactation rooms available for student use. (The JON rooms are available only during regular business hours.) Please contact the Student Affairs Office or the Human Resources Office for the door codes.

University HOP Policies
University Policies are designed to communicate institutional rules for operation, organization, and programming of the university, including policy relating to students.
Browse or Search University HOP policies
The University Policy Office (UPO) is an administrative unit with responsibility for the strategic design and implementation of the university policy management program. UPO coordinates policy lifecycle management with key policy owners and maintains the Handbook of Operating Procedures (HOP) policy library and website.
The HOP contains the university's governing policies. These policies connect the university's mission to the everyday actions of its community, clarify the university's expectations of its individual members, mitigate institutional risk, enhance efficiency, and support the university's compliance with laws and regulations. Policies found in the HOP direct the function of administrative operations or University activities, but do not include educational policies developed through faculty legislation.
The University of Texas at Austin has adopted ComplianceBridge as the primary policy management system for the university. The HOP policy library can be viewed at the UT Policy Library webpage.

Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority, the University prohibits any employee (including faculty) or affiliate of the University from engaging in a consensual relationship with any student currently enrolled as an undergraduate at the University.**Note: "Employee"; as used in Section VII.A.1 does not include student employees. See Section VII.A.4 below for prohibitions applicable to University student employees. Also, for purposes of this policy, the term "undergraduate" does not include any individual who is considered an undergraduate at the University solely because the individual is taking course(s) through the Staff Educational Benefit offered to University employees. Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority between graduate students and their educators, advisors, supervisors, and others holding positions of authority over them, the University prohibits any employee (including faculty) or affiliate of the University from engaging in a consensual relationship with any graduate student whom they teach, manage, supervise, advise, or evaluate in any way. Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority, the University prohibits consensual relationships between Intercollegiate Athletics coaches, employees, or affiliates, with any student-athlete or student assigned to or associated with Intercollegiate Athletics, such as interns and student employees.*Note: "Employee" as used in Section VII.A.3 does not include student employees except for those who teach, manage, supervise, advise, coach, or evaluate any student-athlete or student assigned to or associated with Intercollegiate Athletics. Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority, the University prohibits any student employee (including resident life advisors/assistants, assistant instructors, teaching assistants, graduate research assistants, etc.) from engaging in a consensual relationship with any student whom they teach, manage, supervise, advise, or evaluate in any way.  Reporting Requirements Considering the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism and the inherent differential in authority, the University prohibits consensual relationships between employees (including faculty) and/or affiliates where one teaches, manages, supervises, advises, or evaluates the other in any way unless the person in the position of greater authority or power notifies appropriate University offices (as detailed in Section VII.B.2.a of this policy) and a mitigation plan is put in place that mitigates the conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism. In the event a consensual relationship exists between employees (including faculty) and/or affiliates, the following steps must immediately be followed by the person in the position of greater authority or power:  report the consensual relationship to the appropriate dean and the EVPP (when the relationship involves a faculty member), and/or the appropriate unit head and HR (when the relationship involves a staff member and/or affiliate); report any relationship that currently exists prior to the effective date of this policy to the University offices specified above as soon as possible and cooperate in the development of a mitigation plan as outlined in Section VII.C, below; cooperate in the development of a mitigation plan designed to reduce or eliminate the conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism.   If a consensual relationship exists between employees of the University and one of those employees is presented with the opportunity to teach, manage, supervise, advise, or evaluate the other in any way, the existing relationship must be reported by the individual in the position of greater authority or power to the appropriate University offices designated above as soon as possible and prior to the individual accepting a role that would create a conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism, and a mitigation plan must be developed. Departments and offices that receive reports of consensual relationships as outlined in this policy will notify the applicable VP, Dean, or the EVPP, each of whom will, in turn, notify DIA of the relationship and provide DIA a copy of the mitigation plan for record keeping purposes.  Mitigation Plan If the conflict of interest and the potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism can be successfully mitigated and managed, a written mitigation plan will be produced within ten (10) business days of the report (unless there are reasonable grounds for additional time) by the appropriate chair, dean, and EVPP (when the relationship involves a faculty member) or the appropriate unit head, DIA, and HR (when the relationship involves a staff member and/or University affiliate) in collaboration with both parties to the consensual relationship. If the mitigation plan is not agreed to by all parties to the plan, resolution of the disagreement will be handled through consultation with the appropriate vice president of the individual(s) opposing the plan and DIA. In the case of a relationship involving individual(s) associated with Intercollegiate Athletics, the consultation will involve the Office of the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and DIA. If the conflict of interest and potential for exploitation or the appearance of exploitation or favoritism created by the consensual relationship cannot be successfully mitigated and managed, then the consensual relationship is prohibited. The mitigation plan will:  provide an alternative means for managing, supervising, teaching, evaluating and/or advising of the supervisee or otherwise mitigate the conflict; give priority to the interest of the supervisee; be in writing and signed by both parties to the consensual relationship; provide notice of HOP 3-3031 - Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex Discrimination; and be reassessed on an annual basis (or sooner if circumstances warrant) by the parties, and the applicable department/unit for necessary modification.   ExemptionsExemptions to any of these provisions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will be approved by the Associate Vice President for Investigation and Adjudication, with input from the supervisor(s) of the individual(s) involved.Questions about the application or effect of this policy to an existing or potential relationship should be directed to DIA, HR and/or the EVPP. This policy is not intended to apply to marriage relationships. Refer to HOP 5-1260 - Employment of Close Relatives (Nepotism), for information concerning these types of relationships.  Reporting Alleged ViolationsAn employee (including faculty) or affiliate who is notified, or becomes aware of, an alleged violation of this policy has an obligation to report it timely.  Report Here  Investigation and Discipline Alleged violations of this policy, including concerns of conflicts of interests, favoritism, and/or exploitation will be investigated by DIA in collaboration with the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs. If there is a complaint of sexual harassment/sexual misconduct relating to a relationship covered by this policy, and the relationship has not been disclosed and no Mitigation Plan is in place, the responsibility will be on the person in the position of greater authority or power to explain the failure to comply with this policy. Such failure will be a factor in determining whether the relationship was consensual and free of sexual harassment/misconduct. Disciplinary action against faculty and staff will be handled under the University's policies for discipline and dismissal of faculty and staff. Disciplinary actions may include, but are not limited to, written reprimands, the imposition of conditions, reassignment, suspension, and dismissal. Affiliates in violation of this policy may be disciplined as appropriate under the circumstances. Safe Harbor It is critical the University receive notification of consensual relationships covered by this policy so as to prevent conflicts of interest, favoritism, and exploitation. Unreported consensual relationships pose a significant risk to the University community. With this in mind, if the person in the consensual relationship who is in the position of greater authority or power immediately notifies appropriate University offices of the development of a consensual relationship covered by this policy and cooperates to mitigate the effects of the consensual relationship, then a conduct/discipline investigation may not be pursued. Unreported consensual relationships will be considered more severe violations of this policy.*Note: This safe harbor provision does not apply to potential violations of HOP 3-3031 - Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex Discrimination.  Retaliation ProhibitedRetaliation against a person who reports a potential violation under this policy, assists someone with a report of a violation, or participates in any manner in an investigation or in the resolution of a complaint made under this policy is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. Retaliation includes, but is not limited to threats, intimidation, reprisals and/or adverse actions related to an individual's employment or education. The University will take appropriate steps to assure a person who in good faith reports, complains about, or participates in an investigation pursuant to this policy will not be subjected to retaliation. Individuals who believe they are experiencing retaliation are strongly encouraged to lodge a complaint with DIA and/or UCS.  Counseling Confidential counseling services are available to employees through the Employee Assistance Program at 512-471-3366 and to students through the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center at 512-471-3515.  Forms & Tools The Department of Investigation and Adjudication (DIA) - File a Complaint with DIAUniversity Compliance Services (UCS) - Compliance and Ethics HotlineFor a mitigation plan template, contact DIA: dia@austin.utexas.edu  Frequently Asked QuestionsNone  Related Information University Affiliates HOP 3-3031 Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex DiscriminationFor Employees - Employee Assistance Program For Students - UT Counseling and Mental Health CenterUTS184 Consensual RelationshipsRegents' Rules and Regulations, Rule 30105: Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, and Consensual RelationshipsHOP 3-1022 Protection from Retaliation for Suspected Misconduct Reporting (Whistleblower)HOP 5-1260 Employment of Close Relatives (Nepotism)  HistoryOrigination date: November 1, 2001Modified: January 3, 2017     Editorial Revisions: August 2, 2022     Editorial Revisions: May 31, 2023Previously PM 4.110, HOP 4.A.2

Additional Information re- IT Use and Security
1. Overview
This document sets forth the Data Privacy Standards of the University of Texas at Austin (“University”) and provides information about the collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data provided to or otherwise collected or processed by the University.
2. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a generally applicable University-wide data privacy standard and to provide interested persons with information about the University’s collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data regardless of the lawful bases under or legitimate purpose for which the information was obtained.  Subject to state and federal law, the University intends for this policy to be compliant with the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
3. Scope
The Data Privacy Standard applies to all domains within the University Web and to any other University action or process concerning the collection, processing, analysis and other data processing of personal information regardless of the method by which such information came to be owned and/or controlled by the University.
The University, by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, “University Web”). While this policy applies across campus, some University websites may have additional policies and practices regarding privacy that also must be observed.  The University’s Data Protection Officer in consultation with the Chief Information Officer must approve any such “local” policies prior to the policy’s implementation.
The University’s Web may contain links to third party external websites over which the University has no control.  The University disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of external websites regardless of a link to such websites being displayed on the University Web.
For the purposes of the policy, “processing” means obtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data, including – organization, adaptation or alteration of the information or data, retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data, disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data.  A “data subject” is a phrase that refers to the person to whom the personal data relates.
4. Required Link
Each University Web application or site shall contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
5. What is ‘personal information’ or ‘personal data’?
‘Personal information’ or ‘personal data’ means any information that relates to or identifies a person as an individual.
6. How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?
The University obtains personal information when a person fills out and submits an application to attend or work at the University along with any additional information the person submits to the University before or after they submit an application.  Persons may also provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services.
In addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services, the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University.  As discussed elsewhere in this policy, some University Web (as well as third party’s) webpages use “cookies” to collect information about the web user.  University Web servers (“Web Server”) may also “collect” information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information:
Internet address (IP address) of computer being used
Web pages requested
Referring Web page
Browser used
Date and Time
UIN (unique person identifier for EID-based services only)
The data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.
Individual data gathered through a specific process, such as the submission of an application to attend the University, related submissions, and subsequent interaction with admissions staff, will only be used for its intended purpose, such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision, or for certain archiving, research, or statistical purposes described below.  Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University.
The University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes (“research purposes”).  Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible.  The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject.  The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes.
Further processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University.  Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University’s processes for human subject research, if applicable, and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects.
7. Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited. For example, when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time the person visited the site, a cookie was probably set on their computer; when they return, the cookie is read again. A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed.
University Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID. The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web. Normally, a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community. For example, students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.
Some Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.
8. Third-party content on UT Websites
Some pages within the utexas.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a utexas.edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party. Specifically, the following code within a utexas.edu page would represent an example of third party content:
<img src="/%3Ca%20href%3D"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" />
In this example, logo.gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas.edu domain (www.other-org.com in this case). Third party content in utexas.edu is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.
The University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when a person visits utexas.edu pages that contain third party content, information, such as their IP address, date, browser, and requested page, is transmitted from your computer to that third party.
9. Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University
The University processes personal data for a number of reasons, including to meet its contractual obligations, the legitimate conduct of its business operations, and to comply with applicable law.  Sometimes, consent will be the basis for processing personal data.  In these cases, the University will ask the data subject for consent to process their personal data and to share that data with third parties. The processing of personal data provided to the University by a data subject or from authorized third parties, like their high school or a national testing service, enables the University to identify the data subject; engage in processing an application or other submission to the University; or verify information already provided to the University.
The University may also use or disclose personal data for the following statutory or public interest purposes:  to prevent or detect fraud; to monitor equal opportunity; to better serve the needs of students with disabilities with reasonable accommodations; or for research and statistical purposes, the later purpose relying only on aggregate data.
Furthermore, the University processes personal data either necessary for the University to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with a person (e.g. to assess an offer of services to the University) or for the purposes of a legitimate interest of the University pursued by the University (e.g. equal opportunity monitoring).  The University requires persons to provide the University with certain information during the application process in order to assess their application properly except where providing personal information is marked as optional.  Neither admissions nor employment decisions are automated.
10. Google Analytics
Some University Web websites use Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the user visits the site. This information is used to monitor the effectiveness of the website and to consider potential improvements to the website. The information is non-personal and is transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. The University does not share any specific information about a particular user.
Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics terms of use and Google's privacy practices. To opt out of Google’s data collection, read more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
11. Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information
The University does its best to ensure that the personal information it has is accurate. Users with a UT EID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address at UT Direct.
Although no computer system is 100% secure, the University has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.  See Information Resources Use and Security Policy https://security.utexas.edu/policies/irusp#standard12
12. Plan to Respond to Data Breaches
The University has policies and procedures in place in case of a data breach or some other incident that places information held by the University in jeopardy.  Any individual who believes a data breach has occurred must immediately notify the Chief Information Security Officer, who will investigate the alleged breach and, if necessary, consult with the University’s Data Breach Response Planning Group and the affected department to remediate the breach, including providing any required notices.
Please see the two policies below for the University’s full data breach policies (UT EID Required).
ISO Incident Management Procedures
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/incident-management-procedures
Personally Identifiable Data Breach Notification Plan
https://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/data-breach-notification-plan
In certain circumstances, the University may be required to provide notice to affected individuals or certain governing authorities if a data breach results in disclosure of personal data.
13. E-commerce
Several sites within the University Web enable users to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy to only use confidential information that a user enters during a transaction for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.
14. Open Records Requests and Other Sharing of Information
Except for educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or information made confidential by other law, all information provided to and collected from the University Web, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the University Web, and information collected from University Web-based forms, along with any other form or type of document or other instrument containing personal information, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.  Such information may also, in the legal context, be subject to discovery requests or other legal demand that personal data or information be released and made public.  The same is true for any personal information obtained by the University through other means such as written submission or communications with previous schools or employers.
The University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users.
As well as circulating application and related materials to the appropriate staff at the University and its various departments and colleges, the University will share personal information for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:
School/college or training organizations;
Examination boards or testing services;
In the case of international applicants, the appropriate state and federal agencies;
Immigration authorities in order to act as a person’s sponsor for visa purposes;
Governmental bodies, including local authorities; the Teachers’ Retirement System; UT Workers Compensation; and other agencies or private actors, such as health care providers, that circumstances require be privy to certain personal information
Other Higher Education organizations, in order to assist with tracking and research into access to Higher Education; and
Companies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, the University and/or one or more of its component colleges, schools, department or programs.
Unless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act or otherwise compelled by lawful means, or as a party to a legal action, it is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the University Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences. For example, the University's portal, UT Direct, enables users to customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot be shared with external third parties, unless required by law.
Consistent with FERPA and other applicable privacy law, the University does not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless the University receives explicit written consent, is required to do so by law, or for other legitimate ends of the University.  University students can read more about directory information in the University's General Information Catalog. Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.
15. Public Forums
The University makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that users disclose in these areas becomes public information, so users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.
Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Canvas, may be logged. However, FERPA generally prohibits disclosure of these educational records.
16. Online Surveys
The University is a research institution. At any time, the University is conducting numerous online surveys on the University Web. It is University policy only to use personal information gathered in these online surveys for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas Public Information Act or as otherwise compelled by law. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
17. Who will process my personal information?
The University will internally share the personal information it receives from applications and other information submitted to the University in accordance with the University’s policy and practice.  Various university staff and faculty may be involved in processing personal data for the purposes for which the University obtained the data.  In some instances, a third-party vendor employed by the University to assist in data processing might process personal data.  Data subjects have the right to be notified of such third party processing of their personal information.
18.  What personal information will be processed?
For students, the University will use the details provided on their application, together with any supporting documents or other forms of information that an applicant may provide with their application.  For the purposes of this policy the “application” includes the online application, application fee, an essay, three short answer prompts, your high school transcripts, any college transcripts, test scores, major-specific items, resume, letters of recommendation (not required) and, if applicable, permanent residence card, student information form, course work form and residency affidavit. Different application forms may apply depending on citizen/residency status.
In addition to the application form, the University will use the details in a transcript from every senior college the applicant has attended.  Where the applicant seeks entry into the graduate Accounting and Nursing programs, University will make use of information from an applicants’ transcripts from all junior and/or community colleges attended as well as past test scores.  The individual graduate programs have additional requirements that may require the University to use additional materials.  The same applies to any letters of recommendation that are received.  The University may also rely on personal information that arises from student conduct investigations or hearings.
For faculty and staff, the University will process personal information received in an application for employment or through an interview as well as other means, formal and informal, and maintain records of employees.  For example, a faculty member may wish to participate in certain health care/insurance programs offered by third party vendors, who have a contract with the University to provide such things.  Enrollment in these programs may require sensitive date to be shared with the relevant third party, such as an insurance carrier.  The University will also make use of testing or evaluations to assess various aspects of faculty and staff performance.  Such information could arise as part of a grievance or disciplinary process.
19. What rights do I have related to my personal information?
Data subjects have the right to access the personal information that the University holds about them. Data subjects also have the right to ask the University to correct any inaccurate personal information the University holds about them.  In some cases, data subjects may request that the University delete personal information, request that the University restrict processing their personal information, or object to the University processing their personal information.
There are several laws, including FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) that give data subjects certain rights so far as it pertains to their personal information.
FERPA
FERPA provides the right to correct one’s personal data and have access to personal information kept about them.  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
Also, as a general rule but subject to certain exceptions, schools must have written permission from the parent or adult student in order to release any part of the student’s education records.
HIPAA
HIPAA provides certain personal data rights to patients who receive healthcare services at covered entities.  The University is a hybrid entity, which means that certain departments at the University, including, but not limited to, University Health Services (“UHS”) and Dell Medical School, are subject to HIPAA.  Each University department that is subject to HIPAA will provide a Notice of Privacy Practices to patients detailing their rights under HIPAA, including their personal data rights.  For example, a data subject may find the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by UHS at the following link: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/privacypractices.pdf.
Texas Public Information Act
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives a person the right to be informed about the information that the University collects about them. It also gives a person the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the University correct any of that information that is wrong. Requests to receive and review any of that information, or request corrections to it, may be made by contacting the University's Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box 8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (email: cfo@www.utexas.edu).
GDPR
The GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect May 25, 2018.  The GDPR’s intent is to regulate the gathering, use and maintenance of personally identifiable information about a natural person and providing certain rights to the data subject, such as the right to erasure and the right to object to the use of personal data.  This law applies to any person, citizen or not, who at the time of the data collection is located in the European Union.  It does not require an entity, like the University, to be located or acting within the EU for jurisdiction to attach; however, a non-EU entity like the University must process personal data related to the offering of goods or services in the EU or to the monitoring of a person’s behavior in the EU for jurisdiction to attach.
You have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information in accordance with all applicable laws. The erasure of your information will be subject to the retention periods of applicable federal and state law and the University’s Record Retention Schedule. If you have provided consent to the use of your information, you have the right to withdraw consent without affecting the lawfulness of the University's use of the information prior to receipt of your request.  A Data Subject may exercise their rights by contacting the University’s Data Protection Officer.
If you feel the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such information, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in the European Union.
The State of Texas and the United States also have laws that address privacy generally and the use of certain types of records, such as educational and health records (described above), that contain personally identifiable information.  Texas has laws that govern records retention and finally, under US/Texas law, the University may have good reason to keep the information despite a conflict with the GDPR.
As a general rule, in cases where Texas or Federal law conflict with the laws of other countries in regard to the processing, use or maintenance of a data subject’s personal information, including provisions of the GDPR, the University will treat Texas and Federal law as controlling.
University employees who receive a request by a Data Subject to have their data forgotten or who have other questions regarding the rights of Data Subjects provided by the GDPR should contact the University’s Data Protection Officer.
20. How long is my information kept?
The University is an agency of the state of Texas and must follow a records retention schedule, which may be found at: https://financials.utexas.edu/hbp/part-20/2-1-records-management-services-documents.  Generally, the University will keep records of applicants for admission or employment for the following periods of time:
Applicants for admission who do not matriculate into the University: one year after the semester during which an individual applies for admission to the University;
Applicants for admission who matriculate into the University: five years after graduation or the last day of attendance;
Applicants for employment who are not hired: two years from the end of the fiscal year during which the individual applies for employment; and
Applicants for employment who are hired: five years after the end of employment.
Some departments may be subject to other laws that require the department to keep certain personal information for a prescribed period.
Please see the records retention schedule for more information.  The University may update the records retention schedule from time to time.
21. Who can I contact for assistance or to complain?
Students with questions about how their personal information is used, or who wish to exercise any of their rights, may consult this policy and contact the Dean of Students, an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/,  or the office that oversees their primary area of study (major).  They may also contact the Registrar’s office.  https://registrar.utexas.edu/
Faculty may seek assistance from the chair of their department, the Dean of their college or equivalent position, a representative on the Faculty Council or the Provosts’ office or an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.
