This complements and is consistent with a previously released record summarizing cases from 2013 through most of 2017. Conduct violations are a matter of public record, and when asked, the university has regularly released this information.\nStatement\nSexual misconduct violates the values and policies of UT Austin. Every individual who serves our university must feel valued, respected and free to learn and work in a safe environment.\nUT Austin takes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and investigates them expeditiously. Recently, students have pressed the university to reexamine its approaches.\nDuring the past four months, consultants from the Husch Blackwell firm met with close to 1,500 stakeholders, including UT Austin students, staff and faculty members and led a comprehensive review of the university\xe2\x80\x99s sexual misconduct policies. On March 2, 2020, President Fenves sent a letter to the campus community accepting all of the Husch Blackwell recommendations.\xc2\xa0 The university will now begin the implementation of these recommendations.\nRelated Policies\nUT Austin Policies Relevant to Title IX\nUT Austin Experts\nTo speak with the university\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX coordinator, please contact\xc2\xa0Eliska Padilla\xc2\xa0in UT Austin\xe2\x80\x99s media relations office or contact the media relations office front desk at 512-471-3151.\nResources\nTitle IX Website\nTitle IX: File A Report\nTitle IX: Impact Reports\nSexual Misconduct Working Group\nMessages to Campus\nChanging Sexual Misconduct Policies at UT Austin \xe2\x80\x93 President Gregory L.

The first phase of the review is now complete. Husch Blackwell has presented me with\xc2\xa0recommended policy changes\xc2\xa0that are designed to better support survivors, provide clear disciplinary guidelines and improve communication with the campus community.\nI have accepted all of these recommendations. We are now beginning the implementation of the recommendations, and you will have opportunities to provide input as part of UT\xe2\x80\x99s procedure for instituting new policies.\nWhen new policies are in place, there will be three major changes:\nUT will streamline the resources we offer to survivors to support them effectively.\nIf any UT faculty or staff member is found \xe2\x80\x94 after a thorough investigation \xe2\x80\x94 to have committed sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence, the presumptive punishment will be termination. These are the four categories of misconduct included in Texas Senate Bill 212 that require reporting of violations at universities.\nIf there is a case in which a UT employee is found to have engaged in one of these four types of misconduct and is not terminated because of mitigating factors, that information will be compiled and made publicly available, while preserving the privacy of the survivors.\nAs we have evaluated our policies in recent months, we have also heard from the campus community about the importance of helping survivors to heal and offering alternative resolutions where appropriate. To accomplish this, we will consult with experts, including those in the Steve Hicks School of Social Work, to introduce restorative justice as an alternative approach.\nSexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and interpersonal violence will not be accepted at The University of Texas at Austin. If a faculty or staff member commits these acts, the consequences will be clear. I thank the Misconduct Working Group for their work in recent months, and I am grateful to the students and survivors who participated in our productive forum in January.\nSincerely,\nGregory L.

For several months, the firm\xe2\x80\x99s consultants have been holding meetings with students and other campus stakeholders to examine ways the university could improve its handling of faculty sexual misconduct.In a letter to the campus Monday, UT President Gregory L. Fenves outlined the policy changes, which include making termination a presumptive punishment for any faculty member found to have committed sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence.For those faculty who are not terminated after such a violation, their names will be compiled and made publicly available, while preserving the privacy of survivors, Fenves said.\xe2\x80\x9cSexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and interpersonal violence will not be accepted at The University of Texas at Austin,\xe2\x80\x9d Fenves wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a faculty or staff member commits these acts, the consequences will be clear.\xe2\x80\x9dThe impetus for the changes was an outcry from students, who in October began publicly protesting the continued employment of several faculty who had violated the school\xe2\x80\x99s sexual misconduct policies. Since then, the university has been working with students and experts to improve its processes and be more transparent.The university and Husch Blackwell consultants debated whether to regularly make a list of punished professors publicly available, out of concerns for survivors. At a meeting with the UT Faculty Council last month, consultant Scott Schneider said no other school across the country releases such a list.But ultimately, the reporting requirements outlined in Senate Bill 212 and Texas\xe2\x80\x99 public information policies warrant a \xe2\x80\x9cunique approach,\xe2\x80\x9d to these records, Husch Blackwell wrote in its recommendation.\xe2\x80\x9cIt is worth noting that this practice is not utilized by any of the peer institutions benchmarked for this review,\xe2\x80\x9d the report stated. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, we believe there are unique legal issues in Texas, including the mandatory reporting law and Texas\xe2\x80\x99s robust public information law, that warrant a unique approach.\xe2\x80\x9dOther recommendations from Husch Blackwell include streamlining survivor services, making sexual misconduct training mandatory for employees, and implementing restorative justice methods in sex discrimination matters.Consultants found that while the university offered a robust set of support services for survivors, the system was viewed as confusing, not clearly communicated and possibly underutilized. The firm recommended UT make a single office where students can access confidential personnel to provide them support.The firm also recommended UT clearly differentiate between forms of sexual misconduct in its policies, which it said causes confusion about the seriousness of different violations. It recommended the university define each act of misconduct with as much precision as possible.\xe2\x80\x9cWe recommend that the University clarify that not all violations of its sex discrimination policy are equally egregious \xe2\x80\x94 a point that should be emphasized in the definitions themselves as well as the presumptively appropriate sanctions the University metes out for violations of the policy,\xe2\x80\x9d the report said.Tasnim Islam, a UT sophomore and one of the leaders of the student-led Coalition Against Sexual Misconduct, said she was ecstatic to read about the recommendations, which are almost identical to the demands made by students last fall. Still, Islam said she and other students are concerned about student involvement going forward.\xe2\x80\x9cThis issue shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t continue to go on behind closed doors with just experts and administrators,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cStudents need to actively be in the room.\xe2\x80\x9dCareers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell / Share / Target My InfoCookie SettingsContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Austin American-Statesman Store Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\xc2\xa9 2023 www.statesman.com.

He said Monday he accepted all the suggestions \xe2\x80\x94 which are \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to better support survivors, provide clear disciplinary guidelines and improve communication with the campus community\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and that UT would begin implementing them. The announcement comes months after students began protesting that professors punished by UT for sexual misconduct were still teaching undergraduates, and weeks after students condemned the school\'s handling of sexual misconduct cases at an emotional forum in late January.\nProviding information about professors found responsible for misconduct was one of the student protesters\xe2\x80\x99 top demands.\nFenves said Monday that if a university employee engaged in the four categories of misconduct but was not terminated because of \xe2\x80\x9cmitigating factors,\xe2\x80\x9d information about the case would be \xe2\x80\x9ccompiled and made publicly available, while preserving the privacy of the survivors.\xe2\x80\x9d He said a \xe2\x80\x9cthorough investigation\xe2\x80\x9d would precede each finding of misconduct.\nFenves also said experts in the Steve Hicks School of Social Work would be consulted about introducing alternative resolution options and restorative justice for sexual misconduct-related matters.\nThe university fast-tracked the production of the recommendations after the January forum, in which students tearfully recounted being subjected to sexual misconduct or going through the university\xe2\x80\x99s investigative process. Others said administrators had failed the student body and accused administrators of protecting professors with histories of misconduct.\n\"Why would you be hiding the fact that we\'re in rooms with sexual predators every time we go to class?\" one woman asked at the forum.\nFenves said shortly after the event that the school would hire two additional investigators to help look into misconduct complaints more quickly.\nSince the protests began last fall, UT has formed a working group on the subject with students, faculty and administrators. It also hired the external firm, Husch Blackwell, whose lawyers participated in the working group and held several \xe2\x80\x9clistening sessions\xe2\x80\x9d with various parties on campus.\nThe lawyers\' suggestions include consolidating and expanding confidential resources for students, and adding timelines to encourage quicker resolution of sex discrimination complaints.\nUT has released lists of employees found to have violated sexual misconduct-related policies before, but only in response to public information requests. Under pressure from students, the university disclosed in January that 17 employees were found to have violated its sexual misconduct-related policies between November 2017 and December 2019. Three faculty members were on the list. The external firm said in its recommendations that proactively publishing the names of policy violators was \"not utilized by any of the peer institutions benchmarked for this review; however, we believe there are unique legal issues in Texas, including the mandatory reporting law and Texas\xe2\x80\x99s robust public information law, that warrant a unique approach.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe university has previously used a range of sanctions to penalize professors found responsible for sexual misconduct, with the severity of the punishment corresponding with the offense.\nTexas A&M University overhauled its sexual misconduct-related policies in 2018 after a review from the same external firm, Husch Blackwell. The school now requires that any employee found responsible for sexual harassment be automatically fired.\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

University of Texas at Austin President Greg Fenves said if employees are found to have engaged in such misconduct but are not terminated because of mitigating factors, the university will make that information publicly available.(File 2012 - The Associated Press)By Mar\xc3\xada  M\xc3\xa9ndez12:54 PM on Mar 2, 2020 CST \xe2\x80\x94 Updated at 4:56 PM on Mar 2, 2020 CSTLISTENRevised throughout at 5 p.m. on March 2 to include additional details.AUSTIN \xe2\x80\x94 Following an external review of its sexual misconduct policies, the University of Texas at Austin says that in the future it will fire employees found to have committed sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence.AdvertisementUT President Greg Fenves on Monday announced the policy changes, along with a report of recommendations from legal firm Husch Blackwell, in an email to the UT community.AdvertisementThey are based on the input of a university working group formed in response to multiple student protests last fall over faculty members who were allowed to return to teaching after being disciplined for sexual misconduct.Political PointsGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.Email AddressBy signing up you agree to our\xc2\xa0Terms of Service\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Privacy PolicySUBMIT\xe2\x80\x9cSexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and interpersonal violence will not be accepted at the University of Texas at Austin,\xe2\x80\x9d Fenves wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a faculty or staff member commits these acts, the consequences will be clear.\xe2\x80\x9dLast fall, students called for the firing of professors with histories of misconduct. Fenves told students at a January town hall that in the past the university made the determination on whether to terminate employment on how much of a safety threat a faculty member presented \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the facts of the case.\xe2\x80\x9dAdvertisementNow, the university will amend its policies to make employee termination the presumptive punishment for those forms of misconduct, Fenves wrote in his email.But the policy change will only affect employees going forward, said Scott Schneider, a partner at Husch Blackwell and a higher education law expert. Making the policy retroactive could open up a flood of past cases and harm survivors who may not want to revisit their cases, Schneider said on Monday.\xe2\x80\x9cFirst off, there are complicated legal reasons why I can't retroactively subject someone to a standard that wasn't in place at the time of misconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm just not convinced from my vantage point that that would serve anyone well.\xe2\x80\x9dAdvertisementHusch Blackwell also recommended UT revise its policies to define those forms of misconduct as clearly as possible to address differences between state and federal definitions of harassment and sexual assault to avoid confusion about the severity of incidents.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cWe recommend that the university clarify that not all violations of its sex discrimination policy are equally egregious,\xe2\x80\x9d the firm\xe2\x80\x99s report says.If employees are found to have engaged in sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence but are not fired because of mitigating factors, the university will make information about the employees\xe2\x80\x99 misconduct publicly available, while protecting the privacy of survivors. This transparency will not apply to lower-level offenses, Schneider said.Previously, UT only released summaries of employee misconduct through public information requests. But, after some students unknowingly signed up for classes with professors disciplined for sexual misconduct, student protesters demanded the university make the information widely available.AdvertisementThe unprecedented transparency under the new policy will be possible because of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 public information laws and new reporting requirements under a bill passed by the Texas Legislature last year, Schneider said. Senate Bill 212 instituted mandatory reporting of sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and dating violence for Texas universities and their employees.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s those two unique aspects that called for what I think is a unique recommendation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.UT will also streamline the resources offered to survivors and introduce a restorative justice program as an alternative approach to resolve incidents. Restorative justice, which focuses on the rehabilitation of offenders through reconciliation with victims and the community, could be utilized when both the complainant and the accused agree to the approach, Schneider said.The firm developed the recommendations, which were submitted to Fenves on Friday, by interviewing roughly 1,500 university members since it was hired in November, Schneider said. In his email, Fenves said he had \xe2\x80\x9caccepted all of these recommendations,\xe2\x80\x9d which include mandatory employee training on sex discrimination and more prompt resolutions to misconduct cases.AdvertisementSchneider said the firm hopes to finalize policy recommendations by the end of the spring semester.Tasnim Islam, a student organizer in the university\xe2\x80\x99s working group, said she was \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmed with joy\xe2\x80\x9d when she saw the policy changes, but she was upset it took the input of a law firm for the university to listen to students\xe2\x80\x99 demands. She said she hopes UT will continue listening to students as the changes are implemented.\xe2\x80\x9cWe, as student activists, are going to constantly be improving upon our student demands and holding the university accountable in implementing these changes in a timely manner,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a statement.Alyssa Ashcraft, another student organizer, said she wished the recommendations had included adding a question about how safe students feel around professors to the anonymous surveys students take on instructors after each course.

These include a termination policy for UT faculty or employees who are found to have committed certain forms of sex discrimination deemed \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable behaviors,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a campuswide email from President Gregory Fenves.\nThe changes come as a result of a review of UT\xe2\x80\x99s sexual misconduct policies by law firm Husch Blackwell. The firm\xe2\x80\x99s first report was released to the public Monday. Fenves said in the email that the University has accepted all of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations. He said UT would implement three major changes based on the recommendations: the consolidation of survivor resources, the termination of certain policy violators and the release of the names of employees who violate certain policies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf any UT faculty or staff member is found \xe2\x80\x94 after a thorough investigation \xe2\x80\x94 to have committed sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking or interpersonal violence, the presumptive punishment will be termination,\xe2\x80\x9d Fenves said in the email.\nThe recommendations only apply to future policy and do not allow the University to retroactively terminate previous policy violators, such as English associate professor Coleman Hutchison and Sahotra Sarkar, integrative biology and philosophy professor, Husch Blackwell attorney Scott Schneider said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe default is going to be separation from the institution, as opposed to now where there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a default,\xe2\x80\x9d Schneider said.\nThe report recommends the consideration of unique circumstances in cases where termination may not be necessary. Another recommendation is that the University release the names of employees who violate sexual misconduct policies but are still employed.\nWant more content like this in your inbox every morning?\nHusch Blackwell was hired in November to review the University\xe2\x80\x99s sexual misconduct policies, according to the contract between the law firm and the University. Three lawyers from the firm held stakeholder meetings on campus and worked with the Misconduct Working Group to form their initial recommendations.\nThe report also recommends the University clearly define sexual misconduct, require sex discrimination training, implement stricter Title IX investigation timelines and consolidate sex discrimination resources into one office. Currently, the University has three offices that deal with sex discrimination cases.\nSchneider said there are many resources for survivors on campus, but they were scattered and not well-advertised.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a marketing problem here,\xe2\x80\x9d Schneider said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are tons of resources, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that students know about the existing resources. My concern is because of that, they go underutilized.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnother recommendation the University will implement is working with restorative justice experts, such as those in the Steve Hicks School of Social Work, to offer additional solutions to survivors, Fenves said in the email. Restorative justice programs focus on bringing together offenders and victims to allow for healing and understanding between both parties.\nOne of the demands of the Coalition Against Sexual Misconduct was the implementation of a restorative justice program.\nSchneider said they included this recommendation to create more informal resolution options and help the community affected by a Title IX case.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we have one of these cases, not only is the claimant and the respondent impacted, but a whole department can be impacted,\xe2\x80\x9d Schneider said. \xe2\x80\x9cUsing restorative justice principles and vehicles (can) fix harm that the community has experienced.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAccording to the report, Husch Blackwell will continue to make other recommendations related to the organization of Title IX compliance offices, the investigation process when upcoming federal regulations are released, the effects of sexual misconduct on third parties and how the University can ensure sanctions remain consistent.\n0\nMore to Discover\nMore in News\nUT professor recognized for contributions to cellular and molecular bioengineering\nStudents grieve loss in Israel and Palestine through on campus vigils\nBusiness owners express concern over I-35 expansion project\nCity of Austin relies on community feedback to redesign parts of Shoal Creek\nProposed school voucher program causes concern for future of public education in Texas\nFormer UT Professor inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame\nMore in Uncategorized\nMartin Scorsese\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Killers of the Flower Moon\xe2\x80\x99 depicts a disturbing picture of evil acting in plain sight, using the Osage tribe\xe2\x80\x99s story\nEarly observations from Texas men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball\xe2\x80\x99s Orange-White Scrimmage\nA Texas-sized performance with Alpha Phi Omega\nLiveshot: Timeless Bonnie Raitt gives Austin \xe2\x80\x9cSomething to Talk About\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Texan\xe2\x80\x99s guide to Austin\xe2\x80\x99s French Toast\n\xe2\x80\x9cFionna and Cake\xe2\x80\x9d hop through the multiverse in a fantastic new adventure\nMore in University\nUT collaborates with hydrogen energy hub\nTexas Orange Jackets recognize professors with Tenet Awards\nStudent opinions conflicted following Hartzell\xe2\x80\x99s statements on the Israel-Hamas war\nBenefits felt by Longhorns, Sooners following annual food fight to lessen campus food insecurity\nUT professor receives UT System Regents\xe2\x80\x99 award for exceptional teaching\nUT Disability Cultural Center to open disability-focused library for students\nThe Daily Texan\nOfficial newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin\nAdvertise\nNewsletters\nContact\nTexas Student Media\nFacebook\nInstagram\nYouTube\nRSS Feed\n\xc2\xa9 2023 All images and content \xc2\xa9 FLEX Pro WordPress Theme by SNO \xe2\x80\xa2 Log in\nSearch\nSubmit Search\nMenuClose MenuActivate SearchScroll to TopHomeUT-Austin to change sexual misconduct policy to terminate, release names of violators\nSearch\nNews\nSports\nLife & Arts\nMultimedia\nOpinion\nTexan en Espa\xc3\xb1ol\nFlipbooks\nLonghorns Remembered\nClassifieds\nSupport Us\nJoin\nAdvertise\nCloseClose Modal Window'"];

In addition to one professor who had already been publicly identified, the list included two more faculty members, one research fellow and 13 staff members.AdvertisementSeven employees, including three professors, were found to have made inappropriate sexual comments, another four made inappropriate contact and comments. Three employees were found to have engaged in inappropriate contact. One employee stalked a coworker, and one failed to disclose a consensual relationship between her and a subordinate.Political PointsGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.Email AddressBy signing up you agree to our\xc2\xa0Terms of Service\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Privacy PolicySUBMITOne of the professors, Coleman Hutchison, engaged in a consensual relationship with a student, which the university now bars. Hutchison and the other professors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They are all slated to teach during the upcoming semester, according to the university\xe2\x80\x99s course schedule.Ten employees were fired or resigned, according to the summary. The rest received warnings or were given various corrective measures detailed in the summary.AdvertisementPeter Lake, a law professor at Stetson University in Florida and an expert on misconduct in higher education, said the number of incidents was not surprising for a large university, especially in the wake of the broad #MeToo movement against misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have a large university, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a lot more HR problems,\xe2\x80\x9d Lake said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me that the number is in that range.\xe2\x80\x9dUT has about 3,000 teaching faculty members and 24,000 staff members, including student and seasonal employees, according to spokesman J.B. Bird.AdvertisementBut Merrick Rossein, a professor at the CUNY School of Law in New York, said he thinks 17 violations in the last two years is a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial number.\xe2\x80\x9dAdvertisement\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does surprise me is that many universities do not investigate thoroughly and quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, unlike UT in recent years.The summary was released as a university working group reviews sexual misconduct and disclosure policies in response to student concerns. Students held several sit-ins and protests last fall after learning that two professors, Sahotra Sarkar and Hutchison, returned to teaching after being disciplined for sexual misconduct.Students told The Dallas Morning News they signed up for these professors\xe2\x80\x99 courses without knowing their history and have demanded more transparency from UT.AdvertisementThe university has historically disclosed this information through open records requests. It previously released a similar summary listing violations from 2013 to November 2017. That list revealed 11 employee violations, including an investigation into complaints in 2016 that Sarkar made inappropriate comments to students about posing and swimming nude.\xe2\x80\x9cSexual misconduct violates the values and policies of UT Austin,\xe2\x80\x9d Bird said in a prepared statement. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery individual who serves our university must feel valued, respected and free to learn and work in a safe environment. Transparency around past violations, which is mandated by the Texas Public Information Act, is an important step toward accountability.\xe2\x80\x9dThe working group made up of students, faculty, employees, university leaders and outside experts began reviewing last month whether to proactively share this information with the public.Tasnim Islam, a sophomore on the working group and student protest organizer, said she was surprised the university released the information. She said leaders expressed hesitance after a separate group of students protested at a professor\xe2\x80\x99s house over his writings on sexual relations between men and boys.AdvertisementIslam said that the incidents in the summary, most of which describe complaints of employees making inappropriate sexual comments, give her trepidation about returning to classes this month, but that she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelieved\xe2\x80\x9d to have the information.\xe2\x80\x9cNow I know what parts of campus I feel safer in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.The university is hosting a Jan. 27 town hall with students about the misconduct violations. Islam said she still wants UT to make the information available without people having to file open records requests.\xe2\x80\x9cI definitely think that this is a step in the right direction, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the university to think that this is going to stop organizers\xe2\x80\x99 efforts,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.AdvertisementRead the report here:Mar\xc3\xada  M\xc3\xa9ndez, Politics Reporting Fellow.

Bird said UT is working to compile a summary of violations as far back as November 2017. It will be released to individuals who have submitted open records requests within this calendar year, but a university working group will be reviewing whether to publicly release the information.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cThis year with the protests there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of interest in this information,\xe2\x80\x9d Bird said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether the university should publish the information instead of just releasing it, that\xe2\x80\x99s a question that students have asked and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to review.\xe2\x80\x9dPolitical PointsGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.Email AddressBy signing up you agree to our\xc2\xa0Terms of Service\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Privacy PolicySUBMITStudents have held several sit-ins and protests after learning that two professors, Sahotra Sarkar and Coleman Hutchison, returned to teaching after being disciplined for sexual misconduct.Students told The Dallas Morning News they signed up for the professors\xe2\x80\x99 courses without knowing about their history.AdvertisementThat\xe2\x80\x99s why sophomore Tasnim Islam, one of the student members of the working group, and other student protesters say the university needs to make this information more widely available, perhaps through email or on the course schedule when they register for classes.\xe2\x80\x9cIf the university cares about their students\xe2\x80\x99 academics, they would make the course selection process much easier on us by equipping us with the information we need and want to know about our own future professors,\xe2\x80\x9d Islam said, citing the cost of public records requests.Bird said requesting investigation documents or wording requests too broadly can result in costs to the university to compile the information or redact details that would violate students\xe2\x80\x99 privacy rights. He said the summary of faculty and staff with violations will be provided for free. It will not include individuals who have been accused but have not been disciplined.AdvertisementPeople can also request summaries of violations for years before 2017, Bird said.AdvertisementUT hired the external firm Husch Blackwell in November and created a university working group to review its sexual misconduct policies, including how to disclose information, in response to student concerns.The contract with Husch Blackwell runs from Nov. 1 to Aug. 31, 2021, according to records obtained by The Dallas Morning News. It states that fees from the firm may not exceed $250,000.The university announced Friday that the working group includes six undergraduate students, three graduate students, one post-doctoral student, five faculty members, one staff member, six university leaders and two representatives from Husch Blackwell. Recommendations from the group are expected in April.AdvertisementAlso Friday, students who have formed the Coalition Against Sexual Misconduct protested at the steps of the university\xe2\x80\x99s main building, holding a red banner with the words \xe2\x80\x9cUT protects abusers.\"Kaya Epstein, a first-year student, said a lot of students aren\xe2\x80\x99t aware they can request records about faculty and staff misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9cThe information should be given to students,\" she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe deserve that information.

He was suspended from teaching, placed on half-time leave without pay and restricted from advising students in the spring, but he returned to teaching in fall 2017.Hutchison, an English associate professor, was disciplined in 2018 after making sexual comments to students and failing to disclose a consensual relationship with a graduate student. He was barred from supervising graduate students by himself, from consideration for promotion to full professor and from appointment to any administrative or leadership positions for two years.

Two days ago, UT President Greg Fenves and Executive Vice President and Provost Maurie McInnis agreed to attend a public forum with students next semester, and administrators have met with student organizers several times since the sit-ins began.\nTwo names in UT\xe2\x80\x99s spring 2020 course catalog spurred the student protests: Associate Professor Coleman Hutchison and Professor Sahotra Sarkar, whose sexual misconduct cases were reported in the media, are scheduled to teach undergraduate courses in January.\nSarkar was suspended for a semester in 2017 after students complained he asked them to pose for nude photos and swim with him at a nude beach and led uncomfortable conversations that were \xe2\x80\x9csexual in nature,\xe2\x80\x9d according to UT documents.\nHutchison made \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate remarks\xe2\x80\x9d to graduate students and entered into a consensual relationship with one, according to media reports and a summary of a UT investigation. He was banned from supervising graduate students on his own for two years, and his undergraduate courses were later canceled for one semester. Hutchison returned to the classroom this fall; Sarkar returned in the fall of 2017.\nNeither Hutchison nor Sarkar responded to requests for comment. Sarkar has disputed the allegations against him in UT documents, and said he complied when an administrator suggested changes in his conduct.\nBut UT students said it was an unpleasant surprise to learn of the professors\xe2\x80\x99 misconduct history from friends or through social media.\nAmanda Brown, a third-year student who took one of Sarkar\xe2\x80\x99s classes this semester, said she learned of his policy violation on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nA fifth-year student, Candace Kosted, also heard of Sarkar\xe2\x80\x99s case on Twitter and said the information prompted her to drop a research project she had been working on with him.\nAlthough a teaching assistant has been offering a separate session for students enrolled in Sarkar\xe2\x80\x99s course, Kosted said it feels like the university is \xe2\x80\x9caccommodating him more than anything by allowing him to keep this job.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe university has refused to take quick steps to increase transparency, said one protest organizer, sophomore Tasnim Islam, and it did not take the group\xe2\x80\x99s demands seriously until it got press attention.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchool is supposed to be about learning; you\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged to go to office hours,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged to build relationships with professors.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUT has hired a law firm to review its policies and swiftly formed a campus working group with students and employees. But protesters say bringing in outside experts is \xe2\x80\x9ca step nowhere\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes nothing to address the immediate concerns that students have.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSome students would like to see the professors fired or barred from teaching. Others seek less punitive measures, like having staff and faculty undergo more training about sexual misconduct, and requiring the university to publicize information about instructors\xe2\x80\x99 misconduct histories and explain why some are deemed eligible to continue teaching.\nIn response to open records requests, UT-Austin already releases the names of faculty and employees who violate campus misconduct policies. It also posts sexual misconduct statistics online.\nA university spokesperson, Shilpa Bakre, said in a statement that UT has and \xe2\x80\x9cwill move to terminate faculty and staff members whose violations constitute a safety threat or who engage in violations that warrant termination. The university does so in compliance with our policies, which ensure faculty and staff members receive the required level of due process under federal and state constitutional requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNot all violations rise to a level that would justify termination, she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe type of sanction imposed in a specific situation depends on the facts available at the time, but the intent is for the severity of sanctions imposed to match the severity of the misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEmployees who have violated school policies in the past are observed, and \xe2\x80\x9congoing safety assessments are regularly administered,\xe2\x80\x9d Bakre said. \xe2\x80\x9cShould new allegations of any kind surface, once reported, new investigations will be launched.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe sit-ins come as universities across the country face continuous scrutiny over how they adjudicate sexual misconduct cases and balance due process rights with protecting student victims. Debates similar to the one playing out at UT have occurred at numerous colleges, testing what offenses should follow instructors throughout their professional careers.\nPeter Lake, the director of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University, said there\xe2\x80\x99s been a \xe2\x80\x9ccrescendo\xe2\x80\x9d of institutions facing these quandaries since around 2017, as #MeToo stories made headlines.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is territory that is still very contested,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lake, regarding whether instructors can \xe2\x80\x9cpay the penalty\xe2\x80\x9d for certain misconduct offenses and return to campus. \xe2\x80\x9cInstitutions are caught in the middle of this, trying to balance what to do. There are no clear national standards on this, no obvious objective metric, no standard everyone agrees on.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile he understands students\xe2\x80\x99 desire to know \xe2\x80\x9cif there is a danger lurking and they are unaware,\xe2\x80\x9d Lake likened a list of faculty with misconduct histories to a sex offender registry on campus \xe2\x80\x94 one that could lead to defamation claims or expand to include other misdeeds, from DUIs to battery, assault and weapons offenses.\nUT student protesters said information and rumors about their teachers already spread through whisper networks and that the school could offer accurate facts and context about why certain professors are allowed in the classroom.\nA summary of UT\xe2\x80\x99s investigations shows 11 employees were found to have violated sexual misconduct-related policies between 2013 and mid-2017, including Sarkar, the lone professor on the list. Of the remaining employees, four were terminated, three were not rehired and one resigned. UT is expected to release a more current catalogue, spanning mid-2017 to the present, within two weeks to people who submit public information requests.\nBakre, the university spokesperson, said the working group and the external law firm would look into students\xe2\x80\x99 request that policy violators\xe2\x80\x99 names be proactively published, rather than released through the open records process.\nUT officials have also committed to posting misconduct statistics more frequently, going beyond the mandates of a new state law that requires universities to publish the information annually.\n\"UT takes all allegations of misconduct and assessing potential threats to student safety extremely seriously. Our processes surrounding misconduct are thorough, fair, and of the utmost importance to our mission,\" Bakre said. \"We will continue partnering closely with student leadership and other campus stakeholders to find solutions to these issues.\"\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Students demanded more accountability and transparency from the university about faculty who have been found guilty of sexual misconduct  (Juan Figueroa/ The Dallas Morning News)(Juan Figueroa / Staff photographer)By Mar\xc3\xada  M\xc3\xa9ndez6:00 AM on Dec 1, 2019 CSTLISTENAUSTIN \xe2\x80\x94 In October, University of Texas senior Candace Kosted came across a tweet that unnerved her.It said her environmental ethics professor, Sahotra Sarkar, was suspended for a semester in 2017 for a sexual misconduct violation after students complained that he had invited them to go swimming or pose nude.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cI did have a lot of positive feelings and thoughts toward him before I found out, and then when I heard that news, it was hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kosted, who is from Pflugerville. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9dAdvertisementSo when a group of students stormed into Kosted\xe2\x80\x99s class about a week ago to confront Sarkar and ask other students to walk out in protest, Kosted followed.Political PointsGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.Email AddressBy signing up you agree to our\xc2\xa0Terms of Service\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Privacy PolicySUBMITShe and other students who have participated in several campus protests say they want the university to provide a list of all professors with sexual misconduct violations and to remove the professors from courses or fire them.With roughly one week of classes left in the fall semester, they\xe2\x80\x99re growing impatient and frustrated. But experts say meeting students\xe2\x80\x99 demands would break the precedent of how universities traditionally handle sexual misconduct and could challenge federal and state anti-discrimination and privacy regulations.AdvertisementA legal balancing actThe university hired an external firm last month and is finalizing a working group to review its policies in the wake of the actions of Sarkar and English professor Coleman Hutchison, who was disciplined after making sexual comments to students and failing to disclose a consensual relationship with a graduate student. He returned to the classroom this fall.Sarkar and Hutchison did not respond to multiple emails and calls seeking comment.AdvertisementUnder Title IX, universities must respond to reports of sexual misconduct in a \xe2\x80\x9cprompt and equitable\xe2\x80\x9d manner, said Peter Lake, a law professor at Stetson University in Florida who specializes in the law prohibiting discrimination in education programs.AdvertisementLake said offenses of sexual violence, including rape and assault, generally result in the resignation or firing of university faculty, but consequences for sexual misconduct, such as verbal harassment, historically have not prevented professors from returning to the classroom.Too often, remedies for sexual misconduct have been a \xe2\x80\x9cslap on the wrist\xe2\x80\x9d that allowed the behavior to spread, said Jerry Carbo, an employment law expert and professor at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania.At UT in spring 2017, Sarkar was suspended from teaching, placed on half-time leave without pay and restricted from advising students.AdvertisementHutchison was barred from supervising graduate students by himself, from consideration for promotion to full professor and from appointment to any administrative or leadership positions for two years. The university also canceled plans for him to teach two undergraduate classes in fall 2018.UT officials told The Dallas Morning News that they do not plan to remove Sarkar or Hutchison from teaching.\xe2\x80\x9cThe university actively monitors their transition back into their teaching roles and checks to see if new complaints are submitted. Should new allegations of any kind surface, once reported, new investigations will be launched,\xe2\x80\x9d UT spokeswoman Shilpa Bakre said in an email.Carbo said UT\xe2\x80\x99s penalties appeared to be \xe2\x80\x9cpretty severe\xe2\x80\x9d and beyond the typical responses in the private sector.AdvertisementStill, employers in the private sector have been able to respond more quickly or aggressively to demands for accountability because their employees, unlike university professors, don\xe2\x80\x99t have tenure, said Merrick Rossein, a professor at the CUNY School of Law in New York.Bakre said Sarkar and Hutchison\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstatus as tenured faculty members did not impact the university\xe2\x80\x99s investigation, response to the alleged misconduct, or the range of sanctions imposed.\xe2\x80\x9dBut the #MeToo movement ignited a debate over what should be deemed \xe2\x80\x9cunforgivable\xe2\x80\x9d sexual misconduct offenses, Lake said.Calls for changeWhen Kosted and other students in Sarkar\xe2\x80\x99s class learned about his misconduct, she said, their group chat \xe2\x80\x9cstarted blowing up\xe2\x80\x9d and students were confused about how to react.AdvertisementKosted dropped a research project she had started with Sarkar\xe2\x80\x99s help, and Amanda Brown, a junior from Elkhart, stopped attending the class until the teaching assistant began providing separate lectures for students who felt uncomfortable with Sarkar.Brown went to the first of three sit-ins that students organized. She said her goal isn\xe2\x80\x99t to \xe2\x80\x9cruin\xe2\x80\x9d Sarkar and Hutchison\xe2\x80\x99s lives, but to promote systemic change against sexual misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything, how are we going to stop it from happening in the future?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.That\xe2\x80\x99s also why junior Simone Gabriela Harry said she helped organize the third sit-in. The English honors and Black Studies student from South Padre Island said some students realize the university might not agree to identify or fire all professors accused of sexual misconduct, which experts say would be unprecedented.AdvertisementConcerns about the privacy of affected students generally prevent universities from disclosing details about sexual misconduct cases, Lake said.Students are shifting their focus to requesting more transparency about the university\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX and sexual misconduct procedures, Harry said. A petition with some of those demands has over a thousand signatures.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is about trying to engage with the system of power and trying to undo and prevent more harm within that system,\xe2\x80\x9d said junior Lynn Huynh of Houston, another student organizer.The university launched a central website for Title IX reports and students\xe2\x80\x99 questions about sexual misconduct last month and is expected to receive recommendations from the external firm it hired and a university working group in April.AdvertisementSenate Bill 212, which lawmakers passed this year, requires universities to post at least once every fall and spring semester an online report summarizing Title IX cases.UT officials have promised to roll out improved reporting in January, and Bakre said the university will ask the firm to review best practices for disclosing misconduct.Student organizers say that they hope to host a community-led town hall before the semester ends but that administrators would prefer a university-moderated \xe2\x80\x9ccampus forum.\xe2\x80\x9dBakre said UT is \xe2\x80\x9cpartnering with students to explore every option available\xe2\x80\x9d to productively engage with them.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cWe are focused on creating an environment conducive to a constructive dialogue surrounding issues of misconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.CORRECTION, 10:44 a.m. Dec. 2, 2019: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Peter Lake as David Lake and stated that professor Dan Welcher resigned in October.

Students also say that they were not informed by the university about the professors\xe2\x80\x99 reported behavior.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of the information that we found were from outside sources,\xe2\x80\x9d protest organizer Anilya Krishnan said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe university itself does not have any documentation about these cases.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA resolution calling for the removal of the two professors was passed yesterday by the Senate of College Councils.\nThe resolution states English professor, Coleman Hutchinson violated the university sexual misconduct policy by failing to report a relationship with a student. The resolution also says Coleman was charged with making sexual comments to graduate students.\nThe resolution also lists Integrative Biology and Philosophy professor Sahotra Sarkar. It states that Sarkar violated the university\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX policy after complaints were made of him suggesting students pose for nude photos.\nBoth of these professors are scheduled to teach multiple courses for the upcoming spring semester.\nRelated Content         UT Austin responds to allegations music professor\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\nWith registration opening next week, students took to social media warning others not to enroll in those classes.\nThe university says it was made aware of allegations made against Coleman and Sarkar and took proper action.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth professors that were\xc2\xa0referenced\xc2\xa0today were thoroughly investigated by UT\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Inclusion and Equity when the allegations surfaced,\xe2\x80\x9d UT Communication Strategist Shilpa Bakre said in a statement to KXAN. \xe2\x80\x9cThe investigations did reveal policy violations. When those findings were  rendered, each of the professors completed the sanctions required for their reinstatement.\xe2\x80\x9d\nKXAN has filed a public records request to find out exactly what policies were violated and what sanctions the professors completed to be reinstated \xe2\x80\x94 but has not yet received those records.\nStudents at Friday\xe2\x80\x99s sit-in say they want to be informed by the university when professors are found guilty of violating sexual misconduct policies for their own safety.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurrently if you want information on whether or not a professor has been found guilty of misconduct of any kind, you have to submit a Freedom of Information Act request,\xe2\x80\x9d protest organizer Alyssa Ashcraft said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason that students shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to that information.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUT says that it heard student concerns and takes their safety as a top priority.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe take misconduct seriously and investigate every complaint that is reported,\xe2\x80\x9d Bakre said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe urge students  to report any misconduct that impacts them.\xe2\x80\x9d\nKXAN has also reached out to both Coleman and Sarkar for comment, but have not heard back yet.\nCopyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

Overview\nThis document sets forth the Data Privacy Standards of the University of Texas at Austin (\xe2\x80\x9cUniversity\xe2\x80\x9d) and provides information about the collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data provided to or otherwise collected or processed by the University.\n2. Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a generally applicable University-wide data privacy standard and to provide interested persons with information about the University\xe2\x80\x99s collection, maintenance and use of personal information or data regardless of the lawful bases under or legitimate purpose for which the information was obtained.\xc2\xa0 Subject to state and federal law, the University intends for this policy to be compliant with the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s (\xe2\x80\x9cEU\xe2\x80\x9d) General Data Protection Regulation (\xe2\x80\x9cGDPR\xe2\x80\x9d).\n3. Scope\nThe Data Privacy Standard applies to all domains within the University Web and to any other University action or process concerning the collection, processing, analysis and other data processing of personal information regardless of the method by which such information came to be owned and/or controlled by the University.\nThe University, by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, \xe2\x80\x9cUniversity Web\xe2\x80\x9d). While this policy applies across campus, some University websites may have additional policies and practices regarding privacy that also must be observed.\xc2\xa0 The University\xe2\x80\x99s Data Protection Officer in consultation with the Chief Information Officer must approve any such \xe2\x80\x9clocal\xe2\x80\x9d policies prior to the policy\xe2\x80\x99s implementation.\nThe University\xe2\x80\x99s Web may contain links to third party external websites over which the University has no control.\xc2\xa0 The University disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of external websites regardless of a link to such websites being displayed on the University Web.\nFor the purposes of the policy, \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing\xe2\x80\x9d means obtaining, recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the information or data, including \xe2\x80\x93 organization, adaptation or alteration of the information or data, retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data, disclosure of the information or data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data.\xc2\xa0 A \xe2\x80\x9cdata subject\xe2\x80\x9d is a phrase that refers to the person to whom the personal data relates.\n4. Required Link\nEach University Web application or site shall contain a link to this Privacy Policy.\n5. What is \xe2\x80\x98personal information\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98personal data\xe2\x80\x99?\n\xe2\x80\x98Personal information\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98personal data\xe2\x80\x99 means any information that relates to or identifies a person as an individual.\n6. How Is Personal Information Collected and Processed by The University?\nThe University obtains personal information when a person fills out and submits an application to attend or work at the University along with any additional information the person submits to the University before or after they submit an application.\xc2\xa0 Persons may also provide the University personal information when they apply for an EID from the University or seek financial aid or visit certain parts of the University Web or make use of University Health Services or similar student or employee services.\nIn addition to the application process or an individual requesting University services, the University may also acquire personal information when a person seeks to interact or do business with the University or to participate in research or other activities offered by the University.\xc2\xa0 As discussed elsewhere in this policy, some University Web (as well as third party\xe2\x80\x99s) webpages use \xe2\x80\x9ccookies\xe2\x80\x9d to collect information about the web user.\xc2\xa0 University Web servers (\xe2\x80\x9cWeb Server\xe2\x80\x9d) may also \xe2\x80\x9ccollect\xe2\x80\x9d information about people by generating temporary logs that may contain the following information:\nInternet address (IP address) of computer being used\nWeb pages requested\nReferring Web page\nBrowser used\nDate and Time\nUIN (unique person identifier for EID-based services only)\nThe data collected on the University Web are used in aggregate by\xc2\xa0IT custodians\xc2\xa0to tune the University Web site for its efficiency and are not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web Server logs are only shared with the custodian of each University Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help University Web publishers determine what University Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show that a particular University Web page is very popular or is used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.\nIndividual data gathered through a specific process, such as the submission of an application to attend the University, related submissions, and subsequent interaction with admissions staff, will only be used for its intended purpose, such as the consideration of an applicant for admission or an employment decision, or for certain archiving, research, or statistical purposes described below.\xc2\xa0 Personal information may also come from third parties that are authorized to provide personal information to the University.\nThe University may use personal data it collects for a specific purpose and further process that personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes (\xe2\x80\x9cresearch purposes\xe2\x80\x9d).\xc2\xa0 Processing for research purposes will be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the use of data minimization and pseudonyms when possible.\xc2\xa0 The University will anonymize the personal data it uses for research purposes whenever the University can fulfill the purpose without the need of identification of the personal data subject.\xc2\xa0 The University is not required to provide notice to data subjects when it further processes personal data for research purposes.\nFurther processing of personal data for research purposes is only permitted when the purpose of the processing is to support the University.\xc2\xa0 Further processing of personal data by researchers for their own research purposes is not permitted unless the researcher follows the University\xe2\x80\x99s processes for human subject research, if applicable, and the researcher provides any required notice to the data subjects.\n7. Cookies\nCookies are small pieces of data stored by the University Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages a person has visited. For example, when a person visits some sites on the University Web they might see a \"Welcome Back\" message. The first time the person visited the site, a cookie was probably set on their computer; when they return, the cookie is read again. A person can configure their web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from their hard drive as needed.\nUniversity Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called UT EID. The University uses these cookies so that users will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when they go to different parts of the University Web. Normally, a person is required to enter a UT EID when they request data about themselves or to ensure that they are a member of the University community. For example, students who want to check their admission status or staff members who complete time sheets must enter their UT EID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.\nSome Web Servers may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.\n8. Third-party content on UT Websites\nSome pages within the utexas.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a utexas.edu web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party. Specifically, the following code within a utexas.edu page would represent an example of third party content:\n<img src=\"/%3Ca%20href%3D\"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif\">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif\" alt=\"Sample\" />\nIn this example,\xc2\xa0logo.gif\xc2\xa0would be third party content served from a web server outside the utexas.edu domain (www.other-org.com\xc2\xa0in this case). Third party content in\xc2\xa0utexas.edu\xc2\xa0is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.\nThe University does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when a person visits utexas.edu\xc2\xa0pages that contain third party content, information, such as their IP address, date, browser, and requested page, is transmitted from your computer to that third party.\n9. Grounds for Processing Personal Data and How It is Used by the University\nThe University processes personal data for a number of reasons, including to meet its contractual obligations, the legitimate conduct of its business operations, and to comply with applicable law.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, consent will be the basis for processing personal data.\xc2\xa0 In these cases, the University will ask the data subject for consent to process their personal data and to share that data with third parties. The processing of personal data provided to the University by a data subject or from authorized third parties, like their high school or a national testing service, enables the University to identify the data subject; engage in processing an application or other submission to the University; or verify information already provided to the University.\nThe University may also use or disclose personal data for the following statutory or public interest purposes:\xc2\xa0 to prevent or detect fraud; to monitor equal opportunity; to better serve the needs of students with disabilities with reasonable accommodations; or for research and statistical purposes, the later purpose relying only on aggregate data.\nFurthermore, the University processes personal data either necessary for the University to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with a person (e.g. to assess an offer of services to the University) or for the purposes of a legitimate interest of the University pursued by the University (e.g. equal opportunity monitoring). \xc2\xa0The University requires persons to provide the University with certain information during the application process in order to assess their application properly except where providing personal information is marked as optional.\xc2\xa0 Neither admissions nor employment decisions are automated.\n10. Google Analytics\nSome University Web websites use Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the user visits the site. This information is used to monitor the effectiveness of the website and to consider potential improvements to the website. The information is non-personal and is transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. The University does not share any specific information about a particular user.\nPlease visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics terms of use and Google\'s privacy practices. To opt out of Google\xe2\x80\x99s data collection, read more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.\n11. Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information\nThe University does its best to ensure that the personal information it has is accurate. Users with a UT EID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address at\xc2\xa0UT Direct.\nAlthough no computer system is 100% secure, the University has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.\xc2\xa0 See Information Resources Use and Security Policy https://security.utexas.edu/policies/irusp#standard12\n12. Plan to Respond to Data Breaches\nThe University has policies and procedures in place in case of a data breach or some other incident that places information held by the University in jeopardy.\xc2\xa0 Any individual who believes a data breach has occurred must immediately notify the Chief Information Security Officer, who will investigate the alleged breach and, if necessary, consult with the University\xe2\x80\x99s Data Breach Response Planning Group and the affected department to remediate the breach, including providing any required notices.\nPlease see the two policies below for the University\xe2\x80\x99s full data breach policies (UT EID Required).\nISO Incident Management Procedures\nhttps://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/incident-management-procedures\nPersonally Identifiable Data Breach Notification Plan\nhttps://security.utexas.edu/iso-procedural-documents/data-breach-notification-plan\nIn certain circumstances, the University may be required to provide notice to affected individuals or certain governing authorities if a data breach results in disclosure of personal data.\n13. E-commerce\nSeveral sites within the University Web enable users to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy to only use confidential information that a user enters during a transaction for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.\n14. Open Records Requests and Other Sharing of Information\nExcept for educational records governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\xe2\x80\x9cFERPA\xe2\x80\x9d) or information made confidential by other law, all information provided to and collected from the University Web, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the University Web, and information collected from University Web-based forms, along with any other form or type of document or other instrument containing personal information, may be subject to the\xc2\xa0Texas Public Information Act.\xc2\xa0 Such information may also, in the legal context, be subject to discovery requests or other legal demand that personal data or information be released and made public. \xc2\xa0The same is true for any personal information obtained by the University through other means such as written submission or communications with previous schools or employers.\nThe University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users.\nAs well as circulating application and related materials to the appropriate staff at the University and its various departments and colleges, the University will share personal information for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:\nSchool/college or training organizations;\nExamination boards or testing services;\nIn the case of international applicants, the appropriate state and federal agencies;\nImmigration authorities in order to act as a person\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor for visa purposes;\nGovernmental bodies, including local authorities; the Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 Retirement System; UT Workers Compensation; and other agencies or private actors, such as health care providers, that circumstances require be privy to certain personal information\nOther Higher Education organizations, in order to assist with tracking and research into access to Higher Education; and\nCompanies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, the University and/or one or more of its component colleges, schools, department or programs.\nUnless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act or otherwise compelled by lawful means, or as a party to a legal action, it is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the University Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences. For example, the University\'s portal, UT Direct, enables users to customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot be shared with external third parties, unless required by law.\nConsistent with FERPA and other applicable privacy law, the University does not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless the University receives explicit written consent, is required to do so by law, or for other legitimate ends of the University. \xc2\xa0University students can read more about directory information in the\xc2\xa0University\'s General Information Catalog. Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.\n15. Public Forums\nThe University makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that users disclose in these areas becomes public information, so users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.\nAcademic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Canvas, may be logged. However, FERPA generally prohibits disclosure of these educational records.\n16. Online Surveys\nThe University is a research institution. At any time, the University is conducting numerous online surveys on the University Web. It is University policy only to use personal information gathered in these online surveys for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas Public Information Act or as otherwise compelled by law. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.\n17. Who will process my personal information?\nThe University will internally share the personal information it receives from applications and other information submitted to the University in accordance with the University\xe2\x80\x99s policy and practice.\xc2\xa0 Various university staff and faculty may be involved in processing personal data for the purposes for which the University obtained the data.\xc2\xa0 In some instances, a third-party vendor employed by the University to assist in data processing might process personal data.\xc2\xa0 Data subjects have the right to be notified of such third party processing of their personal information.\n18.\xc2\xa0 What personal information will be processed?\nFor students, the University will use the details provided on their application, together with any supporting documents or other forms of information that an applicant may provide with their application. \xc2\xa0For the purposes of this policy the \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d includes the online application, application fee, an essay, three short answer prompts, your high school transcripts, any college transcripts, test scores, major-specific items, resume, letters of recommendation (not required) and, if applicable, permanent residence card, student information form, course work form and residency affidavit. Different application forms may apply depending on citizen/residency status.\nIn addition to the application form, the University will use the details in a transcript from every senior college the applicant has attended.\xc2\xa0 Where the applicant seeks entry into the graduate Accounting and Nursing programs, University will make use of information from an applicants\xe2\x80\x99 transcripts from all junior and/or community colleges attended as well as past test scores.\xc2\xa0 The individual graduate programs have additional requirements that may require the University to use additional materials.\xc2\xa0 The same applies to any letters of recommendation that are received. \xc2\xa0The University may also rely on personal information that arises from student conduct investigations or hearings.\nFor faculty and staff, the University will process personal information received in an application for employment or through an interview as well as other means, formal and informal, and maintain records of employees.\xc2\xa0 For example, a faculty member may wish to participate in certain health care/insurance programs offered by third party vendors, who have a contract with the University to provide such things.\xc2\xa0 Enrollment in these programs may require sensitive date to be shared with the relevant third party, such as an insurance carrier.\xc2\xa0 The University will also make use of testing or evaluations to assess various aspects of faculty and staff performance.\xc2\xa0 Such information could arise as part of a grievance or disciplinary process.\n19. What rights do I have related to my personal information?\nData subjects have the right to access the personal information that the University holds about them. Data subjects also have the right to ask the University to correct any inaccurate personal information the University holds about them.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, data subjects may request that the University delete personal information, request that the University restrict processing their personal information, or object to the University processing their personal information.\nThere are several laws, including FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\xe2\x80\x9cHIPAA\xe2\x80\x9d) that give data subjects certain rights so far as it pertains to their personal information.\nFERPA\nFERPA provides the right to correct one\xe2\x80\x99s personal data and have access to personal information kept about them.\xc2\xa0 https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html\nAlso, as a general rule but subject to certain exceptions, schools must have written permission from the parent or adult student in order to release any part of the student\xe2\x80\x99s education records.\nHIPAA\nHIPAA provides certain personal data rights to patients who receive healthcare services at covered entities.\xc2\xa0 The University is a hybrid entity, which means that certain departments at the University, including, but not limited to, University Health Services (\xe2\x80\x9cUHS\xe2\x80\x9d) and Dell Medical School, are subject to HIPAA.\xc2\xa0 Each University department that is subject to HIPAA will provide a Notice of Privacy Practices to patients detailing their rights under HIPAA, including their personal data rights.\xc2\xa0 For example, a data subject may find the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by UHS at the following link: https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/images/pdf/privacypractices.pdf.\nTexas Public Information Act\nThe\xc2\xa0Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives a person the right to be informed about the information that the University collects about them. It also gives a person the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the University correct any of that information that is wrong. Requests to receive and review any of that information, or request corrections to it, may be made by contacting the University\'s Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box 8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (email:\xc2\xa0cfo@www.utexas.edu).\nGDPR\nThe GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect May 25, 2018.\xc2\xa0 The GDPR\xe2\x80\x99s intent is to regulate the gathering, use and maintenance of personally identifiable information about a natural person and providing certain rights to the data subject, such as the right to erasure and the right to object to the use of personal data.\xc2\xa0 This law applies to any person, citizen or not, who at the time of the data collection is located in the European Union.\xc2\xa0 It does not require an entity, like the University, to be located or acting within the EU for jurisdiction to attach; however, a non-EU entity like the University must process personal data related to the offering of goods or services in the EU or to the monitoring of a person\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in the EU for jurisdiction to attach.\nYou have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information in accordance with all applicable laws. The erasure of your information will be subject to the retention periods of applicable federal and state law and the University\xe2\x80\x99s Record Retention Schedule. If you have provided consent to the use of your information, you have the right to withdraw consent without affecting the lawfulness of the University\'s use of the information prior to receipt of your request.\xc2\xa0 A Data Subject may exercise their rights by contacting the University\xe2\x80\x99s Data Protection Officer.\nIf you feel the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such information, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in the European Union.\nThe State of Texas and the United States also have laws that address privacy generally and the use of certain types of records, such as educational and health records (described above), that contain personally identifiable information.\xc2\xa0 Texas has laws that govern records retention and finally, under US/Texas law, the University may have good reason to keep the information despite a conflict with the GDPR.\nAs a general rule, in cases where Texas or Federal law conflict with the laws of other countries in regard to the processing, use or maintenance of a data subject\xe2\x80\x99s personal information, including provisions of the GDPR, the University will treat Texas and Federal law as controlling.\nUniversity employees who receive a request by a Data Subject to have their data forgotten or who have other questions regarding the rights of Data Subjects provided by the GDPR should contact the University\xe2\x80\x99s Data Protection Officer.\n20. How long is my information kept?\nThe University is an agency of the state of Texas and must follow a records retention schedule, which may be found at: https://financials.utexas.edu/hbp/part-20/2-1-records-management-services-documents.\xc2\xa0 Generally, the University will keep records of applicants for admission or employment for the following periods of time:\nApplicants for admission who do not matriculate into the University: one year after the semester during which an individual applies for admission to the University;\nApplicants for admission who matriculate into the University: five years after graduation or the last day of attendance;\nApplicants for employment who are not hired: two years from the end of the fiscal year during which the individual applies for employment; and\nApplicants for employment who are hired: five years after the end of employment.\nSome departments may be subject to other laws that require the department to keep certain personal information for a prescribed period.\nPlease see the records retention schedule for more information.\xc2\xa0 The University may update the records retention schedule from time to time.\n21. Who can I contact for assistance or to complain?\nStudents with questions about how their personal information is used, or who wish to exercise any of their rights, may consult this policy and contact the Dean of Students, an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/, \xc2\xa0or the office that oversees their primary area of study (major).\xc2\xa0 They may also contact the Registrar\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 https://registrar.utexas.edu/\nFaculty may seek assistance from the chair of their department, the Dean of their college or equivalent position, a representative on the Faculty Council or the Provosts\xe2\x80\x99 office or an ombudsperson https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.\nAn employee, should contact their immediate supervisor first, and then if necessary proceed up the chain of command.\xc2\xa0 Employees are also free to contact the Ombuds office https://ombuds.utexas.edu/.\nFor further assistance, please contact University Compliance Services at Compliance@austin.utexas.edu or call 512-232-7055, the University\xe2\x80\x99s Data Protection Officer, Chris Hutto, chris.hutto@austin.utexas.edu, or the appropriate \xc2\xa0college, office or department.\n22.
