The South Carolina Code on the General Assembly's website is now current through the 2023 Session of the General Assembly. The Code of Laws on this website will be updated online periodically; however, the official version of the Code of Laws remains the print version which will continue to be updated on a yearly basis before the start of each legislative session. The South Carolina Code, consisting only of Code text, numbering, history, and Effect of Amendment, Editor's, and Code Commissioner's notes may be copied from this website at the reader's expense and effort without need for permission.\nThe Legislative Council is unable to assist users of this service with legal questions. Also, legislative staff cannot respond to requests for legal advice or the application of the law to specific facts. Therefore, to understand and protect your legal rights, you should consult your own private lawyer regarding all legal questions.\nWhile every effort was made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the South Carolina Code available on the South Carolina General Assembly's website, this version of the South Carolina Code is not official, and the state agencies preparing this website and the General Assembly are not responsible for any errors or omissions which may occur in these files. Only the current published volumes of the South Carolina Code of Laws Annotated and any pertinent acts and joint resolutions contain the official version.\nPlease note that the Legislative Council is not able to respond to individual inquiries regarding research or the features, format, or use of this website. However, you may notify the Legislative Services Agency at LSA@scstatehouse.gov regarding any apparent errors or omissions in content of Code sections on this website, in which case LSA will relay the information to appropriate staff members of the South Carolina Legislative Council for investigation.\nTitle 1 - Administration of the Government\nTitle 2 - General Assembly\nTitle 3 - U.S. Government, Agreements and Relations With\nTitle 4 - Counties\nTitle 5 - Municipal Corporations\nTitle 6 - Local Government - Provisions Applicable to Special Purpose\nDistricts and Other Political Subdivisions\nTitle 7 - Elections\nTitle 8 - Public Officers and Employees\nTitle 9 - Retirement Systems\nTitle 10 - Public Buildings and Property\nTitle 11 - Public Finance\nTitle 12 - Taxation\nTitle 13 - Planning, Research and Development\nTitle 14 - Courts\nTitle 15 - Civil Remedies and Procedures\nTitle 16 - Crimes and Offenses\nTitle 17 - Criminal Procedures\nTitle 18 - Appeals\nTitle 19 - Evidence\nTitle 20 - Domestic Relations\nTitle 21 - Estates, Trusts, Guardians and Fiduciaries\nTitle 22 - Magistrates and Constables\nTitle 23 - Law Enforcement and Public Safety\nTitle 24 - Corrections, Jails, Probations, Paroles and Pardons\nTitle 25 - Military, Civil Defense and Veterans Affairs\nTitle 26 - Notaries Public and Acknowledgements\nTitle 27 - Property and Conveyances\nTitle 28 - Eminent Domain\nTitle 29 - Mortgages and Other Liens\nTitle 30 - Public Records\nTitle 31 - Housing and Redevelopment\nTitle 32 - Contracts and Agents\nTitle 33 - Corporations, Partnerships and Associations\nTitle 34 - Banking, Financial Institutions and Money\nTitle 35 - Securities\nTitle 36 - Commercial Code\nTitle 37 - Consumer Protection Code\nTitle 38 - Insurance\nTitle 39 - Trade and Commerce\nTitle 40 - Professions and Occupations\nTitle 41 - Labor and Employment\nTitle 42 - Workers' Compensation\nTitle 43 - Social Services\nTitle 44 - Health\nTitle 45 - Hotels, Motels, Restaurants and Boardinghouses\nTitle 46 - Agriculture\nTitle 47 - Animals, Livestock and Poultry\nTitle 48 - Environmental Protection and Conservation\nTitle 49 - Waters, Water Resources and Drainage\nTitle 50 - Fish, Game and Watercraft\nTitle 51 - Parks, Recreation and Tourism\nTitle 52 - Amusements and Athletic Contests\nTitle 53 - Sundays, Holidays and Other Special Days\nTitle 54 - Ports and Maritime Matters\nTitle 55 - Aeronautics\nTitle 56 - Motor Vehicles\nTitle 57 - Highways, Bridges and Ferries\nTitle 58 - Public Utilities, Services and Carriers\nTitle 59 - Education\nTitle 60 - Libraries, Archives, Museums and Arts\nTitle 61 - Alcohol and Alcoholic Beverages\nTitle 62 - South Carolina Probate Code\nTitle 63 - South Carolina Children's Code\nOTHER LEGAL RESEARCH DATA BASES:\nCode of Regulations\nGlobal Legal Information Catalog - Law Library of Congress\nSouth Carolina Legislative Services Agency * 223 Blatt Building * 1105 Pendleton Street * Columbia, SC 29201\nDisclaimer * Policies * Photo Credits * Contact Us\nLegislative Services Agency\nh t t p : / / w w w . s c s t a t e h o u s e . g o v\""];
