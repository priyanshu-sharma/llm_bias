Title IX Frequently Asked Questions
USU is committed to maintaining an educational and working environment free from sex discrimination and harassment, including maintaining an environment in which no student, faculty, or staff member is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of USU's programs and activities as a result of one's sex. See interim USU Policy 339.
In compliance with Title IX, the Office of Equity works to create a learning and working environment free from sex discrimination and sexual misconduct through its prevention efforts and by providing a grievance process and offering support and resources to those who have been impacted by sexual misconduct. You can contact the Office of Equity or visit equity.usu.edu for information about supportive measures, reporting options, and the sexual misconduct grievance process.
What is Title IX?
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects people from sex discrimination at institutions that receive financial assistance from the federal government. Sexual misconduct – including sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence (dating and domestic violence), and stalking – is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title IX and by USU. The university is obligated to take prompt and effective steps to end sexual misconduct and sex discrimination when it occurs, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its effects.
What is sexual misconduct?
Sexual misconduct is a broad policy term that includes sexual harassment (quid pro quo and hostile environment), sexual assault, relationship violence, sexual exploitation, and sex-based stalking. Sexual misconduct is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by interim USU Policies 339 and 339A. The previous policies related to sexual misconduct are applicable to conduct alleged to have occurred August 14, 2020 or later per 34 CFRR 106 (2020). They are subject to change at any time.
A person of any sex can engage in sexual misconduct, and it can occur between people of the same or different sexes.
Using the term "sexual misconduct" serves to differentiate university policy processes, which are administrative and educational, from the criminal justice system, in which people are charged with crimes that carry criminal penalties.
How should sexual misconduct be reported?
Sexual misconduct that is committed by students, employees, and visitors to USU campuses violates interim USU Policies 339 and 339A and is not tolerated.
To report sexual misconduct, contact the USU Title IX Coordinator by reporting online at equity.usu.edu/report, calling 435-797-1266, emailing titleix@usu.edu, or visiting Distance Education room 400 on the Logan campus.
Sexual misconduct can also be reported to a Reporting Employee, who is required to report the information to the USU Title IX Coordinator. A list of Reporting Employees is available in interim USU policy 340.
Is there a time limit for making a sexual misconduct report to the USU Title IX Coordinator?
There is no time limit for making reports to the USU Title IX Coordinator, but reporting as soon as possible after an incident gives the University a better chance to respond promptly and effectively. After a significant amount of time passes, it may be difficult to gather evidence to determine whether a policy violation occurred.
What is the role of the USU Title IX Coordinator with respect to sexual misconduct?
The USU Title IX Coordinator is the person designated by USU to coordinate USU's efforts to implement and monitor compliance with the university's sexual misconduct policies and with federal Title IX law and regulations more generally.
As such, the Title IX Coordinator has three main roles:
Promptly responding to reports of alleged sexual misconduct
Coordinating effective implementation of supportive measures to individuals impacted by sexual misconduct
Following a prompt and equitable grievance process to address sexual misconduct
What options are available through the Office of Equity for an individual who experienced sexual misconduct?
An individual who has experienced sexual misconduct has options and can choose from the options that they believe are best for them:
An individual may receive supportive measures, even without filing a formal compliant.
An individual may also file a formal complaint, where they provide information about the sexual misconduct and agree that they want the university to move forward with an alternative resolution or a formal investigation.
During an alternative resolution, the parties mutually agree on the outcome that addresses the sexual misconduct raised in the formal complaint.
A formal investigation occurs when both parties are interviewed, provide evidence, and participate in a hearing for reports under interim USU Policy 339. If the individual who engaged in the behavior is found to have violated university policy, appropriate sanctions are instituted.
What are supportive measures?
Supportive measures are short-term, non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services that are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the University’s Employment or Education Program or Activity without unreasonably burdening the other party and include measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the University’s educational environment, and/or to deter Sexual Misconduct. They may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, mutual no-contact orders, employment modifications, or financial aid appeals.
An individual can access supportive measures even if they do not file a formal complaint or choose not to proceed with a formal investigation.
What is the difference between reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator and reporting to police? What standard of evidence is used in these processes?
The university’s formal investigation process, which is coordinated by the USU Office of Equity, is an administrative process that determines whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, a member of the campus community (student, staff, or faculty) has violated interim USU Policy 339 or 339A. The preponderance of the evidence standard means a policy violation is more likely than not to have occurred. If someone is found responsible for violating university policy, they may face administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, a warning, probation, suspension, or expulsion. The information about sexual misconduct that is reported may also result in campus offices participating in education and training.
A criminal process, which may be coordinated by USU Police or local law enforcement, determines whether a crime has occurred. If someone wishes to seek criminal penalties for sexual misconduct that is also a crime or other forms of assistance from law enforcement, they can report to the police. Criminal justice procedures use beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard of evidence, which is a higher standard of evidence than the standard used in USU’s grievance process.
Both processes may be pursued simultaneously.
What if the individual who experienced sexual misconduct wants to keep their information confidential?
The USU Title IX Coordinator will consider requests for confidentiality (meaning that an individual doesn’t want their name connected to the incident or report) or that no investigation or disciplinary action be pursued. These requests are evaluated in the context of the university’s responsibility to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment.
An individual has the option of not providing information to the Office of Equity and not pursuing an investigation. However, the Office of Equity will still conduct a safety assessment with the limited information available to ensure the safety of the campus community.
Confidential resources are available both on- and off-campus.
Does USU discipline students for drug and alcohol student code violations discovered when reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator?
No, if a student who experiences or witnesses an incident of sexual misconduct reports it to the USU Title IX Coordinator, they will not get in trouble for a student code violation related to the incident, such as underage drinking or having alcohol on campus.
The health and safety of our community is our primary concern, and we want to remove barriers to reporting sexual misconduct to USU's Title IX Coordinator. USU’s student code includes an amnesty provision to excuse students who report sexual misconduct from facing discipline for a student code violation involving drugs and alcohol.
What are the reporting obligations of USU staff, faculty, and other academic appointees?
Some university employees are designated as reporting employees, which means they must report all information they receive about sexual misconduct or incidents of sexual misconduct about which they have knowledge to the USU Title IX Coordinator at equity.usu.edu/report.
The university provides designated confidential resources - medical professionals and medical staff, professional counselors, non-professional counselors, and advocates - so individuals who have been impacted by sexual misconduct can have access to support services in a confidential setting.
Some university employees are designated as non-designated employees, which means they are not required to report information they receive about sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator, but are required to share information about resources and reporting to the Title IX Coordinator to individuals who disclose sexual misconduct to them.
Who does the Office of Equity share the initial report with?
The Office of Equity keeps the initial report private but may share some information with specific USU employees, including when it is necessary to assess the safety risk posed by an incident or to provide an individual with supportive measures.
For example, if there is an immediate safety risk to an individual or to campus, the USU Title IX Coordinator may share information with local police or USU Police, including so that USU Police may evaluate for a timely warning notice, in accordance with the federal Clery Act. Timely warnings are a way to let the USU community about certain crimes that have occurred on campus, but do not include information that would identify the individual who allegedly experienced the sexual misconduct.

Access to Personally Identifiable Information From Governmental Websites and the Governmental Records Access and Management Act
Because USU is a state institution, some information collected from USU websites and USU-published mobile applications may be subject to the Government Records Access and Management Act (“GRAMA”), Utah Code Section 63G-2-101 et seq. In addition, USU may disclose information to third parties when such disclosure is required or permitted by law.

All records that are prepared, owned, received, or retained by a governmental entity that may be reproduced by certain means are considered public, unless they are private, controlled, or protected, as outlined in GRAMA, or are records to which access is restricted according to court rule, other State law, federal law, or federal regulation.
Information that is generally considered public record under GRAMA and not made confidential elsewhere in the Utah Code or by federal law, may be subject to electronic access through the USU website. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is not a classification of records under GRAMA.
Information about GRAMA can be found on the USU Website and on the Utah State Legislature website.
How We Protect Collected Information
USU uses reasonable measures to safeguard personal information collected on its sites depending on its sensitivity. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have suitable physical, technical, and administrative controls and procedures to safeguard the information we collect online. Our measures follow applicable laws regarding the safeguarding of information under our control. However, no information system can be 100 percent secure.USU is not responsible for the security of information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control, including the Internet, email systems, and wireless networks. Moreover, you are responsible for protecting your username and password and for selecting strong passwords.
We retain the information we collect online no longer than as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect the information and to comply with our legal obligations.
Non-USU Websites
Various websites may be linked through www.usu.edu. Many of these sites, including private sector sites, are not subject to GRAMA and may also not be subject to other sections of the Utah Code or federal law, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Visitors to those sites are advised to check the privacy notices of these sites and be cautious about providing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without a clear understanding of how the information will be used.

Sexual Misconduct Policy Terms
The university prohibits employees, students, and third parties from engaging in relationship violence, sex-based stalking, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, and sexual harassment (collectively referred to herein as “sexual msconduct”). The university will take swift action to address sexual misconduct when the university has actual knowledge that it has occurred.
Sexual Misconduct is referred to as "sexual harassment" in 34 C.F.R. § 106.30 (2020). Sexual misconduct is conduct on the basis of sex including one or more of the following types of conduct:
Relationship violence;
Sex-based stalking;
Sexual assault;
Sexual exploitation; and
Sexual harassment.
Protected speech alone does not constitute sexual harassment; rather, a course of conduct must include something beyond mere expression of views, words, symbols or thoughts that a person finds offensive to be sexual harassment. To be considered sexual harassment, a course of conduct must be considered sufficiently serious that it effectively denies a person equal access to an employment or education program or activity, which is evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person in the claimant’s position, considering all the circumstances, including the claimant’s age.
Visit interim USU Policies 339 and 339A and USU Policy 533 for more information about sexual misconduct. Policies 339 and 339A related to sexual misconduct are applicable to conduct alleged to have occurred August 14, 2020 or later per 34 C.F.R. 106 (2020). They are subject to change at any time.
Sexual Misconduct Definitions
Relationship Violence
Relationship violence includes dating violence and domestic violence.
Dating Violence
Dating violence includes violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the claimant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (a) the length of the relationship, (b) the nature of the relationship, and (c) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
Domestic Violence
Domestic violence includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed against the claimant by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the claimant, by a person with whom the claimant shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the claimant as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the claimant under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred, or by any other person against an adult or youth claimant who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction. A criminal charge or conviction is not a predicate for an allegation of domestic violence to be brought under this policy.
Potential Examples of Relationship Violence
Physical violence - hitting, slapping, punching
Sexual assault
Coercion and threats - threats to hurt, kill, die by suicide, end the relationship, report someone to authorities
Intimidation - threatening looks, actions, gestures; destroying property; abusing pets; displaying weapons; stalking
Sex-based Stalking
Sex-based stalking is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person or persons based on sex, that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or for the safety of others or to suffer substantial emotional distress. Stalking may occur in person, by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, device, or method.
A course of conduct is two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through a third party, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, intimidates, harasses, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, method, device, or means.
Potential Examples of Sex-based Stalking
Repeated and unwanted phone calls or texts
Repeated and unwanted contact on social media
Following or spying
Showing up somewhere without a legitimate reason to be there
Contacting friends, family, work, etc. for information about someone
Posting information or spreading rumors online or by word of mouth
Using technology to track someone's movements or whereabouts
Collecting information about patterns, job, classes, friends, etc.
Monitoring phone calls, emails, social media, etc.
Sexual Assault
Sexual Assault includes any sexual act or attempted sexual act, including rape, sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or fondling, directed against another person without their consent. This includes instances where the person is incapable of giving consent because of their age or incapacitation. Sexual assault also includes unlawful sexual acts, such as incest and statutory rape.
Rape
Rape is sexual intercourse with another person without their consent.
Sodomy
Sodomy is oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person without their consent.
Sexual Assault with An Object
Sexual Assault with An Object is the use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person without their consent.
Fondling
Fondling is the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification without their consent.
Incest
Incest is sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law (e.g., a sibling or parent/child relationship).
Statutory Rape
Statutory Rape is sexual intercourse with a person who is under Utah’s statutory age of consent.
Potential Examples of Sexual Assault
Guilting someone into sexual activity
Changing the sexual activity without the other person’s consent
Engaging in sexual activity when someone is incapacitated or unconscious
Engaging in sexual activity when someone hasn’t affirmatively consented, even if they didn’t say no
Using threats to force someone into sexual activity
Using power or influence to coerce someone into sexual activity
Sexual Exploitation
Sexual Exploitation is taking non-consensual sexual advantage of another for one’s own advantage or benefit, or to the benefit or advantage anyone other than the claimant. Examples include, but are not limited to:
Observing, recording, or photographing nudity or sexual activity of one or more persons without their consent in a location where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy;
Allowing another to observe, record, or photograph nudity or sexual activity of one or more persons without their consent where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy; or
Distributing recordings, photographs, or other images of the nudity or sexual activity of one or more persons without their consent.
Sexual Harassment
Sexual Harassment includes hostile environment and quid pro quo.
Hostile Environment
Hostile Environment is unwelcome sex-based conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to an employment or education program or activity.
Quid Pro Quo
Quid Pro Quo is an employee’s conditioning the provision of a university aid, benefit, or service on a person’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct.
Potential Examples of Sexual Harassment
Unwelcome and repeated sexual comments, references, or jokes
Asking unwelcome personal questions about someone's body or intimate relationships
Unwelcome talking about someone's sex life
Repeatedly asking someone out when the answer is "no"
Unwelcome and repeated references to someone as hunk, doll, babe, honey, etc.
Unwelcome and repeated catcalling or whistling
Sending repeated and unwelcome sexual language or images through technology (text, email, social media)
Unwelcome and repeated sexual gestures with hands or body movements
Unwelcome and repeated looking at a person up and down (elevator eyes)
Paying unwanted sexual attention to someone
Displaying unwelcome sexually suggestive visuals
Suggestively making unwelcome facial expressions (winking, licking lips, etc.)
Unwelcome and repeated hanging around, standing too close, or brushing up against someone
Unwelcome and repeated touching of a person's clothing, hair, etc.
Unwelcome and repeated massaging of a person's neck, shoulders, etc.
Unwelcome and repeated hugging, kissing, patting, or stroking of someone
Unwelcome and repeated touching or rubbing oneself sexually in view of others
Consent Definition
Consent is an affirmative agreement to do the same thing at the same time in the same way. An affirmative agreement includes an informed, freely and actively given, mutually understandable exchange of unmistakable words or actions, which indicate an affirmative willingness to participate in mutually agreed upon sexual activity. Consent can be withdrawn or modified at any time, as long as such withdrawal or modification is clearly communicated.
Consent cannot be assumed based on silence, the absence of “no” or “stop,” the existence of a prior or current relationship, or prior sexual activity. There is no consent when there is force, coercion, or incapacitation.
Examples of Consensual Behavior
May include, but are not limited to:
Verbal statements of “yes” or “okay”
Head nodding
Asking someone to engage in the sexual activity
Examples of Non-Consensual Behavior
May include, but are not limited to:
Verbal statements of “no” or “I don’t want to”
Verbal statements of “I don’t know” or “maybe”
Pushing someone away
Resisting contact
Shrugging or other uncertain body language
Not actively participating in the sexual activity
No response or silence
Disengaging from previous consensual behavior
Force, coercion, or incapacitation
Coercion, Incapacitation, and Force Definitions
Coercion
Coercion may consist of intimidation, threats, or other severe conduct that causes a reasonable person to fear significant consequences if they refuse to engage in sexual contact.
Incapacitation
Incapacitation is a state in which a person lacks the ability, temporarily or permanently, to give consent to sexual activity including because of a disability, drug or alcohol consumption (whether voluntary or involuntary), or because the person is unconscious, asleep, immobilized, or otherwise unaware that the sexual activity is occurring. A person is not necessarily incapacitated solely as a result of drinking or using drugs; the level of impairment must be significant enough to render the person unable to give consent.
It is not an excuse that the party initiating sexual contact was intoxicated and therefore did not realize the other person’s incapacity. In evaluating cases involving alleged Incapacitation, the university considers whether the person initiating the sexual conduct knew or should have known the other person was incapacitated.
Force
Force includes the use of physical force or threats of force that affects a person's ability to give consent to sexual contact.
Retaliation Definition
Retaliation is taking adverse action, including any action that might deter a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity, because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, participated, or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, formal or informal proceeding, or other procedure under policies 340, 339, 339A, or 305. A causal relationship between an adverse action and good faith reporting or participation under this Policy (policy 305) is needed to demonstrate that retaliation has occurred.
Potential Examples of Retaliation
Adverse employment or educational action - demoting, terminating, firing; denying a promotion or leave; making adverse pay decisions; giving a lower grade or performance review than deserved; dismissing someone from a class, program, team, workspace, etc.
Intimidating, threatening, or harassing actions - threatening dismissal from a program or expulsion from the university; threatening to disclose confidential information or report an individual to authorities (e.g., immigration authorities); making intentionally false or misleading statements that would dissuade a reasonable person from making a complaint of Sexual Misconduct

Designated Confidential Resources
Designated confidential resources provide an individual who discloses information about sexual misconduct with information about support services and reporting options. Information shared with a designated confidential resource will not trigger university action.
Trained advocates are available through USU's Sexual Assault and Anti-Violence Information (SAAVI) office and through community agencies (see community resources below). Advocates will help you navigate your options, seek medical attention, get a sexual assault forensic exam, receive counseling, file a police report, or report to the university.
Find Confidential Counseling
USU's Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides confidential mental health services and same-day crisis appointments to students.
USU's Mind-Body Bridging Clinic provides individual therapeutic sessions focused on Mind-Body Bridging, a practice that helps build self- and emotional-regulation skills and enhance overall mental health. This clinic is available to both students and employees via self-referral or through CAPS or SAAVI referral.
Get Medical Attention
If you experienced a sexual assault or relationship violence, a medical professional can treat injuries, even those you may not be able to see, including sexually transmitted infections. Consider seeing a medical professional right away to take care of your health.
Students in Logan
USU Student Health Center to schedule an appointment
Students at USU Eastern
USU Eastern Health Services to schedule an appointment.
Statewide
Students at other statewide campuses and USU employees should visit a local health care provider.
Preserve Evidence
After a sexual assault, DNA evidence can be collected from your body, clothing, and other personal belongings. A sexual assault forensic exam, or SAFE exam, ensures you receive important medical attention and can preserve possible DNA evidence. A forensic exam is ideal within 72 hours after the assault.
To preserve evidence, try not to bathe, shower, use the restroom, change your clothes, comb your hair, or clean up. If you receive a sexual assault forensic exam, certain information must be given to police according to Utah law, but you are not required to pursue a police investigation. You will also be provided with treatment for injuries.
Logan
If you are a Logan campus student or employee, go directly to Cache Valley Hospital to receive care from a certified Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner.
Statewide
If you are not a Logan campus student or employee, review the Community Resources map below to learn where you can get a sexual assault forensic exam.
Request Supportive Measures
Whether or not you want to pursue the Office of Equity grievance process, you may receive supportive measures, such as academic accommodations or changes to on-campus housing, class, or work schedules.
Report to USU Title IX Coordinator
Any USU student or employee may report sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Equity. Reports can be filed online at equity.usu.edu/report.
Title IX Coordinator: Cody Carmichaelcody.carmichael@usu.edu | 435-797-1266Office of Equity, Distance Education 400, USU Logan campus
USU offers amnesty for drug and alcohol policy violations of the Student Code when a student reports an incident of sexual misconduct, whether they experienced or witnessed it. For example, if you experience or witness sexual assault and report it to the Title IX Coordinator, you will not get in trouble for a student code violation such as underage drinking or having alcohol on campus. Students who participate as a witness in a sexual misconduct grievance process are also granted amnesty, though they may be encouraged to participate in health education.
Report to Law Enforcement
Sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking can be reported to the local law enforcement agency that serves the area where the incident took place. If you need help identifying the appropriate law enforcement agency, contact USU Police at 435-797-1939.
USU's Office of Equity or SAAVI can assist an individual with filing a report with USUPD or local law enforcement. Also, the Office of Equity can provide supportive measures, including accommodations such as adjusted deadlines and excused absences, to accommodate participating in the criminal process.
If an incident occurred on the Logan, Eastern, or Blanding campuses, you may report to university police (below). USU Police forward all reports of sexual misconduct to USU's Title IX Coordinator. You can pursue a police investigation and the university's grievance process at the same time.

Title IX and Out of Classroom Learning Experiences
USU enforces Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Under the law, sex-based discrimination is defined as someone being excluded from participation in, being denied the benefits of, or being subjected to discrimination on the basis of their sex assigned at birth. USU policy 305 additionally prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.
Sex-based discrimination also includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, sexual exploitation, and sex-based stalking. These specific behaviors prohibited by Title IX are collectively called “sexual misconduct” in interim USU policies 339 and 339A.
Title IX applies to all individuals participating in educational programs or activities that are affiliated with USU, which includes students who experience sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) during an out of classroom learning experience (internship, practicum, student teaching, field work, research process, etc.).
To report sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) to USU, visit equity.usu.edu/report or contact USU’s Title IX Coordinator at 435-797-1266, titleix@usu.edu, or in Distance Education 400 on the USU Logan campus.
Information for USU Students, USU Faculty/Staff advisors and coordinators, and Placement Site Supervisors
USU Students
If you or someone you know is experiencing sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) in an out of classroom learning experience, below are some actions you can take. Remember, it is normal to be afraid or worried about reporting sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) or taking other actions to make the behaviors stop. Do what is right for you.
While USU may not have control over the person engaging in the sex-based discrimination in an out of classroom learning experience, the university can help remove you from the out of classroom learning experience and offer support and access to resources to you.
Report to USU’s Title IX Coordinator: Students can report sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) at equity.usu.edu/report or by contacting USU’s Title IX Coordinator at 435-797-1266, titleix@usu.edu, or in Distance Education room 400 on the USU Logan campus. If you choose to report to USU, the Office of Equity will provide you with information about supportive measures, support resources, and actions that may be taken based on the information that is provided.
Report to your placement site supervisor or your site’s human resources office/department/Title IX Coordinator (if applicable): They can tell you what resources the employer can offer and the investigation process for the site. If your supervisor is the individual engaging in the sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct), you could report to their supervisor or human resources.
Report to your USU out of classroom learning experiences coordinator or advisor: Coordinators and advisors work closely with placement sites to appropriately place USU students for their out of classroom learning experiences, so it is important that they are aware of any inappropriate or unlawful conduct at those sites. Out of classroom learning experiences coordinators and advisors may be obligated to report disclosures of sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator. You can learn more about USU employee sexual misconduct reporting obligations at equity.usu.edu/sexual-misconduct/employees.
Visit sexualrespect.usu.edu for a list of campus and community resources available to you. These include confidential resources such as counseling and USU’s Sexual Assault and Anti-Violence Information (SAAVI) Office, as well as reporting options.
USU Faculty and Staff advisors and coordinators
As a USU faculty or staff member who advises or coordinates out of classroom learning experiences, it is important for you to talk to students about their Title IX rights prior to them beginning their out of classroom learning experience.
Provide students with the information and resources found in the above student section of this "Title IX and out of classroom learning experiences" webpage.
Encourage students to find out who at their placement site (supervisor, human resources, or Title IX Coordinator (if applicable)) they can contact about sex-based discrimination and sexual harassment and where to review the site’s relevant respectful workplace, sexual harassment, and/or discrimination policies.
If a student informs you of sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) in their out of classroom learning experience, follow the below steps.
Listen, affirm, and inform: Demonstrate care and concern during your conversation with the individual. They may fear they won’t be believed or have concerns with telling someone about the incident. If you are a reporting employee, explain your sexual misconduct reporting obligations and that you will need to report the incident to the USU Title IX Coordinator.
Provide resources: Talk to the individual about USU and community resources they can access for further support. USU provides a variety of confidential resources and reporting options. Contact information and a description of these resources can be found at sexualrespect.usu.edu.
If you are a reporting employee, report the disclosure to the USU Title IX Coordinator: USU faculty and staff designated as reporting employees are required to report disclosures of sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator. Reports can be made at equity.usu.edu/report.
Even if you are not a reporting employee, the USU Title IX Coordinator wants to know about sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) that is happening to students in out of classroom learning experiences. Sharing this information with the USU Title IX Coordinator ensures that students can be informed about supportive measures, support resources, and actions that may be taken based on the information that is provided. You can contact USU’s Title IX Coordinator at 435-797-1266, titleix@usu.edu, or in Distance Education room 400 on the USU Logan campus or file a report at equity.usu.edu/report.
Out of Classroom Learning Experiences Placement Sites and Site Supervisors
As a placement site or site supervisor for a USU student’s out of classroom learning experience, it is important for you to talk to students about their Title IX and Title VII rights prior to them beginning their out of classroom learning experience at your site.
Provide USU students with the information and resources found in the above student section of this "Title IX and out of classroom learning experiences" webpage.
Tell students who at your placement site (supervisor, human resources, or Title IX Coordinator (if applicable)) they can contact about sex-based discrimination and sexual harassment and where to review your site’s relevant respectful workplace, sexual harassment, and/or discrimination policies.
If a USU student informs you of experiencing sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) in their out of classroom learning experience at your site, follow the below steps.
Listen and Affirm: Demonstrate care and concern during your conversation with the individual. They may fear they won’t be believed or have concerns with telling someone about the incident.
Discuss and follow all workplace policies for sexual harassment and discrimination: Inform the student of the procedures for reporting incidents at your workplace. Contact your workplace’s human resources department/officer if appropriate and/or support the student in doing so.
Consider reporting the information to USU’s Title IX Coordinator: Reports can be made at equity.usu.edu/report, 435-797-1266, titleix@usu.edu, or in Distance Education room 400 on the USU Logan campus. If you choose to report the incident(s) to USU, inform the student so that they can be prepared to be contacted by USU about supportive measures, support resources, and actions that may be taken based on the information that is provided.
Assist and cooperate with USU’s Office of Equity: As necessary, you may need to be involved in an investigation related to sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) incidents that occur to a USU student placed at your site.
Remind students of USU resources: Remind the individual about campus and community resources they can access for further support. USU provides a variety of confidential resources and reporting options. Contact information and a description of these resources can be found at sexualrespect.usu.edu.

Title IX Frequently Asked Questions
USU is committed to maintaining an educational and working environment free from sex discrimination and harassment, including maintaining an environment in which no student, faculty, or staff member is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of USU's programs and activities as a result of one's sex. See interim USU Policy 339.
In compliance with Title IX, the Office of Equity works to create a learning and working environment free from sex discrimination and sexual misconduct through its prevention efforts and by providing a grievance process and offering support and resources to those who have been impacted by sexual misconduct. You can contact the Office of Equity or visit equity.usu.edu for information about supportive measures, reporting options, and the sexual misconduct grievance process.
What is Title IX?
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects people from sex discrimination at institutions that receive financial assistance from the federal government. Sexual misconduct – including sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence (dating and domestic violence), and stalking – is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title IX and by USU. The university is obligated to take prompt and effective steps to end sexual misconduct and sex discrimination when it occurs, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its effects.
What is sexual misconduct?
Sexual misconduct is a broad policy term that includes sexual harassment (quid pro quo and hostile environment), sexual assault, relationship violence, sexual exploitation, and sex-based stalking. Sexual misconduct is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by interim USU Policies 339 and 339A. The previous policies related to sexual misconduct are applicable to conduct alleged to have occurred August 14, 2020 or later per 34 CFRR 106 (2020). They are subject to change at any time.
A person of any sex can engage in sexual misconduct, and it can occur between people of the same or different sexes.
Using the term "sexual misconduct" serves to differentiate university policy processes, which are administrative and educational, from the criminal justice system, in which people are charged with crimes that carry criminal penalties.
How should sexual misconduct be reported?
Sexual misconduct that is committed by students, employees, and visitors to USU campuses violates interim USU Policies 339 and 339A and is not tolerated.
To report sexual misconduct, contact the USU Title IX Coordinator by reporting online at equity.usu.edu/report, calling 435-797-1266, emailing titleix@usu.edu, or visiting Distance Education room 400 on the Logan campus.
Sexual misconduct can also be reported to a Reporting Employee, who is required to report the information to the USU Title IX Coordinator. A list of Reporting Employees is available in interim USU policy 340.
Is there a time limit for making a sexual misconduct report to the USU Title IX Coordinator?
There is no time limit for making reports to the USU Title IX Coordinator, but reporting as soon as possible after an incident gives the University a better chance to respond promptly and effectively. After a significant amount of time passes, it may be difficult to gather evidence to determine whether a policy violation occurred.
What is the role of the USU Title IX Coordinator with respect to sexual misconduct?
The USU Title IX Coordinator is the person designated by USU to coordinate USU's efforts to implement and monitor compliance with the university's sexual misconduct policies and with federal Title IX law and regulations more generally.
As such, the Title IX Coordinator has three main roles:
Promptly responding to reports of alleged sexual misconduct
Coordinating effective implementation of supportive measures to individuals impacted by sexual misconduct
Following a prompt and equitable grievance process to address sexual misconduct
What options are available through the Office of Equity for an individual who experienced sexual misconduct?
An individual who has experienced sexual misconduct has options and can choose from the options that they believe are best for them:
An individual may receive supportive measures, even without filing a formal compliant.
An individual may also file a formal complaint, where they provide information about the sexual misconduct and agree that they want the university to move forward with an alternative resolution or a formal investigation.
During an alternative resolution, the parties mutually agree on the outcome that addresses the sexual misconduct raised in the formal complaint.
A formal investigation occurs when both parties are interviewed, provide evidence, and participate in a hearing for reports under interim USU Policy 339. If the individual who engaged in the behavior is found to have violated university policy, appropriate sanctions are instituted.
What are supportive measures?
Supportive measures are short-term, non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services that are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the University’s Employment or Education Program or Activity without unreasonably burdening the other party and include measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the University’s educational environment, and/or to deter Sexual Misconduct. They may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, mutual no-contact orders, employment modifications, or financial aid appeals.
An individual can access supportive measures even if they do not file a formal complaint or choose not to proceed with a formal investigation.
What is the difference between reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator and reporting to police? What standard of evidence is used in these processes?
The university’s formal investigation process, which is coordinated by the USU Office of Equity, is an administrative process that determines whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, a member of the campus community (student, staff, or faculty) has violated interim USU Policy 339 or 339A. The preponderance of the evidence standard means a policy violation is more likely than not to have occurred. If someone is found responsible for violating university policy, they may face administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, a warning, probation, suspension, or expulsion. The information about sexual misconduct that is reported may also result in campus offices participating in education and training.
A criminal process, which may be coordinated by USU Police or local law enforcement, determines whether a crime has occurred. If someone wishes to seek criminal penalties for sexual misconduct that is also a crime or other forms of assistance from law enforcement, they can report to the police. Criminal justice procedures use beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard of evidence, which is a higher standard of evidence than the standard used in USU’s grievance process.
Both processes may be pursued simultaneously.
What if the individual who experienced sexual misconduct wants to keep their information confidential?
The USU Title IX Coordinator will consider requests for confidentiality (meaning that an individual doesn’t want their name connected to the incident or report) or that no investigation or disciplinary action be pursued. These requests are evaluated in the context of the university’s responsibility to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment.
An individual has the option of not providing information to the Office of Equity and not pursuing an investigation. However, the Office of Equity will still conduct a safety assessment with the limited information available to ensure the safety of the campus community.
Confidential resources are available both on- and off-campus.
Does USU discipline students for drug and alcohol student code violations discovered when reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator?
No, if a student who experiences or witnesses an incident of sexual misconduct reports it to the USU Title IX Coordinator, they will not get in trouble for a student code violation related to the incident, such as underage drinking or having alcohol on campus.
The health and safety of our community is our primary concern, and we want to remove barriers to reporting sexual misconduct to USU's Title IX Coordinator. USU’s student code includes an amnesty provision to excuse students who report sexual misconduct from facing discipline for a student code violation involving drugs and alcohol.
What are the reporting obligations of USU staff, faculty, and other academic appointees?
Some university employees are designated as reporting employees, which means they must report all information they receive about sexual misconduct or incidents of sexual misconduct about which they have knowledge to the USU Title IX Coordinator at equity.usu.edu/report.
The university provides designated confidential resources - medical professionals and medical staff, professional counselors, non-professional counselors, and advocates - so individuals who have been impacted by sexual misconduct can have access to support services in a confidential setting.
Some university employees are designated as non-designated employees, which means they are not required to report information they receive about sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator, but are required to share information about resources and reporting to the Title IX Coordinator to individuals who disclose sexual misconduct to them.
Who does the Office of Equity share the initial report with?
The Office of Equity keeps the initial report private but may share some information with specific USU employees, including when it is necessary to assess the safety risk posed by an incident or to provide an individual with supportive measures.
For example, if there is an immediate safety risk to an individual or to campus, the USU Title IX Coordinator may share information with local police or USU Police, including so that USU Police may evaluate for a timely warning notice, in accordance with the federal Clery Act. Timely warnings are a way to let the USU community about certain crimes that have occurred on campus, but do not include information that would identify the individual who allegedly experienced the sexual misconduct.

Sexual Misconduct Resource Guide
The following resources are available to students and employees who have experienced sexual misconduct, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, sexual exploitation, and sex-based stalking.
Ensure Your Safety First
Find a place you feel safe from further harm.
If you are in immediate danger, then contact the police. Call 9-1-1 from a cell phone, 9-9-1-1 from a Logan campus phone, or 5-9-1-1 from an Eastern campus phone for emergency help.
Designated Confidential Resources
Designated confidential resources provide an individual who discloses information about sexual misconduct with information about support services and reporting options. Information shared with a designated confidential resource will not trigger university action.
Trained advocates are available through USU's Sexual Assault and Anti-Violence Information (SAAVI) office and through community agencies (see community resources below). Advocates will help you navigate your options, seek medical attention, get a sexual assault forensic exam, receive counseling, file a police report, or report to the university.
Find Confidential Counseling
USU's Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides confidential mental health services and same-day crisis appointments to students.
USU's Mind-Body Bridging Clinic provides individual therapeutic sessions focused on Mind-Body Bridging, a practice that helps build self- and emotional-regulation skills and enhance overall mental health. This clinic is available to both students and employees via self-referral or through CAPS or SAAVI referral.
Get Medical Attention
If you experienced a sexual assault or relationship violence, a medical professional can treat injuries, even those you may not be able to see, including sexually transmitted infections. Consider seeing a medical professional right away to take care of your health.
Students in Logan
USU Student Health Center to schedule an appointment
Students at USU Eastern
USU Eastern Health Services to schedule an appointment.
Statewide
Students at other statewide campuses and USU employees should visit a local health care provider.
Preserve Evidence
After a sexual assault, DNA evidence can be collected from your body, clothing, and other personal belongings. A sexual assault forensic exam, or SAFE exam, ensures you receive important medical attention and can preserve possible DNA evidence. A forensic exam is ideal within 72 hours after the assault.
To preserve evidence, try not to bathe, shower, use the restroom, change your clothes, comb your hair, or clean up. If you receive a sexual assault forensic exam, certain information must be given to police according to Utah law, but you are not required to pursue a police investigation. You will also be provided with treatment for injuries.
Logan
If you are a Logan campus student or employee, go directly to Cache Valley Hospital to receive care from a certified Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner.
Statewide
If you are not a Logan campus student or employee, review the Community Resources map below to learn where you can get a sexual assault forensic exam.
Request Supportive Measures
Whether or not you want to pursue the Office of Equity grievance process, you may receive supportive measures, such as academic accommodations or changes to on-campus housing, class, or work schedules.
Report to USU Title IX Coordinator
Any USU student or employee may report sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Equity. Reports can be filed online at equity.usu.edu/report.
Title IX Coordinator: Cody Carmichaelcody.carmichael@usu.edu | 435-797-1266Office of Equity, Distance Education 400, USU Logan campus
USU offers amnesty for drug and alcohol policy violations of the Student Code when a student reports an incident of sexual misconduct, whether they experienced or witnessed it. For example, if you experience or witness sexual assault and report it to the Title IX Coordinator, you will not get in trouble for a student code violation such as underage drinking or having alcohol on campus. Students who participate as a witness in a sexual misconduct grievance process are also granted amnesty, though they may be encouraged to participate in health education.
Report to Law Enforcement
Sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking can be reported to the local law enforcement agency that serves the area where the incident took place. If you need help identifying the appropriate law enforcement agency, contact USU Police at 435-797-1939.
USU's Office of Equity or SAAVI can assist an individual with filing a report with USUPD or local law enforcement. Also, the Office of Equity can provide supportive measures, including accommodations such as adjusted deadlines and excused absences, to accommodate participating in the criminal process.
If an incident occurred on the Logan, Eastern, or Blanding campuses, you may report to university police (below). USU Police forward all reports of sexual misconduct to USU's Title IX Coordinator. You can pursue a police investigation and the university's grievance process at the same time.
The following law enforcement agencies serve the communities where our residential campuses are located.

Sexual Misconduct Policy Terms
The university prohibits employees, students, and third parties from engaging in relationship violence, sex-based stalking, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, and sexual harassment (collectively referred to herein as “sexual msconduct”). The university will take swift action to address sexual misconduct when the university has actual knowledge that it has occurred.
Sexual Misconduct is referred to as "sexual harassment" in 34 C.F.R. § 106.30 (2020). Sexual misconduct is conduct on the basis of sex including one or more of the following types of conduct:
Relationship violence;
Sex-based stalking;
Sexual assault;
Sexual exploitation; and
Sexual harassment.
Protected speech alone does not constitute sexual harassment; rather, a course of conduct must include something beyond mere expression of views, words, symbols or thoughts that a person finds offensive to be sexual harassment. To be considered sexual harassment, a course of conduct must be considered sufficiently serious that it effectively denies a person equal access to an employment or education program or activity, which is evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person in the claimant’s position, considering all the circumstances, including the claimant’s age.
Visit interim USU Policies 339 and 339A and USU Policy 533 for more information about sexual misconduct. Policies 339 and 339A related to sexual misconduct are applicable to conduct alleged to have occurred August 14, 2020 or later per 34 C.F.R. 106 (2020). They are subject to change at any time.
Sexual Misconduct Definitions
Relationship Violence
Relationship violence includes dating violence and domestic violence.
Dating Violence
Dating violence includes violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the claimant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (a) the length of the relationship, (b) the nature of the relationship, and (c) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
Domestic Violence
Domestic violence includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed against the claimant by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the claimant, by a person with whom the claimant shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the claimant as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the claimant under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred, or by any other person against an adult or youth claimant who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction. A criminal charge or conviction is not a predicate for an allegation of domestic violence to be brought under this policy.
Potential Examples of Relationship Violence
Physical violence - hitting, slapping, punching
Sexual assault
Coercion and threats - threats to hurt, kill, die by suicide, end the relationship, report someone to authorities
Intimidation - threatening looks, actions, gestures; destroying property; abusing pets; displaying weapons; stalking
Sex-based Stalking
Sex-based stalking is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person or persons based on sex, that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or for the safety of others or to suffer substantial emotional distress. Stalking may occur in person, by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, device, or method.
A course of conduct is two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through a third party, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, intimidates, harasses, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, method, device, or means.
Potential Examples of Sex-based Stalking

Repeated and unwanted contact on social media
Following or spying
Showing up somewhere without a legitimate reason to be there
Contacting friends, family, work, etc. for information about someone
Posting information or spreading rumors online or by word of mouth
Using technology to track someone's movements or whereabouts

Monitoring phone calls, emails, social media, etc.
Sexual Assault
Sexual Assault includes any sexual act or attempted sexual act, including rape, sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or fondling, directed against another person without their consent. This includes instances where the person is incapable of giving consent because of their age or incapacitation. Sexual assault also includes unlawful sexual acts, such as incest and statutory rape.
Rape
Rape is sexual intercourse with another person without their consent.
Sodomy
Sodomy is oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person without their consent.
Sexual Assault with An Object
Sexual Assault with An Object is the use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person without their consent.
Fondling
Fondling is the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification without their consent.
Incest
Incest is sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law (e.g., a sibling or parent/child relationship).
Statutory Rape
Statutory Rape is sexual intercourse with a person who is under Utah’s statutory age of consent.
Potential Examples of Sexual Assault
Guilting someone into sexual activity
Changing the sexual activity without the other person’s consent
Engaging in sexual activity when someone is incapacitated or unconscious
Engaging in sexual activity when someone hasn’t affirmatively consented, even if they didn’t say no
Using threats to force someone into sexual activity
Using power or influence to coerce someone into sexual activity
Sexual Exploitation
Sexual Exploitation is taking non-consensual sexual advantage of another for one’s own advantage or benefit, or to the benefit or advantage anyone other than the claimant. Examples include, but are not limited to:
Observing, recording, or photographing nudity or sexual activity of one or more persons without their consent in a location where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy;
Allowing another to observe, record, or photograph nudity or sexual activity of one or more persons without their consent where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy; or
Distributing recordings, photographs, or other images of the nudity or sexual activity of one or more persons without their consent.
Sexual Harassment
Sexual Harassment includes hostile environment and quid pro quo.
Hostile Environment
Hostile Environment is unwelcome sex-based conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to an employment or education program or activity.
Quid Pro Quo
Quid Pro Quo is an employee’s conditioning the provision of a university aid, benefit, or service on a person’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct.
Potential Examples of Sexual Harassment
Unwelcome and repeated sexual comments, references, or jokes
Asking unwelcome personal questions about someone's body or intimate relationships
Unwelcome talking about someone's sex life
Repeatedly asking someone out when the answer is "no"
Unwelcome and repeated references to someone as hunk, doll, babe, honey, etc.
Unwelcome and repeated catcalling or whistling
Sending repeated and unwelcome sexual language or images through technology (text, email, social media)
Unwelcome and repeated sexual gestures with hands or body movements
Unwelcome and repeated looking at a person up and down (elevator eyes)

Unwelcome and repeated massaging of a person's neck, shoulders, etc.
Unwelcome and repeated hugging, kissing, patting, or stroking of someone
Unwelcome and repeated touching or rubbing oneself sexually in view of others
Consent Definition
Consent is an affirmative agreement to do the same thing at the same time in the same way. An affirmative agreement includes an informed, freely and actively given, mutually understandable exchange of unmistakable words or actions, which indicate an affirmative willingness to participate in mutually agreed upon sexual activity. Consent can be withdrawn or modified at any time, as long as such withdrawal or modification is clearly communicated.
Consent cannot be assumed based on silence, the absence of “no” or “stop,” the existence of a prior or current relationship, or prior sexual activity. There is no consent when there is force, coercion, or incapacitation.
Examples of Consensual Behavior
May include, but are not limited to:
Verbal statements of “yes” or “okay”
Head nodding
Asking someone to engage in the sexual activity
Examples of Non-Consensual Behavior
May include, but are not limited to:
Verbal statements of “no” or “I don’t want to”
Verbal statements of “I don’t know” or “maybe”
Pushing someone away
Resisting contact
Shrugging or other uncertain body language
Not actively participating in the sexual activity
No response or silence
Disengaging from previous consensual behavior
Force, coercion, or incapacitation
Coercion, Incapacitation, and Force Definitions
Coercion
Coercion may consist of intimidation, threats, or other severe conduct that causes a reasonable person to fear significant consequences if they refuse to engage in sexual contact.
Incapacitation
Incapacitation is a state in which a person lacks the ability, temporarily or permanently, to give consent to sexual activity including because of a disability, drug or alcohol consumption (whether voluntary or involuntary), or because the person is unconscious, asleep, immobilized, or otherwise unaware that the sexual activity is occurring. A person is not necessarily incapacitated solely as a result of drinking or using drugs; the level of impairment must be significant enough to render the person unable to give consent.
It is not an excuse that the party initiating sexual contact was intoxicated and therefore did not realize the other person’s incapacity. In evaluating cases involving alleged Incapacitation, the university considers whether the person initiating the sexual conduct knew or should have known the other person was incapacitated.
Force
Force includes the use of physical force or threats of force that affects a person's ability to give consent to sexual contact.
Retaliation Definition
Retaliation is taking adverse action, including any action that might deter a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity, because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, participated, or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, formal or informal proceeding, or other procedure under policies 340, 339, 339A, or 305. A causal relationship between an adverse action and good faith reporting or participation under this Policy (policy 305) is needed to demonstrate that retaliation has occurred.
Potential Examples of Retaliation
Adverse employment or educational action - demoting, terminating, firing; denying a promotion or leave; making adverse pay decisions; giving a lower grade or performance review than deserved; dismissing someone from a class, program, team, workspace, etc.
Intimidating, threatening, or harassing actions - threatening dismissal from a program or expulsion from the university; threatening to disclose confidential information or report an individual to authorities (e.g., immigration authorities); making intentionally false or misleading statements that would dissuade a reasonable person from making a complaint of Sexual Misconduct

Sexual Harassment
Sexual Harassment includes hostile environment and quid pro quo.
Hostile Environment
Hostile Environment is unwelcome sex-based conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to an employment or education program or activity.
Quid Pro Quo
Quid Pro Quo is an employee’s conditioning the provision of a university aid, benefit, or service on a person’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct.
Potential Examples of Sexual Harassment
Unwelcome and repeated sexual comments, references, or jokes
Asking unwelcome personal questions about someone's body or intimate relationships
Unwelcome talking about someone's sex life
Repeatedly asking someone out when the answer is "no"
Unwelcome and repeated references to someone as hunk, doll, babe, honey, etc.
Unwelcome and repeated catcalling or whistling
Sending repeated and unwelcome sexual language or images through technology (text, email, social media)
Unwelcome and repeated sexual gestures with hands or body movements
Unwelcome and repeated looking at a person up and down (elevator eyes)
Paying unwanted sexual attention to someone
Displaying unwelcome sexually suggestive visuals
Suggestively making unwelcome facial expressions (winking, licking lips, etc.)
Unwelcome and repeated hanging around, standing too close, or brushing up against someone
Unwelcome and repeated touching of a person's clothing, hair, etc.
Unwelcome and repeated massaging of a person's neck, shoulders, etc.
Unwelcome and repeated hugging, kissing, patting, or stroking of someone
Unwelcome and repeated touching or rubbing oneself sexually in view of others
Consent Definition
Consent is an affirmative agreement to do the same thing at the same time in the same way. An affirmative agreement includes an informed, freely and actively given, mutually understandable exchange of unmistakable words or actions, which indicate an affirmative willingness to participate in mutually agreed upon sexual activity. Consent can be withdrawn or modified at any time, as long as such withdrawal or modification is clearly communicated.
Consent cannot be assumed based on silence, the absence of “no” or “stop,” the existence of a prior or current relationship, or prior sexual activity. There is no consent when there is force, coercion, or incapacitation.
Examples of Consensual Behavior
May include, but are not limited to:
Verbal statements of “yes” or “okay”
Head nodding
Asking someone to engage in the sexual activity
Examples of Non-Consensual Behavior
May include, but are not limited to:
Verbal statements of “no” or “I don’t want to”
Verbal statements of “I don’t know” or “maybe”
Pushing someone away
Resisting contact
Shrugging or other uncertain body language
Not actively participating in the sexual activity
No response or silence
Disengaging from previous consensual behavior
Force, coercion, or incapacitation
Coercion, Incapacitation, and Force Definitions
Coercion
Coercion may consist of intimidation, threats, or other severe conduct that causes a reasonable person to fear significant consequences if they refuse to engage in sexual contact.
Incapacitation
Incapacitation is a state in which a person lacks the ability, temporarily or permanently, to give consent to sexual activity including because of a disability, drug or alcohol consumption (whether voluntary or involuntary), or because the person is unconscious, asleep, immobilized, or otherwise unaware that the sexual activity is occurring. A person is not necessarily incapacitated solely as a result of drinking or using drugs; the level of impairment must be significant enough to render the person unable to give consent.
It is not an excuse that the party initiating sexual contact was intoxicated and therefore did not realize the other person’s incapacity. In evaluating cases involving alleged Incapacitation, the university considers whether the person initiating the sexual conduct knew or should have known the other person was incapacitated.
Force
Force includes the use of physical force or threats of force that affects a person's ability to give consent to sexual contact.
Retaliation Definition
Retaliation is taking adverse action, including any action that might deter a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity, because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, participated, or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, formal or informal proceeding, or other procedure under policies 340, 339, 339A, or 305. A causal relationship between an adverse action and good faith reporting or participation under this Policy (policy 305) is needed to demonstrate that retaliation has occurred.
Potential Examples of Retaliation
Adverse employment or educational action - demoting, terminating, firing; denying a promotion or leave; making adverse pay decisions; giving a lower grade or performance review than deserved; dismissing someone from a class, program, team, workspace, etc.
Intimidating, threatening, or harassing actions - threatening dismissal from a program or expulsion from the university; threatening to disclose confidential information or report an individual to authorities (e.g., immigration authorities); making intentionally false or misleading statements that would dissuade a reasonable person from making a complaint of Sexual Misconduct

Sexual Misconduct Resource Guide
The following resources are available to students and employees who have experienced sexual misconduct, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, sexual exploitation, and sex-based stalking.
Ensure Your Safety First
Find a place you feel safe from further harm.
If you are in immediate danger, then contact the police. Call 9-1-1 from a cell phone, 9-9-1-1 from a Logan campus phone, or 5-9-1-1 from an Eastern campus phone for emergency help.
Designated Confidential Resources
Designated confidential resources provide an individual who discloses information about sexual misconduct with information about support services and reporting options. Information shared with a designated confidential resource will not trigger university action.
Trained advocates are available through USU's Sexual Assault and Anti-Violence Information (SAAVI) office and through community agencies (see community resources below). Advocates will help you navigate your options, seek medical attention, get a sexual assault forensic exam, receive counseling, file a police report, or report to the university.
Find Confidential Counseling
USU's Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides confidential mental health services and same-day crisis appointments to students.
USU's Mind-Body Bridging Clinic provides individual therapeutic sessions focused on Mind-Body Bridging, a practice that helps build self- and emotional-regulation skills and enhance overall mental health. This clinic is available to both students and employees via self-referral or through CAPS or SAAVI referral.
Get Medical Attention
If you experienced a sexual assault or relationship violence, a medical professional can treat injuries, even those you may not be able to see, including sexually transmitted infections. Consider seeing a medical professional right away to take care of your health.
Students in Logan
USU Student Health Center to schedule an appointment
Students at USU Eastern
USU Eastern Health Services to schedule an appointment.
Statewide
Students at other statewide campuses and USU employees should visit a local health care provider.
Preserve Evidence
After a sexual assault, DNA evidence can be collected from your body, clothing, and other personal belongings. A sexual assault forensic exam, or SAFE exam, ensures you receive important medical attention and can preserve possible DNA evidence. A forensic exam is ideal within 72 hours after the assault.
To preserve evidence, try not to bathe, shower, use the restroom, change your clothes, comb your hair, or clean up. If you receive a sexual assault forensic exam, certain information must be given to police according to Utah law, but you are not required to pursue a police investigation. You will also be provided with treatment for injuries.
Logan
If you are a Logan campus student or employee, go directly to Cache Valley Hospital to receive care from a certified Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner.
Statewide
If you are not a Logan campus student or employee, review the Community Resources map below to learn where you can get a sexual assault forensic exam.
Request Supportive Measures
Whether or not you want to pursue the Office of Equity grievance process, you may receive supportive measures, such as academic accommodations or changes to on-campus housing, class, or work schedules.
Report to USU Title IX Coordinator
Any USU student or employee may report sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Equity. Reports can be filed online at equity.usu.edu/report.
Title IX Coordinator: Cody Carmichaelcody.carmichael@usu.edu | 435-797-1266Office of Equity, Distance Education 400, USU Logan campus
USU offers amnesty for drug and alcohol policy violations of the Student Code when a student reports an incident of sexual misconduct, whether they experienced or witnessed it. For example, if you experience or witness sexual assault and report it to the Title IX Coordinator, you will not get in trouble for a student code violation such as underage drinking or having alcohol on campus. Students who participate as a witness in a sexual misconduct grievance process are also granted amnesty, though they may be encouraged to participate in health education.
Report to Law Enforcement
Sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking can be reported to the local law enforcement agency that serves the area where the incident took place. If you need help identifying the appropriate law enforcement agency, contact USU Police at 435-797-1939.
USU's Office of Equity or SAAVI can assist an individual with filing a report with USUPD or local law enforcement. Also, the Office of Equity can provide supportive measures, including accommodations such as adjusted deadlines and excused absences, to accommodate participating in the criminal process.
If an incident occurred on the Logan, Eastern, or Blanding campuses, you may report to university police (below). USU Police forward all reports of sexual misconduct to USU's Title IX Coordinator. You can pursue a police investigation and the university's grievance process at the same time.
The following law enforcement agencies serve the communities where our residential campuses are located.
