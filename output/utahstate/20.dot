See interim USU Policy 339.\nIn compliance with Title IX, the Office of Equity works to create a learning and working environment free from sex discrimination and sexual misconduct through its prevention efforts and by providing a grievance process and offering support and resources to those who have been impacted by sexual misconduct. You can contact the Office of Equity or visit equity.usu.edu for information about supportive measures, reporting options, and the sexual misconduct grievance process.\nWhat is Title IX?\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects people from sex discrimination at institutions that receive financial assistance from the federal government. Sexual misconduct \xe2\x80\x93 including sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence (dating and domestic violence), and stalking \xe2\x80\x93 is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title IX and by USU. The university is obligated to take prompt and effective steps to end sexual misconduct and sex discrimination when it occurs, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its effects.\nWhat is sexual misconduct?\nSexual misconduct is a broad policy term that includes sexual harassment (quid pro quo and hostile environment), sexual assault, relationship violence, sexual exploitation, and sex-based stalking. Sexual misconduct is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by interim USU Policies 339 and 339A. The previous policies related to sexual misconduct are applicable to conduct alleged to have occurred August 14, 2020 or later per 34 CFRR 106 (2020). They are subject to change at any time.\nA person of any sex can engage in sexual misconduct, and it can occur between people of the same or different sexes.\nUsing the term \"sexual misconduct\"\xc2\xa0serves to differentiate\xc2\xa0university policy processes, which are administrative and educational, from the criminal justice system, in which people are charged with crimes that carry criminal penalties.\nHow should sexual misconduct be reported?\nSexual misconduct that is committed by students, employees, and visitors to USU campuses violates interim USU Policies 339 and 339A and is not tolerated.\nTo report sexual misconduct, contact the USU Title IX Coordinator by reporting online at equity.usu.edu/report, calling 435-797-1266, emailing titleix@usu.edu, or visiting Distance Education room 400 on the Logan campus.\nSexual misconduct can also be reported to a Reporting Employee, who is required to report the information to the USU Title IX Coordinator. A list of Reporting Employees is available in interim USU policy 340.\nIs there a time limit for making a sexual misconduct report to the USU Title IX Coordinator?\nThere is no time limit for making reports to the USU Title IX Coordinator, but reporting as soon as possible after an incident gives the University a better chance to respond promptly and effectively. After a significant amount of time passes, it may be difficult to gather evidence to determine whether a policy violation occurred.\nWhat is the role of the USU Title IX Coordinator with respect to sexual misconduct?\nThe USU Title IX Coordinator is the person designated by USU to coordinate USU\'s efforts to implement and monitor compliance with the university\'s sexual misconduct policies and with federal Title IX law and regulations more generally.\nAs such, the Title IX Coordinator has three main roles:\nPromptly responding to reports of alleged sexual misconduct\nCoordinating effective implementation of supportive measures to individuals impacted by sexual misconduct\nFollowing a prompt and equitable grievance process to address sexual misconduct\nWhat options are available through the Office of Equity for an individual who experienced sexual misconduct?\nAn individual who has experienced sexual misconduct has options and can choose from the options that they believe are best for them:\nAn individual may receive supportive measures, even without filing a formal compliant.\nAn individual may also file a formal complaint, where they provide information about the sexual misconduct and agree that they want the university to move forward with an alternative resolution or a formal investigation.\nDuring an alternative resolution, the parties mutually agree on the outcome that addresses the sexual misconduct raised in the formal complaint.\nA formal investigation occurs when both parties are interviewed, provide evidence, and participate in a hearing for reports under interim USU Policy\xc2\xa0339. If the individual who engaged in the behavior is found to have violated university policy, appropriate sanctions are instituted.\nWhat are supportive measures?\nSupportive measures are short-term, non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services that are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the University\xe2\x80\x99s Employment or Education Program or Activity without unreasonably burdening the other party and include measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the University\xe2\x80\x99s educational environment, and/or to deter Sexual Misconduct. They may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, mutual no-contact orders, employment modifications, or financial aid appeals.\nAn individual can access supportive measures even if they do not file a formal complaint or choose not to proceed with a formal investigation.\nWhat is the difference between reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator and reporting to police? What standard of evidence is used in these processes?\nThe university\xe2\x80\x99s formal investigation process, which is coordinated by the USU Office of Equity, is an administrative process that determines whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, a member of the campus community (student, staff, or faculty) has violated interim USU Policy 339 or 339A. The preponderance of the evidence standard means a policy violation is more likely than not to have occurred. If someone is found responsible for violating university policy, they may face administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, a warning, probation, suspension, or expulsion. The information about sexual misconduct that is reported may also result in campus offices participating in education and training.\nA criminal process, which may be coordinated by USU Police or local law enforcement, determines whether a crime has occurred. If someone wishes to seek criminal penalties for sexual misconduct that is also a crime or other forms of assistance from law enforcement, they can report to the police. Criminal justice procedures use beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard of evidence, which is a higher standard of evidence than the standard used in USU\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process.\nBoth processes may be pursued simultaneously.\nWhat if the individual who experienced sexual misconduct wants to keep their information confidential?\nThe USU Title IX Coordinator will consider requests for confidentiality (meaning that an individual doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want their name connected to the incident or report) or that no investigation or disciplinary action be pursued. These requests are evaluated in the context of the university\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment.\nAn individual has the option of not providing information to the Office of Equity and not pursuing an investigation. However, the Office of Equity will still conduct a safety assessment with the limited information available to ensure the safety of the campus community.\nConfidential resources are available both on- and off-campus.\nDoes USU discipline students for drug and alcohol student code violations discovered when reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator?\nNo, if a student who experiences or witnesses an incident of sexual misconduct reports it to the USU Title IX Coordinator, they will not get in trouble for a student code violation related to the incident, such as underage drinking or having alcohol on campus.\nThe health and safety of our community is our primary concern, and we want to remove barriers to reporting sexual misconduct to USU\'s Title IX Coordinator. USU\xe2\x80\x99s student code includes an amnesty provision to excuse students who report sexual misconduct from facing discipline for a student code violation involving drugs and alcohol.\nWhat are the reporting obligations of USU staff, faculty, and other academic appointees?\nSome university employees are designated as reporting employees, which means they must report all information they receive about sexual misconduct or incidents of sexual misconduct about which they have knowledge to the USU Title IX Coordinator at equity.usu.edu/report.\nThe university provides designated confidential resources - medical professionals and medical staff, professional counselors, non-professional counselors, and advocates - so individuals who have been impacted by sexual misconduct can have access to support services in a confidential setting.\nSome university employees are designated as non-designated employees, which means they are not required to report information they receive about sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator, but are required to share information about resources and reporting to the Title IX Coordinator to individuals who disclose sexual misconduct to them.\nWho does the Office of Equity share the initial report with?\nThe Office of Equity keeps the initial report private but may share some information with specific USU employees, including when it is necessary to assess the safety risk posed by an incident or to provide an individual with supportive measures.\nFor example, if there is an immediate safety risk to an individual or to campus, the\xc2\xa0USU Title IX Coordinator\xc2\xa0may share information with local police\xc2\xa0or USU Police, including so that USU Police may evaluate for a\xc2\xa0timely warning notice, in accordance with the federal Clery Act. Timely warnings are a way to let the USU community\xc2\xa0about certain crimes that have occurred\xc2\xa0on campus, but do not include information that would identify the individual who allegedly experienced the sexual misconduct.\nOn This Page\nWhat is Title IX?\nWhat is sexual misconduct?\nHow should sexual misconduct be reported?\nIs there a time limit for making a sexual misconduct report to the USU Title IX Coordinator?\nWhat is the role of the USU Title IX Coordinator with respect to sexual misconduct?\nWhat options are available through the Office of Equity for an individual who experienced sexual misconduct?\nWhat are supportive measures?\nWhat is the difference between reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator and reporting to police?\nWhat if the individual who experienced sexual misconduct wants to keep their information confidential?\nDoes USU discipline students for drug and alcohol student code violations discovered when reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator?\nWhat are the reporting obligations of USU staff, faculty, and other academic appointees?\nWho does the Office of Equity share the initial report with?\nOffice of Equity\nCONTACT US\nGeneral questions:titleix@usu.eduTraining/online course questions:prevention@usu.eduPhone: (435) 797-1266FAX: (435) 797-0291\nLOCATION\nOffice of EquityDistance Education 400, UMC 5100Utah State UniversityLogan, UT 84322-5100 USA\nRESOURCES\nSAAVI Only\nSexual Misconduct Resource Guide\nMaps & Directions\nSearch USU\nCampus Safety\nJobs\nContact\nTerms of Use\nCopyright\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nNon-Discrimination\nAdmin\nBack to top of the page'"];

The university will take swift action to address sexual misconduct when the university has actual knowledge that it has occurred.\nSexual Misconduct\xc2\xa0is referred to as \"sexual harassment\" in 34 C.F.R. \xc2\xa7 106.30\xc2\xa0(2020). Sexual misconduct is conduct on the basis of sex including one or more of the following types of conduct:\nRelationship violence;\nSex-based stalking;\nSexual assault;\nSexual exploitation; and\nSexual harassment.\nProtected speech alone does not constitute sexual harassment; rather, a course of conduct must include something beyond mere expression of views, words, symbols or thoughts that a person finds offensive to be sexual harassment. To be considered sexual harassment, a course of conduct must be considered sufficiently serious that it effectively denies a person equal access to an employment or education program or activity, which is evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person in the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s position, considering all the circumstances, including the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s age.\nVisit interim USU Policies 339 and 339A\xc2\xa0and USU Policy 533 for more information about sexual misconduct. Policies 339 and 339A related to sexual misconduct are applicable to conduct alleged to have occurred August 14, 2020 or later per 34 C.F.R. 106 (2020). They are subject to change at any time.\nSexual Misconduct Definitions\nRelationship Violence\nRelationship violence includes dating violence and domestic violence.\nDating Violence\nDating violence includes violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the claimant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: (a) the length of the relationship, (b) the nature of the relationship, and (c) the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\nDomestic Violence\nDomestic violence includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed against the claimant by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the claimant, by a person with whom the claimant shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the claimant as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the claimant under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred, or by any other person against an adult or youth claimant who is protected from that person\xe2\x80\x99s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction. A criminal charge or conviction is not a predicate for an allegation of domestic violence to be brought under this policy.\nPotential Examples of Relationship Violence\nPhysical violence - hitting, slapping, punching\nSexual assault\nCoercion and threats - threats to hurt, kill, die by suicide, end the relationship, report someone to authorities\nIntimidation - threatening looks, actions, gestures; destroying property; abusing pets; displaying weapons; stalking\nSex-based Stalking\nSex-based stalking is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person or persons based on sex, that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or for the safety of others or to suffer substantial emotional distress. Stalking may occur in person, by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, device, or method.\nA course of conduct is two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through a third party, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, intimidates, harasses, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person\xe2\x80\x99s property by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, method, device, or means.\nPotential Examples of Sex-based Stalking\nRepeated and unwanted phone calls or texts\nRepeated and unwanted contact on social media\nFollowing or spying\nShowing up somewhere without a legitimate reason to be there\nContacting friends, family, work, etc. for information about someone\nPosting information or spreading rumors online or by word of mouth\nUsing technology to track someone\'s movements or whereabouts\nCollecting information about patterns, job, classes, friends, etc.\nMonitoring phone calls, emails, social media, etc.\nSexual Assault\nSexual Assault includes any sexual act or attempted sexual act, including rape, sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or fondling, directed against another person without their consent.

An affirmative agreement includes an informed, freely and actively given, mutually understandable exchange of unmistakable words or actions, which indicate an affirmative willingness to participate in mutually agreed upon sexual activity. Consent can be withdrawn or modified at any time, as long as such withdrawal or modification is clearly communicated.\nConsent cannot be assumed based on silence, the absence of \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstop,\xe2\x80\x9d the existence of a prior or current relationship, or prior sexual activity.

A person is not necessarily incapacitated solely as a result of drinking or using drugs; the level of impairment must be significant enough to render the person unable to give consent.\nIt is not an excuse that the party initiating sexual contact was intoxicated and therefore did not realize the other person\xe2\x80\x99s incapacity. In evaluating cases involving alleged Incapacitation, the university considers whether the person initiating the sexual conduct knew or should have known the other person was incapacitated.\nForce\nForce includes the use of physical force or threats of force that affects a person\'s ability to give consent to sexual contact.\nRetaliation Definition\nRetaliation is taking adverse action, including any action that might deter a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity, because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, participated, or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, formal or informal proceeding, or other procedure under policies 340, 339, 339A, or 305. A causal relationship between an adverse action and good faith reporting or participation under this Policy (policy 305) is needed to demonstrate that retaliation has occurred.\nPotential Examples of Retaliation\nAdverse employment or educational action - demoting, terminating, firing; denying a promotion or leave; making adverse pay decisions; giving a lower grade or performance review than deserved; dismissing someone from a class, program, team, workspace, etc.\nIntimidating, threatening, or harassing actions - threatening dismissal from a program or expulsion from the university; threatening to disclose confidential information or report an individual to authorities (e.g., immigration authorities); making intentionally false or misleading statements that would dissuade a reasonable person from making a complaint of Sexual Misconduct\nOffice of Equity\nCONTACT US\nGeneral questions:titleix@usu.eduTraining/online course questions:prevention@usu.eduPhone: (435) 797-1266FAX: (435) 797-0291\nLOCATION\nOffice of EquityDistance Education 400, UMC 5100Utah State UniversityLogan, UT 84322-5100 USA\nRESOURCES\nSAAVI Only\nSexual Misconduct Resource Guide\nMaps & Directions\nSearch USU\nCampus Safety\nJobs\nContact\nTerms of Use\nCopyright\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nNon-Discrimination\nAdmin\nBack to top of the page'"];

A sexual assault forensic exam, or SAFE exam, ensures you receive important medical attention and can preserve possible DNA evidence.

Under the law, sex-based discrimination is defined as someone being excluded from participation in, being denied the benefits of, or being subjected to discrimination on the basis of their sex assigned at birth. USU policy 305 additionally prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.\nSex-based discrimination also includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, sexual exploitation, and sex-based stalking. These specific behaviors prohibited by Title IX are collectively called \xe2\x80\x9csexual misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d in interim USU policies 339 and 339A.\nTitle IX applies to all individuals participating in educational programs or activities that are affiliated with USU, which includes students who experience sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) during an out of classroom learning experience (internship, practicum, student teaching, field work, research process, etc.).\nTo report sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) to USU, visit equity.usu.edu/report or contact USU\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator\xc2\xa0at 435-797-1266, titleix@usu.edu, or in Distance Education 400 on the USU Logan campus.\nInformation for USU Students, USU Faculty/Staff advisors and coordinators, and Placement Site Supervisors\nUSU Students\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) in an out of classroom learning experience, below are some actions you can take. Remember, it is normal to be afraid or worried about reporting sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) or taking other actions to make the behaviors stop. Do what is right for you.\nWhile USU may not have control over the person engaging in the sex-based discrimination in an out of classroom learning experience, the university can help remove you from the out of classroom learning experience and offer support and access to resources to you.\nReport to USU\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator: Students can report sex-based discrimination (including sexual misconduct) at equity.usu.edu/report or by contacting USU\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator at 435-797-1266, titleix@usu.edu, or in Distance Education room 400 on the USU Logan campus.

See interim USU Policy 339.\nIn compliance with Title IX, the Office of Equity works to create a learning and working environment free from sex discrimination and sexual misconduct through its prevention efforts and by providing a grievance process and offering support and resources to those who have been impacted by sexual misconduct. You can contact the Office of Equity or visit equity.usu.edu for information about supportive measures, reporting options, and the sexual misconduct grievance process.\nWhat is Title IX?\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects people from sex discrimination at institutions that receive financial assistance from the federal government. Sexual misconduct \xe2\x80\x93 including sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence (dating and domestic violence), and stalking \xe2\x80\x93 is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title IX and by USU. The university is obligated to take prompt and effective steps to end sexual misconduct and sex discrimination when it occurs, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its effects.\nWhat is sexual misconduct?\nSexual misconduct is a broad policy term that includes sexual harassment (quid pro quo and hostile environment), sexual assault, relationship violence, sexual exploitation, and sex-based stalking. Sexual misconduct is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by interim USU Policies 339 and 339A. The previous policies related to sexual misconduct are applicable to conduct alleged to have occurred August 14, 2020 or later per 34 CFRR 106 (2020). They are subject to change at any time.\nA person of any sex can engage in sexual misconduct, and it can occur between people of the same or different sexes.\nUsing the term \"sexual misconduct\"\xc2\xa0serves to differentiate\xc2\xa0university policy processes, which are administrative and educational, from the criminal justice system, in which people are charged with crimes that carry criminal penalties.\nHow should sexual misconduct be reported?\nSexual misconduct that is committed by students, employees, and visitors to USU campuses violates interim USU Policies 339 and 339A and is not tolerated.\nTo report sexual misconduct, contact the USU Title IX Coordinator by reporting online at equity.usu.edu/report, calling 435-797-1266, emailing titleix@usu.edu, or visiting Distance Education room 400 on the Logan campus.\nSexual misconduct can also be reported to a Reporting Employee, who is required to report the information to the USU Title IX Coordinator. A list of Reporting Employees is available in interim USU policy 340.\nIs there a time limit for making a sexual misconduct report to the USU Title IX Coordinator?\nThere is no time limit for making reports to the USU Title IX Coordinator, but reporting as soon as possible after an incident gives the University a better chance to respond promptly and effectively. After a significant amount of time passes, it may be difficult to gather evidence to determine whether a policy violation occurred.\nWhat is the role of the USU Title IX Coordinator with respect to sexual misconduct?\nThe USU Title IX Coordinator is the person designated by USU to coordinate USU\'s efforts to implement and monitor compliance with the university\'s sexual misconduct policies and with federal Title IX law and regulations more generally.\nAs such, the Title IX Coordinator has three main roles:\nPromptly responding to reports of alleged sexual misconduct\nCoordinating effective implementation of supportive measures to individuals impacted by sexual misconduct\nFollowing a prompt and equitable grievance process to address sexual misconduct\nWhat options are available through the Office of Equity for an individual who experienced sexual misconduct?\nAn individual who has experienced sexual misconduct has options and can choose from the options that they believe are best for them:\nAn individual may receive supportive measures, even without filing a formal compliant.\nAn individual may also file a formal complaint, where they provide information about the sexual misconduct and agree that they want the university to move forward with an alternative resolution or a formal investigation.\nDuring an alternative resolution, the parties mutually agree on the outcome that addresses the sexual misconduct raised in the formal complaint.\nA formal investigation occurs when both parties are interviewed, provide evidence, and participate in a hearing for reports under interim USU Policy\xc2\xa0339. If the individual who engaged in the behavior is found to have violated university policy, appropriate sanctions are instituted.\nWhat are supportive measures?\nSupportive measures are short-term, non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services that are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the University\xe2\x80\x99s Employment or Education Program or Activity without unreasonably burdening the other party and include measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the University\xe2\x80\x99s educational environment, and/or to deter Sexual Misconduct. They may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, mutual no-contact orders, employment modifications, or financial aid appeals.\nAn individual can access supportive measures even if they do not file a formal complaint or choose not to proceed with a formal investigation.\nWhat is the difference between reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator and reporting to police? What standard of evidence is used in these processes?\nThe university\xe2\x80\x99s formal investigation process, which is coordinated by the USU Office of Equity, is an administrative process that determines whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, a member of the campus community (student, staff, or faculty) has violated interim USU Policy 339 or 339A. The preponderance of the evidence standard means a policy violation is more likely than not to have occurred. If someone is found responsible for violating university policy, they may face administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, a warning, probation, suspension, or expulsion. The information about sexual misconduct that is reported may also result in campus offices participating in education and training.\nA criminal process, which may be coordinated by USU Police or local law enforcement, determines whether a crime has occurred. If someone wishes to seek criminal penalties for sexual misconduct that is also a crime or other forms of assistance from law enforcement, they can report to the police. Criminal justice procedures use beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard of evidence, which is a higher standard of evidence than the standard used in USU\xe2\x80\x99s grievance process.\nBoth processes may be pursued simultaneously.\nWhat if the individual who experienced sexual misconduct wants to keep their information confidential?\nThe USU Title IX Coordinator will consider requests for confidentiality (meaning that an individual doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want their name connected to the incident or report) or that no investigation or disciplinary action be pursued. These requests are evaluated in the context of the university\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment.\nAn individual has the option of not providing information to the Office of Equity and not pursuing an investigation. However, the Office of Equity will still conduct a safety assessment with the limited information available to ensure the safety of the campus community.\nConfidential resources are available both on- and off-campus.\nDoes USU discipline students for drug and alcohol student code violations discovered when reporting to the USU Title IX Coordinator?\nNo, if a student who experiences or witnesses an incident of sexual misconduct reports it to the USU Title IX Coordinator, they will not get in trouble for a student code violation related to the incident, such as underage drinking or having alcohol on campus.\nThe health and safety of our community is our primary concern, and we want to remove barriers to reporting sexual misconduct to USU\'s Title IX Coordinator. USU\xe2\x80\x99s student code includes an amnesty provision to excuse students who report sexual misconduct from facing discipline for a student code violation involving drugs and alcohol.\nWhat are the reporting obligations of USU staff, faculty, and other academic appointees?\nSome university employees are designated as reporting employees, which means they must report all information they receive about sexual misconduct or incidents of sexual misconduct about which they have knowledge to the USU Title IX Coordinator at equity.usu.edu/report.\nThe university provides designated confidential resources - medical professionals and medical staff, professional counselors, non-professional counselors, and advocates - so individuals who have been impacted by sexual misconduct can have access to support services in a confidential setting.\nSome university employees are designated as non-designated employees, which means they are not required to report information they receive about sexual misconduct to the USU Title IX Coordinator, but are required to share information about resources and reporting to the Title IX Coordinator to individuals who disclose sexual misconduct to them.\nWho does the Office of Equity share the initial report with?\nThe Office of Equity keeps the initial report private but may share some information with specific USU employees, including when it is necessary to assess the safety risk posed by an incident or to provide an individual with supportive measures.\nFor example, if there is an immediate safety risk to an individual or to campus, the\xc2\xa0USU Title IX Coordinator\xc2\xa0may share information with local police\xc2\xa0or USU Police, including so that USU Police may evaluate for a\xc2\xa0timely warning notice, in accordance with the federal Clery Act.
