Title IX Laws:Discrimination and Harassment - Know Your Rights
What is Title IX?
Title IX is a federal law that was passed in 1972 to ensure that male and female students and employees in educational settings are treated equally and fairly. It protects against discrimination based on sex (including sexual harassment). In addition, Title IX protects transgender students and students who do not conform to gender stereotypes. State law also prohibits discrimination based on gender (sex), gender expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
Our County Office of Education and the Title IX Coordinator are aware of and acknowledge the new Title IX regulations released on May 6, 2020 and effective as of August 14, 2020.  Our Title IX team will be receiving training on these new regulations in the near future, and will make our training materials available online for review.  We are in the process of reviewing and revising our Title IX policy and practices, which involves hearing from our stake-holders in order to implement a fair, thorough, and impartial Title IX complaint process and COE response.
Student Rights Under Title IX
Federal Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), implemented at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31, subd. (a), provides that no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a recipient which receives federal financial assistance. Title IX requires school districts to take immediate and appropriate action to investigate when it knows or reasonably should know of a possible Title IX violation.

Filing a Title IX ComplaintAny parent, guardian, individual, organization has the right to file a written complaint of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and/or bullying on the basis of a protected characteristic within six months from the date the alleged incident occurred or the complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged incident.
How PCOE Investigates a ComplaintWithin 60 days from the date of receipt of the complaint, the district shall conduct and complete an investigation of the complaint and prepare a written decision.
