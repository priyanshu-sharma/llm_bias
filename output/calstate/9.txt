Dear County and  District Superintendents; Superintendents of State Special Schools; and Public,  Charter, and Private School Administrators:
SEX  EQUITY IN EDUCATION ACT ANNUAL NOTIFICATION
Title IX  remains a critical federal civil rights law which prohibits discrimination on  the basis of sex (including sexual harassment) in our schools. It protects male  and female students and employees in any educational entity that receives  federal funds. In addition, Title IX protects transgender students and students  who do not conform to sex stereotypes. State law also prohibits discrimination  based on gender (sex), gender expression, gender identity, and sexual  orientation.
California Education  Code Section 221.61 strengthens and expands upon Title IX and state sex  equity in education requirements. Specifically, by July 1, 2017, public  schools, private schools, school districts, county offices of education, and  charter schools receiving federal funding were required to post information on  their internet website relative to the designated Title IX Coordinator, the  rights of students and the responsibilities of schools, and a description of  how to file a complaint. Schools should continue to monitor and update  information to reflect changes in staff as well as any state and federal legal  requirements.
To fully  understand the Title IX requirements, we recommend an examination of 34 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 106.  Additionally, the law may not be applicable to all private schools receiving  federal funds. There are specific federal guidelines allowing exemptions to the  Title IX requirements if funds are received under the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act (ESEA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA). For more information, please visit the Office of Civil Rights’ Frequently Asked Questions page.
These  requirements are essential to ensure equity in education, and your efforts are  greatly appreciated. If you have any questions, please contact my staff by  phone at 916-445-9174 or by email at oeoinfo@cde.ca.gov.
Sincerely,
[Original  copy on file at CDE]

Nondiscrimination Statement
The State of California, Department of Education (CDE), is committed to  ensuring equal, fair, and meaningful access to employment and education  services. The CDE does not discriminate in any employment practice, education  program, or educational activity on the basis and/or association with a person  or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics of age,  ancestry, color, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender  expression, genetic information, marital status, medical condition, military or  veteran status, national origin, immigration status, political affiliation,  pregnancy and related conditions, race, religion, retaliation, sex (including  sexual harassment), sexual orientation, or any other basis prohibited by  California state and federal nondiscrimination laws respectively. Not all bases  of discrimination will apply to both education services and employment. The  Office of Equal Opportunity is charged with overseeing, leading, and directing  the CDE’s efforts to meet the legal obligations set forth in state and federal  civil rights laws, and regulations in CDE employment and delivery of education  services. Inquiries regarding nondiscrimination and civil rights should be  directed to the Office of Equal Opportunity.

Implementation of the Sex Equity in Education Act
The following information from state and federal statute was gathered to assist in understanding how the amendments in SB 1375 expand upon the requirements of Title IX. This is not an exhaustive examination and, therefore, should not be used as a substitute for careful reading of the regulations themselves.
Sex Equity in Education Act
California Education Code, 221.61
On or before July 1, 2017, public schools,  private schools that receive federal funds and are subject to the requirements  of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools  shall post in a prominent and conspicuous location on their Internet Web sites  all of the following:
The name and  contact information of the Title IX coordinator for that public school, private  school, school district, county office of education, or charter school, which  shall include the Title IX coordinator’s phone number and email address.
The rights of a  pupil and the public and the responsibilities of the public school, private  school, school district, county office of education, or charter school under  Title IX, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, Internet Web links  to information about those rights and responsibilities located on the Internet  Web sites of the department’s Office for Equal Opportunity and the United  States Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, and the list of rights  specified in Section 221.8.
A description of  how to file a complaint under Title IX, which shall include all of the  following:
An explanation of the statute of  limitations within which a complaint must be filed after an alleged incident of  discrimination has occurred, and how a complaint may be filed beyond the  statute of limitations.
An explanation of how the complaint will be  investigated and how the complainant may further pursue the complaint,  including, but not limited to, Internet Web links to this information on the  United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights’ Internet Web  site.
An Internet Web link to the United States  Department of Education Office for Civil Rights complaints form, and the  contact information for the office, which shall include the phone number and  email address for the office.
On or before April 1, 2017, and annually  thereafter, the Superintendent shall send a letter through electronic means to  all public schools, private schools that receive federal funds and are subject  to the requirements of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education,  and charter schools informing them of the requirement specified in subdivision  (a) and of their responsibilities under Title IX.
A public school that does not maintain an  Internet Web site may comply with subdivision (a) by posting the information  specified in paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, of subdivision (a) on the  Internet Web site of its school district or county office of education.
Nothing in this section shall be construed  to require a school or local educational agency to establish an Internet Web  site if the school or local educational agency does not already maintain one.
Title IX Requirements
34 CFR [Code of Federal Regulations] 106.8
Designation of responsible employee. Each recipient shall designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under this part, including any investigation of any complaint communicated to such recipient alleging its noncompliance with this part or alleging any actions which would be prohibited by this part.

Each recipient shall implement specific and continuing steps to notify applicants for admission and employment, students and parents of elementary and secondary school students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and employment, and all unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient, that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational program or activity which it operates, and that it is required by Title IX and this part not to discriminate in such a manner. Such notification shall contain such information and be made in such manner as the Assistant Secretary finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and this part, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in the education program or activity extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless Subpart C does not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and this part to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to Sec. 106.8, or to the Assistant Secretary.
Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of the effective date of this part or of the date this part first applies to such recipient, whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:

A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the type described in this paragraph which suggests, by text or illustration, that such recipient treats applicants, students, or employees differently on the basis of sex except as such treatment is permitted by this part.
