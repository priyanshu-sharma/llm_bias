A person\xe2\x80\x99s words or conduct are sufficient to constitute Sexual Coercion if they wrongfully impair another individual\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of will and ability to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity. Sexual Coercion includes but is not limited to intimidation, manipulation, express or implied threats of emotional or physical harm, and/or blackmail. Examples of Sexual Coercion include but are not limited to causing the deliberate Incapacitation of another person; conditioning an academic benefit or employment advantage on submission to the sexual contact; threatening to harm oneself if the other party does not engage in sexual contact; or threatening to disclose an individual\xe2\x80\x99s sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or other personal sensitive information if the other party does not engage in the sexual contact.\n3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sexual Exploitation: Taking non-consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another person for one\xe2\x80\x99s own advantage or benefit or for the advantage or benefit of anyone other than the person being exploited.\n4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sexual Intimidation: Threatening behavior of a sexual nature directed at another person, such as threatening to sexually assault another person or engaging in indecent exposure.\n5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Attempted Sexual Assault: An attempt to commit Sexual Assault.\n6.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other Sex-Based Offenses: Unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome requests for sexual favors, or other behavior of a sexual or gender-based nature where:\na.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s employment, evaluation of academic work, or participation in a University-sponsored educational program or activity;\nb.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for an academic, employment, or activity or program participation decision affecting that individual; or\nc.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Such conduct has the effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s academic or work performance, i.e., it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an intimidating, hostile, humiliating, demeaning, or sexually offensive working, academic, residential, or social environment.\nC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Retaliation means intimidating, threatening, coercing, or discriminating against, or otherwise taking an adverse action against an individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law or University policy relating to Prohibited Conduct, or because an individual has made a report, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to Prohibited Conduct. Adverse actions include but are not limited to impeding an individual\xe2\x80\x99s academic advancement; terminating, refusing to hire, or refusing to promote an individual; or transferring or assigning an individual to a lesser position in terms of wages, hours, job classification, or job security. Retaliation includes retaliatory harassment. Adverse actions, including charges against an individual for violations of other University policies that do not involve sex discrimination or Prohibited Conduct, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or complaint of Prohibited Conduct, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, constitutes Retaliation. However, charging an individual with a violation of other University policies for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a proceeding does not constitute Retaliation, provided that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any Party made a materially false statement in bad faith. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute Retaliation. The University will keep confidential, to the extent permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the identity of any individual who has made a report of Prohibited Conduct.\n[1] This definition encompasses the FBI uniform crime reporting system offenses required by Title IX.\n[2] The statutory age of consent in Maryland is 16.
