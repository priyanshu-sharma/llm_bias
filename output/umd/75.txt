The Pre-Law Advising Office within Letters and Sciences serves all current and former students at the University of Maryland interested in pursuing law school and careers in law. The program provides students with law school planning, including individual and group advising, career preparation workshops, admission information, and much more. While law schools do not require, favor, or prefer specific majors, the pre-law advisor can provide guidance concerning the choice of major. Pre-law does not serve as an undergraduate major, nor does the program require completion of a specific academic curriculum.

http://ensp.umd.edu
Environmental Science and Policy (ENSP) is a multi-disciplinary undergraduate major co-sponsored by the Colleges of Agriculture and Natural Resources; Behavioral and Social Sciences; and Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences. By combining a challenging multi-disciplinary program with practical experience, ENSP students gain an appreciation for the ways science, social systems, and policy interact; and are prepared to take roles in responding to the world's emerging environmental challenges.
Director: Dr. Mark Carroll
Assistant Director: Ms. Angela Mazur-Gray
Principal Lecturer: Mrs. Joanna Goger

Sustainability Studies Minor (AGNR)
Advising is mandatory for all ENSP students in all areas of concentration, regardless of GPA, concentration, or credit level. We want to help you meet program requirements while achieving your academic and career goals. Refer to the ENSP webpage at http://ensp.umd.edu to find advisor assignments.
Undergraduate Research Experiences
We encourage all interested students to gain research experience. Many beginning ENSP students gain their first research experience by participating in the Maryland Student Researchers Program, which is coordinated by the Maryland Center for Undergraduate Research. More advanced students gain research experience working with their faculty members; in a field assistantship at the USDA - Beltsville Agricultural Research Center or the US FWS - Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge; or by participating in an NSF-sponsored Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). Additionally, highly motivated and capable students are encouraged to enroll in Honors-in-ENSP to pursue a self-directed, individual project. Details about all of these opportunities are available on our website.
Internships
Practical experience is an important part of learning. Whether gained by volunteering, clubs, internships, and/or research — all experience contributes to students' professional development, helps determine what they enjoy doing, and makes classwork more meaningful. ENSP maintains an extensive list of internship opportunities on its website (http://ensp.umd.edu) and students receive weekly listserv announcements generated from the Advising Blog (http://enspadvisingnews.blogspot.com). Many of ENSP's concentrations require an internship; and most ENSP students complete at least two such experiences. ENSP students can earn credit for an internship experience via ENSP386. Students should review the ENSP webpage for details on this process.
Departmental Honors Program
The Honors Program in Environmental Science and Policy provides energetic and capable undergraduates the opportunity to engage in independent study. Interested students must have 45-75 credits at the time of application; a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher; and a 3.5 or higher in all courses required for ENSP. Transfer students with equivalent academic records are also encouraged to apply. All students who meet the application requirements are eligible to apply; they need not have been a member of University Honors Program. The research will be conducted under the supervision of a faculty mentor, usually in the student's area of concentration, and will result in an Honors thesis. More information about admission, program requirements, and academic resources is available on the website (http://ensp.umd.edu).
Scholarships and Financial Assistance
The Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) administers all types of federal, state and institutional financial assistance programs and, in cooperation with other university offices, participates in the awarding of scholarships to deserving students. For information, visit: http://financialaid.umd.edu.
Student Societies and Professional Organizations
UMD ENSPire: ENSPire is the ENSP Student Advisory board. With representatives from each academic class, ENSPire strives to unite ENSP majors and those with a genuine interest in bettering the environment through academics, professional development, community service, exploration of nature, and social activity.

Environmental Science and Policy Major
Overview
Requirements
Four-Year Plan
Program Director: Mark Carroll, Ph.D.
Environmental Science and Policy is a broadly multi-disciplinary, undergraduate major, drawing courses and faculty from 9 departments and three colleges (the Colleges of Agriculture and Natural Resources; Behavioral and Social Sciences; Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences). New ENSP students begin in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, where they will be guided through a structured, exploratory advising process. ENSP students are expected to declare a concentration by the end of their third semester in the program and, once they declare their concentration, will move administratively to the college and department sponsoring the concentration. There, they are advised by a faculty member in their discipline. The ENSP faculty and staff aspire to provide a strong identity for the students enrolled in this major, and we encourage students to take advantage of the rich resources available at a Research I public university.  Experiential learning through research, internships, and study abroad is strongly encouraged.
Admission to the Major
Incoming students who wish to enter ENSP may do so by selecting ENSP-Undeclared on their application for admission. On-campus students may declare ENSP during a meeting with the Assistant Director. Please review the ENSP website at http://ensp.umd.edu to learn about the program and its requirements prior to your first advising meeting.
Program Objectives
The curriculum of Environmental Science and Policy comprises an introductory core of lower-level courses in environmental science, environmental policy, biology, chemistry, earth sciences, geography, economics, calculus, and statistics. This is followed by in-depth and focused training in one of eleven areas of concentration in biological resources, earth systems, or the human dimensions of the field; and two upper-level courses in applied science and policy. The educational philosophy of the program is to train students broadly using a multi-disciplinary approach at the introductory level so that they are exposed to the myriad ways there are to learn about environmental systems and to address human-environment issues. This introductory approach precedes the concentration in which the students are prepared for post-graduate study or work in a discipline-based field. The combination of the lower-level core courses and upper-level depth in a concentration prepares graduates to work and study independently or as members of teams in which they will be asked to be experts in one area, while understanding and using effectively other natural and social science knowledge and investigative approaches.
Program Learning Outcomes
Utilize and integrate knowledge and understanding of natural and social sciences. Depth and knowledge in an area of concentration. Readiness for full-time employment and grad school.

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry analyzing structures of power, especially as they are grounded in gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, ability, and other inequalities, and as they configure historical and contemporary struggles for social change. The department and faculty enjoy a global reputation for innovative theoretical and methodological interventions and for their attention to curriculum transformation and global women’s studies institution building. With a core faculty of eight and more than 80 affiliate faculty from across the campus, the program offers a B.A., M.A./Ph.D., undergraduate and graduate certificates in women, gender, and sexuality studies, a minor in black women’s studies, and an undergraduate minor and certificate in LGBTQ studies.

Advising is mandatory for all majors each semester. Please email wgss@umd.edu or call 301-405-6827 for an appointment.
Certificate students and minors are also encouraged to consult with the Harriet Tubman Department of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies academic advisor prior to registration each semester.
To review the academic plan for this major, go to http://arhu.umd.edu/academicsadvising/academic-plans/.
Experiential Learning (WGSS Scholarship in Practice Requirement)
As part of the major, students are required to complete a hands-on, practical learning experience. They may do so through a teaching assistantship, an undergraduate internship, or a research or creative works assistantship. Students in the certificate and minor programs may also apply for experiential learning.
The Undergraduate Teaching Assistantship (UTA) is an opportunity to work closely supporting a member of the department faculty in an undergraduate course. This structure allows UTAs to build expertise, develop pedagogical competencies, and strengthen their knowledge base in the areas of feminist, critical race, and queer pedagogical debates and approaches. This is especially relevant for students interested in careers in teaching or academia. UTA positions in WGSS are unpaid and credit bearing, students are required to enroll in 3 credits of WGSS 358. Priority for teaching assistantships is given to students who have successfully completed the course they wish to TA. Positions are advertised during the registration period for the semester in which they occur and assistants are chosen by the faculty member who they will support.
The Undergraduate Internship experience is designed to provide students with the opportunity to combine theory and practice and get hands on experience with women’s, gender, and sexuality issues in a workplace or organizational setting. The course has two components: work at the internship setting developing practical skill sets applicable to that environment, and work with a faculty mentor to prepare readings and/or research that provide a framework to think about the internship experience and an opportunity to reflect on the pragmatic and political issues. Internships can be taken for 3 - 6 credits based on the combined number of hours worked at the internship site and on associated academics. Students seek internship opportunities in local, state and federal governments, non-profit organizations, policy and research institutions as well as agencies committed to social change. Past internship sites have included: MCASA-Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, NAACP Maryland State Conference, National Organization for Women, Institute for Women's Policy Research, HIPS, League of Women Voters of Maryland, Sinister Wisdom lesbian literary and art journal, Jewish Women International, Asian Pacific Islander Domestic Violence Resource Project, D.C. Rape Crisis Center, the District Alliance for Safe Housing, the State of Maryland Lt. Governor's Office and other state and national legislative offices. To learn more about the Internship program visit http://wgss.umd.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/experiential-learning/.
The Undergraduate Research and Creative Works Assistant (URCA) provides an opportunity to work alongside a faculty mentor to develop an enhanced understanding of specific research methods and/or creative practices; the overall goal is to provide students with an understanding of how field contributions are made, either by crafting their own research contributions, or providing support for a faculty mentor’s ongoing research. Positions are generally advertised during the registration period in which they occur and are chosen by the faculty member who will be directing them.
Departmental Honors Program
The Honors Program is designed to give students the opportunity to pursue an area of passionate academic interest in greater depth than that allowed by formal classes. Honors students engage in rigorous interdisciplinary research under the close supervision and mentorship of a department faculty member. Students can be expected to gain a deeper understanding of some aspect of women's, gender, and/or sexuality studies and to develop habits of self-reliance, individual initiative, and critical analysis. The culminating thesis may be a sustained piece of writing or a substantial creative or activist project. Applications to the Departmental Honors Program are accepted in mid-Fall and mid-Spring.
Student Community
The Harriet Tubman Department of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) strives to build a vibrant community of students. Undergraduate and graduate students are given voice at the department level through the election of a student representative who participates in department faculty meetings. The department has a vibrant series of Social Justice Hangouts and other events held each year to bring together students and faculty from all our programs and the broader university community. To learn more about this community visit http://wgss.umd.edu/current-students/.
Triota
Iota, Iota, Iota (Triota) is a national Women's Studies Honor Society. The UMD chapter is a student run organization that strives to maintain feminist values of egalitarianism and inclusiveness. It celebrates the diversity of experiences that are central to Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. Triota works to promote student research and activism in socio-political issues that affect all minority groups and aims to recognize and promote the academic achievements of students enrolled in WGSS and LGBT courses. For more information please contact wgss@umd.edu.
Scholarships and Financial Assistance
For information about scholarships and financial assistance offered by the department, please visit http://wgss.umd.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/scholarships-awards/.
The Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) administers all types of federal, state and institutional financial assistance programs and, in cooperation with other university offices, participates in the awarding of scholarships to deserving students. For information, visit: http://financialaid.umd.edu.
Awards and Recognition
The department administers a variety of awards and grants to encourage and recognize outstanding scholarship, research, leadership and service.
The Rodler/Wood Scholarship is awarded annually based on one or more of the following criteria: demonstrated financial need, hardship based on sexual orientation, academic interest in LGBT Studies, and extracurricular activities on behalf of LGBT issues. The Rodler/Wood Scholarship is presented at the annual Lavender Graduation ceremony each spring.
Each fall the department funds travel awards to support the participation of undergraduate students in the National Women’s Studies Association Annual Conference. Any student in the university who has completed 12 credits of WMST and/or LGBT courses is eligible to apply for the NWSA travel award.
The department also recognizes graduating students who have excelled in academics or in service to the campus and community at our Departmental Commencement Ceremony.
For information on any of these awards, including how to apply, contact the department at wgss@umd.edu or visit http://wgss.umd.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/scholarships-awards/.

The Harriet Tubman Department of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies offers an interdisciplinary undergraduate certificate and a minor in LGBTQ Studies. These programs are designed to examine the lives, experiences, identities and representations of LGBTQ persons, those who are today described as having a minority sexual orientation or who are gender transgressive.
The university has two scholarships specifically related to LGBTQ studies and LGBTQ issues: The Rodler/Wood Scholarship is awarded annually based on one or more of the following criteria: demonstrated financial need, hardship based on sexual orientation, academic interest in LGBT Studies, and extracurricular activities on behalf of LGBT issues. The Novak Family TerpStart Endowed Scholarship is awarded to an undergraduate student participating in the department's LGBTQ Studies Program.
For additional information, or to initiate the process of declaring the certificate or minor, please contact the undergraduate advisor at wgss@umd.edu or 301-405-6827.

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Major
Overview
Requirements
Four-Year Plan
Department Chair: Neda Atanasoski, Ph.D.
Rooted in the academic and political histories of Women’s Studies, the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies B.A. centers the study of structural inequity, as grounded in intersecting hierarchies of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, and ability. The WGSS major provides students with an opportunity to develop a scholarly and applied understanding of social justice, honing a radical vision for political, economic, and societal freedom. Students will take courses informed by intersectional scholarship and methodologies from the arts and humanities, social sciences, public health, psychology, government, and public policy, among others. Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies offers students a flexible program of study in which there is focused attention on building students’ analysis and critique of the most pressing issues of the day, such as anti-black racism, reproductive justice, discriminatory practices against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, xenophobia and antisemitism, silencing of indigenous communities and structural exclusion by practices of ageism and ableism.   Our introductory courses, which offer the option of focusing on social sciences or artistic methods, equip students with the tools and vocabulary to both analyze and respond creatively to social problems. Upper-division courses, which are usually run as small-size seminars, focus on building students’ research skills for pursuing topics of special interest. The final year of the B.A. degree specifically prepares students for jobs through guided internship courses that involve regular interaction with both a worksite supervisor and an assigned faculty member.  Senior-level seminars focus on the development of skills and knowledge that can inform careers in a wide range of areas, including non-profit management, social justice advocacy, digital and media expression, law, health-related fields, student affairs, academia, and government and public policy.  We seek to shape a new generation of scholars and leaders who, with us, will work to acknowledge, understand, and critically interrogate hierarchies of difference, while imagining more just futures. Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronyms: WGSS, LGBT.
Program Learning Outcomes
Students are expected to fully engage with the curriculum and the opportunities presented for learning and research. Having completed the program, students should have acquired the following knowledge, skills, and practices:
An ability to critically analyze issues related to women, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class A demonstrated engagement with the practices of feminist, critical race, and LGBTQ social action An ability to do independent research using appropriate methods An ability to use effective forms of communication
Students will earn a total of 37 credit hours, distributed as indicated below. Drawing from approximately fifty courses, many of which are cross-listed with other academic units, students will have the opportunity to design an emphasis within the major relevant to their special interests. A number of courses may count in more than one category. At least 31 credits must be at or above the 3xx level. No course with a grade less than "C-" may be used to satisfy the major. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the major is required for graduation. Students will design their programs in consultation with a Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies advisor.

The Department of Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership is one of three newly formed departments within the College of Education. It is a union of former units Curriculum and Instruction (EDCI), Education Policy Studies (EDPS) and Organizational Leadership and Policy Studies (OLPS). Interrelated program areas currently include: Art Integration, Curriculum Theory and Development, Education Policy, Elementary Education, English Education, Literacy Education, Mathematics Education, Middle School Education, Minority and Urban Education, Organizational Leadership, Reading Education, Science Education, Second Language/TESOL, Social Studies Education, Professional Development/Teacher Education, and Sociocultural Foundations of Education.
Most of the college's teacher preparation programs (including elementary, middle, and secondary education) are housed in TLPL.  Additional departmental programs encourage thoughtful and responsive explorations of education policies, practices and related social issues. Graduate students are prepared to create and critique alternative courses of action to enhance the quality of education for all persons and to redress the social conditions that restrict collective democratic aspirations.
The department offers undergraduate and graduate study leading to the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Master of Arts (M.A.) (thesis and non-thesis options), Master of Education (M.Ed.), Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).
Foreign-Language Requirement, Bachelor of Arts Degree
Beginning Fall 2011 high school language will no longer place undergraduates in foreign language classes nor exempt individuals from taking the foreign language placement exam. All teacher candidates planning to study a foreign language will be required to take a foreign language placement test. This test is used to determine the appropriate placement prior to course registration. For more information, contact the Office of Student Affairs in the College of Arts and Humanities at arhuadvising@umd.edu or 301-405-2108.

Advising is mandatory for all elementary, middle school math and science and secondary education majors. For more information or to schedule an advising appointment, contact the Office of Student Services (301-405-2364) or email questions/inquiries to ed-advising@umd.edu.
Internships
The yearlong internship, which is the culminating experience in the teacher preparation program, takes place in a public PDS school setting.
Scholarships and Financial Assistance
The Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) administers all types of federal, state and institutional financial assistance programs and, in cooperation with other university offices, participates in the awarding of scholarships to deserving students. For information, visit: http://financialaid.umd.edu.
The College of Education also offers a number of scholarships. For more information, see http://education.umd.edu/admissions/financial-aid-scholarships/.
Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities
In addition to the double major program, the Department of Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership offers a Five-Year Integrated Master's with Certification Program (IMCP). This program is intended for talented undergraduates with a minimum GPA of 3.0 who seek to combine undergraduate studies in the content area and professional education as a foundation for a focused professional year at the graduate level leading to secondary-level certification (grades 7-12) in the subject field and the Master of Education degree. As undergraduates, teacher candidates are double majors in both secondary education and their content area. While double majors, undergraduates complete a minimum of 12 credits in professional education studies related to teacher certification requirements. In their junior or senior year they apply to the graduate program. If they are admitted to the graduate program they enroll in a full-year internship. These individuals will also complete graduate-level professional studies that make them eligible for initial teacher certification and the Master of Education degree. Information about this secondary education program option is available at http://education.umd.edu/academics/programs/teacher-certification/.

Overview

http://spp.umd.edu/your-education/undergraduate/minors/science-technology-ethics-and-policy-step-minor/
Program Director: David Tomblin, Ph.D.
The minor in Science, Technology, Ethics and Policy (STEP) explores the powerful social, ethical, and political relationships that drive research and innovation. The program delves into the challenges of living and innovating in a world where emerging science and technologies are becoming increasingly interconnected, pervasive, and powerful.  The STEP minor offers students the knowledge and analytical skills to understand and assess the complex interactions among science, technology, policy and ethics, providing students the opportunity to explore the ways that scientific practice and technological development are embedded in social, cultural, humanistic, and political systems. STEP welcomes students from all majors who are interested in understanding how we can responsibly maximize the societal benefits of scientific inquiry and technological innovation. The program’s primary goal is to give students analytical skills that help connect science and technology to broader social needs. Coursework emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary modes of inquiry to generate new scientific knowledge and technologies, and to understanding the ethical considerations and social benefits that flow from them.  Electives are grouped in three concentrations, each linked to a learning outcome. Students can go deep in one concentration or choose across groupings.  The end product of the program is a capstone research project of the student’s own choosing, which is developed under faculty mentorship.  At the onset of the capstone course, students will complete an assignment that allows them to articulate how their elective courses have shaped their understanding of science, technology, ethics and policy and how it informs their choice of capstone project.  Minor concentration areas: Social, ethical and policy implications: This concentration explores the contemporary societal implications of science and technology. These courses ask students to think about the role science and technology have played in creating local and global social and environmental crises and what science and technology can do to help solve them. Science and technology development: This concentration focuses on cultural, legal, organizational, and institutional forces that have shaped science and technology. It asks students to think about what causes knowledge production and technical practices to change over time and how these changes can improve implementation going forward. Information economy: This concentration focuses on how the information economy has shaped scientific and technological practices. Students are asked to think about society’s evolving relationships with information as a driving force in the private and public sector.
Program Learning Outcomes
Articulate and explore the social, ethical, and policy implications of how scientific ideas emerge and technologies are designed, developed, and used (Social, ethical and policy implications concentration)  Identify political and legal contexts governing science and technology (Social, ethical and policy implications concentration) Recognize lessons from the historical contingency and legacy of scientific knowledge and technological development (Science and technology development concentration) Synthesize broad implications of the “information economy” for science, technology, and society (Information economy concentration) Interpret the rules, customs, and cultural practices that are the foundation for scientific and technological institutions.

The Public Policy major has mandatory advising every semester. Academic advising is an ongoing process that helps students clarify their educational and career goals, and then chart a meaningful plan for achieving those goals. Advising is the joint responsibility of the student and the advisor. The advisor assists students in evaluating their degree progress and helps them select appropriate courses and other educational experiences tailored to their personal goals. Ultimately, students are responsible for making decisions, setting and meeting identified goals and published requirements. More information for students can be found here. Students can contact the Public Policy advising office by calling 301-405-6330 or emailing plcyundergrad@umd.edu.

Program Director: Jennifer Littlefield, Ph.D.
With no shortage of complex challenges, the world needs leaders who are able to understand and communicate the issues, who can design and implement bold solutions and who can ethically and compassionately lead the movements and organizations that create real change. As a PolicyTerp, students will:
Learn how to analyze the issues to create and critically evaluate responses that promote better outcomes for communities.
Cross disciplinary boundaries to better understand the complexities of the challenges the world faces and immerse yourself in multiple perspectives.
Develop decision-making and leadership skills to translate theory and analysis into on-the-ground action.
The interdisciplinary Public Policy major focuses on using analytical decision-making to study an array of subjects ranging from the processes of making, implementing and evaluating government policies to the ethical evaluation of contemporary social problems, both domestic and international. The major has two distinctive components:  core foundational skills critical for the understanding and analysis of problems and proposed solutions; and the application of these skills and competencies to address challenges in the real world by engaging with the policy process at local, state and national levels through real-time projects.   The major in Public Policy at the University of Maryland equips students with competence in leadership and analytical skills, supported by theory and data, to prepare them for careers in public service, policymaking, and the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronym: PLCY.
Program Learning Outcomes
Students completing a Public Policy major will:
Understand public policy problems, concepts, processes, institutions and actors through a multidisciplinary lens, with perspectives from the local to the global.  Analyze public issues from a range of ideological, demographic, and socioeconomic perspectives, including those that are underrepresented in the public policy process.  Apply quantitative and qualitative tools to real-world policy issues.  Communicate complex ideas and findings in written and oral forms.  Demonstrate teamwork, ethical decision-making, management and leadership skills. \
C- or better is required in all major courses and the cumulative average of these courses must be a 2.0.     Course List        Course Title Credits    Benchmark Requirement One   1 PLCY100Foundations of Public Policy3 HIST201Interpreting American History: From 1865 to the Present3 Benchmark Requirement Two 2 PLCY101Great Thinkers on Public Policy3 STAT100Elementary Statistics and Probability3 (STAT100 equivalent accepted) Required Major Courses ECON200Principles of Microeconomics3 PLCY201Public Leaders and Active Citizens3 PLCY203Liberty and Justice for All: Ethics and Moral Issues in Public Policy3 PLCY300Governance: Collective Action in the Public Interest3 PLCY302Examining Pluralism in Public Policy (UP Pending)3 PLCY303Public Economics Raising and Spending the People's Money3 PLCY304Evaluating Evidence: Finding Truth in Numbers4 PLCY306Public Policy Analysis in Action 33 PLCY309Internship in Political Institutions: State and Local3-6 PLCY400Senior Capstone 43 PLCY401Contemporary Issues in Public Policy 43 Introduction to Public Policy Focus or General Policy elective3 Students may choose an area of focus or choose general policy related electives  Focus/PLCY Elective Course 23 Focus/PLCY Elective Course 33 Focus/PLCY Elective Course 43 Total Credits58-61    1  Must be completed by the end of two semesters into the major  2  Must be completed by the end of four semesters into the major  3  Taken after 60 credits  4  Taken after 90 credits

Overview

Program Director: David Tomblin, Ph.D.
The minor in Science, Technology, Ethics and Policy (STEP) explores the powerful social, ethical, and political relationships that drive research and innovation. The program delves into the challenges of living and innovating in a world where emerging science and technologies are becoming increasingly interconnected, pervasive, and powerful.  The STEP minor offers students the knowledge and analytical skills to understand and assess the complex interactions among science, technology, policy and ethics, providing students the opportunity to explore the ways that scientific practice and technological development are embedded in social, cultural, humanistic, and political systems. STEP welcomes students from all majors who are interested in understanding how we can responsibly maximize the societal benefits of scientific inquiry and technological innovation. The program’s primary goal is to give students analytical skills that help connect science and technology to broader social needs. Coursework emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary modes of inquiry to generate new scientific knowledge and technologies, and to understanding the ethical considerations and social benefits that flow from them.  Electives are grouped in three concentrations, each linked to a learning outcome. Students can go deep in one concentration or choose across groupings.  The end product of the program is a capstone research project of the student’s own choosing, which is developed under faculty mentorship.  At the onset of the capstone course, students will complete an assignment that allows them to articulate how their elective courses have shaped their understanding of science, technology, ethics and policy and how it informs their choice of capstone project.  Minor concentration areas: Social, ethical and policy implications: This concentration explores the contemporary societal implications of science and technology. These courses ask students to think about the role science and technology have played in creating local and global social and environmental crises and what science and technology can do to help solve them. Science and technology development: This concentration focuses on cultural, legal, organizational, and institutional forces that have shaped science and technology. It asks students to think about what causes knowledge production and technical practices to change over time and how these changes can improve implementation going forward. Information economy: This concentration focuses on how the information economy has shaped scientific and technological practices. Students are asked to think about society’s evolving relationships with information as a driving force in the private and public sector.
Program Learning Outcomes

WGSS115 Gender, Race and Computing (3 Credits)  		Race and gender have shaped computing from its earliest histories to contemporary debates over bias in search algorithms, surveillance, and AI. As computational processes shape ever more dimensions of everyday life from the personal to the global scale, understanding how they operate and how power operates within them grows ever more important. Combating racism and sexism is not as simple as ensuring the pool of programmers and engineers is more diverse; structures of power are embedded in digital technologies as they are in all aspects of our society, and we must learn to perceive their operation if we hope to transform them. We will examine how racism and sexism operate in the field of computer science and in everyday uses of digital technologies, while studying how feminist and racial justice movements have created alternative approaches. This class is for anyone who wishes to better understand the relationships between digital technology, structural power, and social justice.	 Restriction:  Must not have taken CMSC216 or higher.

Prohibited Conduct Definitions
This Policy prohibits Sexual Harassment, Other Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation as set forth below. Prohibited Conduct can occur between strangers or acquaintances, including people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Prohibited Conduct can be committed by any person, regardless of gender identity, and can occur between people of the same or different sex, sexual orientation, or gender expression. For more information, view University of Maryland Policy and Procedures on Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct.
Sexual Harassment Definitions / Other Sexual Misconduct Definitions / Retaliation Definition
A. Sexual Harassment means conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:
1.      Quid Pro Quo: An employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct.
2.      Hostile Environment: Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the University’s Education Program or Activity.
3.      Sexual Assault: An offense classified as a sex offense under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Sex offenses are any sexual acts directed against another person, without the Consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving Consent (Non-Consensual Sexual Penetration or Fondling); also, unlawful sexual intercourse (Incest or Statutory Rape).
a.       Non-Consensual Sexual Penetration: Penetration, no matter how slight, of the genital or anal opening of the body of another person with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the Consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving Consent because of their age or because of their temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.[1]
b.   Fondling: The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification without the Consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving Consent because of their age or because of their temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.
c.   Incest: Nonforcible sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law.
d.   Statutory Rape: Nonforcible sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent.[2]
4.      Dating Violence: Violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors:
a.       The length of the relationship;
b.      The type of relationship; and
c.       The frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.
5.      Domestic Violence: Felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the Complainant, by a person with whom the Complainant shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the Complainant as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the Complainant under the domestic or family violence laws of Maryland, or by any other person against an adult or youth Complainant protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of Maryland.
6.      Stalking: Engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to:
a.       Fear for their own safety or the safety of others; or
b.      Suffer substantial emotional distress.
B.    Other Sexual Misconduct means the following conduct:
1.      Sexual Harassment that occurred against a person outside of the United States or not within an Education Program or Activity, or otherwise does not fall under Title IX.
2.      Sexual Coercion: The use of unreasonable pressure in an effort to compel another individual to initiate or continue sexual activity against the individual’s will. A person’s words or conduct are sufficient to constitute Sexual Coercion if they wrongfully impair another individual’s freedom of will and ability to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity. Sexual Coercion includes but is not limited to intimidation, manipulation, express or implied threats of emotional or physical harm, and/or blackmail. Examples of Sexual Coercion include but are not limited to causing the deliberate Incapacitation of another person; conditioning an academic benefit or employment advantage on submission to the sexual contact; threatening to harm oneself if the other party does not engage in sexual contact; or threatening to disclose an individual’s sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or other personal sensitive information if the other party does not engage in the sexual contact.
3.      Sexual Exploitation: Taking non-consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another person for one’s own advantage or benefit or for the advantage or benefit of anyone other than the person being exploited.
4.      Sexual Intimidation: Threatening behavior of a sexual nature directed at another person, such as threatening to sexually assault another person or engaging in indecent exposure.
5.      Attempted Sexual Assault: An attempt to commit Sexual Assault.
6.      Other Sex-Based Offenses: Unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome requests for sexual favors, or other behavior of a sexual or gender-based nature where:
a.       Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment, evaluation of academic work, or participation in a University-sponsored educational program or activity;
b.      Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for an academic, employment, or activity or program participation decision affecting that individual; or
c.       Such conduct has the effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s academic or work performance, i.e., it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an intimidating, hostile, humiliating, demeaning, or sexually offensive working, academic, residential, or social environment.
C.     Retaliation means intimidating, threatening, coercing, or discriminating against, or otherwise taking an adverse action against an individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law or University policy relating to Prohibited Conduct, or because an individual has made a report, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to Prohibited Conduct. Adverse actions include but are not limited to impeding an individual’s academic advancement; terminating, refusing to hire, or refusing to promote an individual; or transferring or assigning an individual to a lesser position in terms of wages, hours, job classification, or job security. Retaliation includes retaliatory harassment. Adverse actions, including charges against an individual for violations of other University policies that do not involve sex discrimination or Prohibited Conduct, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or complaint of Prohibited Conduct, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, constitutes Retaliation. However, charging an individual with a violation of other University policies for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a proceeding does not constitute Retaliation, provided that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any Party made a materially false statement in bad faith. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute Retaliation. The University will keep confidential, to the extent permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the identity of any individual who has made a report of Prohibited Conduct.
[1] This definition encompasses the FBI uniform crime reporting system offenses required by Title IX.
[2] The statutory age of consent in Maryland is 16. See Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law §§ 3-301 to -307.
