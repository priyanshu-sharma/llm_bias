Texas Launches Lawsuit Against Biden’s Unlawful Title IX Guidance Forcing “Transgender” Policies in Schools by Threatening Education Funds

Texas Launch­es Law­suit Against Biden’s Unlaw­ful Title IX Guid­ance Forc­ing ​“Trans­gen­der” Poli­cies in Schools by Threat­en­ing Edu­ca­tion Funds
The Office of the Attorney General has filed a lawsuit challenging the Biden Administration’s unlawful interpretation of Title IX, exposing the Department of Education’s new guidance as an illegal effort to force schools to adopt “transgender” ideology in schools or risk losing federal education funds. This is Texas’s 50th lawsuit against the Biden Administration.
Title IX is a federal statute that prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex” in educational institutions. Under Biden, the Department of Education has issued guidance arbitrarily expanding this category to include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” The guidance risks federal education funding for Texas colleges and universities as well as all Texas K-12 schools receiving any amount of federal funding by unlawfully asserting that these conceptions promoted by the extremist transgender movement are covered by Title IX protections.
Examples purported by the Biden Administration to be violations of Title IX include teachers failing to forcibly compel students to use classmates’ so-called “preferred pronouns,” schools’ policies enforcing separate bathroom facilities for biological males and females, and schools’ policies refusing to allow biological males to compete on female sports teams. Under this doctrine, Texas schools would be investigated by the federal government for following Texas law, including Chapter 33 of the Education Code protecting the integrity of school athletics participation on the basis of biological sex.
Texas is challenging this blatant attempt to misuse federal regulatory power to force K-12 schools, colleges, and universities in our state to accept and implement “transgender” ideology—in violation of state law—by misusing the Title IX statute to threaten the withholding of federal education funds. The Administration’s unlawful guidance could put at risk over $6 billion in federal funding that supports Texas K-12 and higher education institutions.

Paxton and Normangee ISD Announce Settlement with UBS to Compensate School District Over State Pro-Energy Law
May 12, 2023  | Press Release
|                 Education
Pax­ton and Nor­mangee ISD Announce Set­tle­ment with UBS to Com­pen­sate School Dis­trict Over State Pro-Ener­gy Law
Attorney General Paxton and Normangee Independent School District (“Normangee ISD”) announced a settlement with UBS in the amount of $850,000. The settlement resulted from the company’s inability to underwrite Normangee ISD’s bonds under the terms of a Texas law known as “SB 13,” which stipulates the terms on which certain companies can do business with state governmental entities.
“UBS’s actions in this case were costly, and it is critical that they compensate Normangee ISD to recover losses. That’s exactly what this settlement accomplishes,” said Attorney General Paxton. “I remain committed to combatting the corporate ESG investment agenda, shielding taxpayers from the extra costs that come with it by shifting the burden to banks, and protecting Texas energy companies.”
SB 13 requires financial companies who contract with Texas governments to certify that they do not boycott energy companies. UBS certified that it does not boycott energy companies when it entered into a contract to underwrite $18.6 million in bonds to be issued by Normangee ISD.
But the Texas Comptroller placed UBS and several other financial services firms on a list of energy boycotters in August 2022, and the Attorney General’s Public Finance Division concurred in that determination, thus disapproving the underwriting contract with Normangee ISD. Through no fault of its own, Normangee ISD then had to re-bid the contract at a higher interest rate, causing it financial harm. Attorney General Paxton then negotiated the settlement with UBS on Normangee ISD’s behalf.

Paxton Emphasizes Title IX Legal Protections for Female Athletes
April 24, 2023  | Press Release
|                 Education
Pax­ton Empha­sizes Title IX Legal Pro­tec­tions for Female Athletes
Attorney General Paxton joined an amicus brief to protect women’s sports from unfair and dangerous competition from biological men.
The Tennessee-led brief, filed in the New York City-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, highlights the protections for biological women under Title IX. For decades, Title IX has helped create opportunities for girls to participate in sports by prohibiting educational programs from discriminating on the basis of sex.
Despite recent attempts to radically alter the definition of “sex,” Title IX has long operated under the biological reality that there are two separate sexes: male and female. Given this fact, allowing subjective “gender identity” to trump biological sex would render much of Title IX unworkable.
Relying on a definition of “sex” that is entirely subjective allows biological men to compete against biological women, oftentimes hampering a key protection under Title IX, which is the “chance to be champions.” The brief describes recent events in Connecticut, highlighting instances in which biological boys were able to win a large number of track-and-field competitions when competing against women, limiting the athletic experience for biological girls.
The amicus brief states: “Providing girls the opportunity to experience the thrill of victory was one of the main athletic purposes of Title IX. At the time of Title IX’s enactment, the public understood that allowing biological boys to compete against girls would result in boys taking away championship opportunities designated for girls. In this circumstance, Defendants have failed to ‘effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes’ by refusing to offer truly sex-separated track-and-field competitions for the two sexes.”
