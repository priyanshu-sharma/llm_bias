This is Texas\xe2\x80\x99s 50th lawsuit against the Biden Administration.\nTitle IX is a federal statute that prohibits discrimination \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x9d in educational institutions. Under Biden, the Department of Education has issued guidance arbitrarily expanding this category to include \xe2\x80\x9csexual orientation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgender identity.\xe2\x80\x9d The guidance risks federal education funding for Texas colleges and universities as well as all Texas K-12 schools receiving any amount of federal funding by unlawfully asserting that these conceptions promoted by the extremist transgender movement are covered by Title IX protections.\nExamples purported by the Biden Administration to be violations of Title IX include teachers failing to forcibly compel students to use classmates\xe2\x80\x99 so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred pronouns,\xe2\x80\x9d schools\xe2\x80\x99 policies enforcing separate bathroom facilities for biological males and females, and schools\xe2\x80\x99 policies refusing to allow biological males to compete on female sports teams. Under this doctrine, Texas schools would be investigated by the federal government for following Texas law, including Chapter 33 of the Education Code protecting the integrity of school athletics participation on the basis of biological sex.\nTexas is challenging this blatant attempt to misuse federal regulatory power to force K-12 schools, colleges, and universities in our state to accept and implement \xe2\x80\x9ctransgender\xe2\x80\x9d ideology\xe2\x80\x94in violation of state law\xe2\x80\x94by misusing the Title IX statute to threaten the withholding of federal education funds. The Administration\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful guidance could put at risk over $6 billion in federal funding that supports Texas K-12 and higher education institutions.\nTo read the full lawsuit, click here.\nReceive email updates from the OAG Press Office:\nEmail Address\nSubmit\nRelated News\nPax\xc2\xadton Fights to Ensure that Vet\xc2\xader\xc2\xadans Receive Their Full Edu\xc2\xadca\xc2\xadtion\xc2\xadal Benefits\nAttorney General Paxton joined a multistate amicus brief that is in support of a U.S. Army veteran seeking full access to the educational benefits earned from his patriotic service to the country and multiple tours of duty.\nMay 22, 2023  | Press Release\nPax\xc2\xadton and Nor\xc2\xadmangee ISD Announce Set\xc2\xadtle\xc2\xadment with UBS to Com\xc2\xadpen\xc2\xadsate School Dis\xc2\xadtrict Over State Pro-Ener\xc2\xadgy\xc2\xa0Law\nAttorney General Paxton and Normangee Independent School District (\xe2\x80\x9cNormangee ISD\xe2\x80\x9d) announced a settlement with UBS in the amount of $850,000.\nMay 12, 2023  | Press Release\nPax\xc2\xadton Empha\xc2\xadsizes Title IX Legal Pro\xc2\xadtec\xc2\xadtions for Female Athletes\nAttorney General Paxton joined an amicus brief to protect women\xe2\x80\x99s sports from unfair and dangerous competition from biological men.\nApril 24, 2023  | Press Release\nSee all News\nBack to top\nBack to Top\nAsset 1\nTwitter\nFacebook\nPO Box 12548Austin, TX 78711-2548\nChild Support\nCrime Victims\nConsumer Protection\nOpen Government\nAll Divisions\nOpinions\nInitiatives\nHuman Resources\nNewsroom\nWhere the Money Goes\nADA Compliance\nCompact With Texans\nCost Efficiency Saving Ideas\nReporting Fraud\nState Agency Contracts\nTRAILS Search\nTexas Homeland Security\nTexas Veterans Portal\nTexas.gov\nAccessibility & Site Policies\""];

The settlement resulted from the company\xe2\x80\x99s inability to underwrite Normangee ISD\xe2\x80\x99s bonds under the terms of a Texas law known as \xe2\x80\x9cSB 13,\xe2\x80\x9d which stipulates the terms on which certain companies can do business with state governmental entities.\n\xe2\x80\x9cUBS\xe2\x80\x99s actions in this case were costly, and it is critical that they compensate Normangee ISD to recover losses. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what this settlement accomplishes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Attorney General Paxton. \xe2\x80\x9cI remain committed to combatting the corporate ESG investment agenda, shielding taxpayers from the extra costs that come with it by shifting the burden to banks, and protecting Texas energy companies.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSB 13 requires financial companies who contract with Texas governments to certify that they do not boycott energy companies. UBS certified that it does not boycott energy companies when it entered into a contract to underwrite $18.6 million in bonds to be issued by Normangee ISD.\nBut the Texas Comptroller placed UBS and several other financial services firms on a list of energy boycotters in August 2022, and the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Public Finance Division concurred in that determination, thus disapproving the underwriting contract with Normangee ISD. Through no fault of its own, Normangee ISD then had to re-bid the contract at a higher interest rate, causing it financial harm. Attorney General Paxton then negotiated the settlement with UBS on Normangee ISD\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.\nReceive email updates from the OAG Press Office:\nEmail Address\nSubmit\nRelated News\nTexas Launch\xc2\xades Law\xc2\xadsuit Against Biden\xe2\x80\x99s Unlaw\xc2\xadful Title IX Guid\xc2\xadance Forc\xc2\xading \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9cTrans\xc2\xadgen\xc2\xadder\xe2\x80\x9d Poli\xc2\xadcies in Schools by Threat\xc2\xaden\xc2\xading Edu\xc2\xadca\xc2\xadtion\xc2\xa0Funds\nThe Office of the Attorney General has filed a lawsuit challenging the Biden Administration\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful interpretation of Title IX, exposing the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s new guidance as an illegal effort to force schools to adopt \xe2\x80\x9ctransgender\xe2\x80\x9d ideology in schools or risk losing federal education funds.\nJune 14, 2023  | Press Release\nPax\xc2\xadton Fights to Ensure that Vet\xc2\xader\xc2\xadans Receive Their Full Edu\xc2\xadca\xc2\xadtion\xc2\xadal Benefits\nAttorney General Paxton joined a multistate amicus brief that is in support of a U.S. Army veteran seeking full access to the educational benefits earned from his patriotic service to the country and multiple tours of duty.\nMay 22, 2023  | Press Release\nPax\xc2\xadton Empha\xc2\xadsizes Title IX Legal Pro\xc2\xadtec\xc2\xadtions for Female Athletes\nAttorney General Paxton joined an amicus brief to protect women\xe2\x80\x99s sports from unfair and dangerous competition from biological men.\nApril 24, 2023  | Press Release\nSee all News\nBack to top\nBack to Top\nAsset 1\nTwitter\nFacebook\nPO Box 12548Austin, TX 78711-2548\nChild Support\nCrime Victims\nConsumer Protection\nOpen Government\nAll Divisions\nOpinions\nInitiatives\nHuman Resources\nNewsroom\nWhere the Money Goes\nADA Compliance\nCompact With Texans\nCost Efficiency Saving Ideas\nReporting Fraud\nState Agency Contracts\nTRAILS Search\nTexas Homeland Security\nTexas Veterans Portal\nTexas.gov\nAccessibility & Site Policies\""];

For decades, Title IX has helped create opportunities for girls to participate in sports by prohibiting educational programs from discriminating on the basis of sex.\nDespite recent attempts to radically alter the definition of \xe2\x80\x9csex,\xe2\x80\x9d Title IX has long operated under the biological reality that there are two separate sexes: male and female. Given this fact, allowing subjective \xe2\x80\x9cgender identity\xe2\x80\x9d to trump biological sex would render much of Title IX unworkable.\nRelying on a definition of \xe2\x80\x9csex\xe2\x80\x9d that is entirely subjective allows biological men to compete against biological women, oftentimes hampering a key protection under Title IX, which is the \xe2\x80\x9cchance to be champions.\xe2\x80\x9d The brief describes recent events in Connecticut, highlighting instances in which biological boys were able to win a large number of track-and-field competitions when competing against women, limiting the athletic experience for biological girls.\nThe amicus brief states: \xe2\x80\x9cProviding girls the opportunity to experience the thrill of victory was one of the main athletic purposes of Title IX. At the time of Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the public understood that allowing biological boys to compete against girls would result in boys taking away championship opportunities designated for girls. In this circumstance, Defendants have failed to \xe2\x80\x98effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members\xc2\xa0of both sexes\xe2\x80\x99 by refusing to offer truly sex-separated track-and-field competitions for the two sexes.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo read the full amicus brief, click here.\nReceive email updates from the OAG Press Office:\nEmail Address\nSubmit\nRelated News\nTexas Launch\xc2\xades Law\xc2\xadsuit Against Biden\xe2\x80\x99s Unlaw\xc2\xadful Title IX Guid\xc2\xadance Forc\xc2\xading \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9cTrans\xc2\xadgen\xc2\xadder\xe2\x80\x9d Poli\xc2\xadcies in Schools by Threat\xc2\xaden\xc2\xading Edu\xc2\xadca\xc2\xadtion\xc2\xa0Funds\nThe Office of the Attorney General has filed a lawsuit challenging the Biden Administration\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful interpretation of Title IX, exposing the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s new guidance as an illegal effort to force schools to adopt \xe2\x80\x9ctransgender\xe2\x80\x9d ideology in schools or risk losing federal education funds.\nJune 14, 2023  | Press Release\nPax\xc2\xadton Fights to Ensure that Vet\xc2\xader\xc2\xadans Receive Their Full Edu\xc2\xadca\xc2\xadtion\xc2\xadal Benefits\nAttorney General Paxton joined a multistate amicus brief that is in support of a U.S. Army veteran seeking full access to the educational benefits earned from his patriotic service to the country and multiple tours of duty.\nMay 22, 2023  | Press Release\nPax\xc2\xadton and Nor\xc2\xadmangee ISD Announce Set\xc2\xadtle\xc2\xadment with UBS to Com\xc2\xadpen\xc2\xadsate School Dis\xc2\xadtrict Over State Pro-Ener\xc2\xadgy\xc2\xa0Law\nAttorney General Paxton and Normangee Independent School District (\xe2\x80\x9cNormangee ISD\xe2\x80\x9d) announced a settlement with UBS in the amount of $850,000.\nMay 12, 2023  | Press Release\nSee all News\nBack to top\nBack to Top\nAsset 1\nTwitter\nFacebook\nPO Box 12548Austin, TX 78711-2548\nChild Support\nCrime Victims\nConsumer Protection\nOpen Government\nAll Divisions\nOpinions\nInitiatives\nHuman Resources\nNewsroom\nWhere the Money Goes\nADA Compliance\nCompact With Texans\nCost Efficiency Saving Ideas\nReporting Fraud\nState Agency Contracts\nTRAILS Search\nTexas Homeland Security\nTexas Veterans Portal\nTexas.gov\nAccessibility & Site Policies\""];
